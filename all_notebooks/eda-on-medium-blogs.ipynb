There is gonna be some reason behind this, let's see what it is\n\n* JPEG - JPEG is a lossy compression method used to ensure the digital images being used are as small as possible and load quickly when someone wants to view them. Here are some important points about it\n    * The file size of the image being compressed is permanently reduced by eliminating unnecessary (redundant) information from the image.\n    * Image quality does suffer, though it’s often so slight the average site visitor can’t tell.\n    \n    \n* JPG - Well, when it comes to .jpeg vs .jpg, the truth is there is no difference between the two except the number of characters.\n    * The term JPG exists because the earlier versions of Windows operating systems. Specifically, the MS-DOS 8.3 and FAT-16 file systems had a maximum 3-letter limit when it came to file names, unlike the UNIX-like operating systems like Mac or Linux, which didn’t have this limit.\n    \nI read these points in [this article](https://kinsta.com/blog/jpg-vs-jpeg/), you can check it out if you want to learn more about it\n\nwell coming to png's\n\n* PNG - Portable Network Graphics (PNGs) are just as popular as JPEGs on websites. They also support millions of colors, although you’re much better off using PNGs for images that contain less color data. Otherwise, your image is going to be ‘heavier’ than the same image saved as a JPEG.\n\nso we can conclude that\n\n1. JPEG/JPG: This is an ideal image format for all types of photographs.\n2. PNG: This format is perfect for screenshots and other types of imagery where there’s not a lot of color data.\n3. GIF: If you want to show off animated graphics on your site, this is the best image format for you.\n"},{"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":26584,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1600601905254,"user":{"displayName":"Kedar Kodgire","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjM1FF3JVPd_9UbyOOMI0jIkW_WD9mrwe46iAFP=s64","userId":"16678484096611308501"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"Cuy42K1KWjD7","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import jovian","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":26566,"status":"aborted","timestamp":1600601905257,"user":{"displayName":"Kedar Kodgire","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjM1FF3JVPd_9UbyOOMI0jIkW_WD9mrwe46iAFP=s64","userId":"16678484096611308501"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"mM9zHfxuWjEB","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"jovian.commit(project=project_name)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"LaHWqr5lWjEE"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Asking and Answering Questions\n\nwe have gained some insights about the blogs in the dataset and it also helped to understand how your next article should be.

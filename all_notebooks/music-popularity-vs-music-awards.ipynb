The Grammy data set initially has over 400 entrys but when we merge it with the Spotify dataset, it got cut to about 220 entrys. Maybe some of the songs that got awarded are not recorded in Spotify, but since the Spotify database, that is not likely. If we had more time, we would look into what happened in the merging process and check if formatting issues are causing the elimination of those entries.\n    Also, the Spotify dataset include many lyricless music, including classical music, piano compositions, electric lyricless music and so on.

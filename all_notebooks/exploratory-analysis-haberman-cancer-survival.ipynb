We see a negative correlation coefficient of approximately -0.281 when comparing age with number of patients that survived. Looking into the square of the correlation coefficient, R-squared, which represents the degree or extent to which the variance of one variable is related to the variance of the second variable, and is typically expressed in percentage terms, we observed a value of approximately 0.0790. This value shows that 7.9% of the variation in survived counts can be explained by age.

(i) First, a network based on clinical characteristics (i.e. site of onset, age at onset, time to diagnosis, ALSFRS slope, FVC, C9orf72 phenotype status, FTD status and El Escorial criteria diagnostic category) is fitted, consisting of 158 and 448 hidden nodes. (ii) Next, a network is fitted based on connectivity matrices, storing white matter connectivity strengths in terms of FA, composing of 134 and 313 hidden nodes. (iii) Third, a network based on brain morphology (68 cortical thickness values and 15 subcortical volumes) is fitted, consisting of 181 and 178 hidden nodes. (iv) The output nodes of these three networks are used as input nodes for the combination network, consisting of 171 and 108 hidden nodes. From the output nodes of each network a class label can be derived, revealing the survival prediction of a patient.\n\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2213158216301899-gr2.jpg)https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158216301899#t0005"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install PyPDF2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Codes by Gaurav Dutta https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit/working-with-pdf-files\n\n# note the capitalization\nimport PyPDF2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Notice we read it as a binary with 'rb'\nf = open('../input/cusersmarildownloadsalspdf/als.pdf','rb')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_reader.numPages","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"page_one = pdf_reader.getPage(0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"page_one_text = page_one.extractText()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"page_one_text","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f = open('../input/cusersmarildownloadsalspdf/als.pdf','rb')\npdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(f)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"first_page = pdf_reader.getPage(0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Copy a page and add it to another new document!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_writer.addPage(first_page)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_output = open(\"./First_Page.pdf\",\"wb\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_writer.write(pdf_output)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pdf_output.close()\nf.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f = open('../input/cusersmarildownloadsalspdf/als.pdf','rb')\n\n# List of every page's text.\n# The index will correspond to the page number.\npdf_text = [1]  # zero is a placehoder to make page 1 = index 1.

White matter brain connectivity was derived from diffusion-weighted connectome imaging and brain morphology (i.e. cortical thickness and subcortical volume), was extracted from T1-weighted images. We used deep learning, a powerful technique shown to be of great value in many classification problems (Dean et al., 2012; Hinton et al., 2012; Krizhevsky et al., 2012;\nMohamed et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015), with Google's visual search algorithm and Google's AlphaGo program as well-known examples of applications of deep learning (Dean et al., 2012; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Silver et al., 2016).\"\n\n\"Deep learning methods have shown high value in the fields of image classification Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Mohamed et al., 2012) as well as in elucidating complex relationships in MRI data (Plis et al., 2014).\"\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158216301899#t0005"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

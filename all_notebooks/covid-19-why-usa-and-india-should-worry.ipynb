above analysis that China and South Korea can control and tackle COVID-19 efficiently as they have started all their measures early. Their active cases are coming down significantly after the 4th week of initially reported cases.\n\nWhereas Italy and the US are following **Polynomial Regression** curve in Confirmed and Active cases which means in upcoming weeks it's going to increase for sure. There is very little chance of a decline in this curve, especially for the US because there is no complete country lockdown and the US government is only focusing on areas where the number of cases is more.\n\nAlso, there was a significant amount of time between initial cases and sudden surge (close to 7 weeks) but there was no proper measures and actions during this period and I strongly believe this may be the reason behind sudden surge because in absence of lockdown this time frame is sufficient enough to spread the virus.\n\nAs if now, fortunately, this is not happening for India as numbers are still less and if Indians follow 21 days complete lockdown (starting from 24 March till 14th April) rigorously then the situation could be better, hope for the best.\n\n**Thoughts and Prayers with all who are fighting with COVID-19**","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true}}]}

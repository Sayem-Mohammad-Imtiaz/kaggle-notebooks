You have an idea to use customer ratings from Yelp reviews to measure the quality of specific dishes. Assuming that a customer's rating and the menu items mentioned in the review are correlated, items that consistently appear in reviews with low ratings are likely subpar. Using this analysis, you can provide feedback to the owner.\n\nThe goal then is to extract menu items from the review text and find basic statistics on the ratings.

For this you can use `PhraseMatcher` which matches based on phrase patterns. Comparatively `Matcher` matches on tokens, individual words. However, some of the menu items are phrases, so you can't match on individual tokens only. Note that while the menu items are in title case, review authors will often write the food items in a variety of cases. You'll need to tell the `PhraseMatcher` to perform case-insensitive matching with the `attr` keyword argument.\n\nUsing the `nlp` model, create a list of phrase docs from the `menu` list.

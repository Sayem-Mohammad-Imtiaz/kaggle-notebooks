A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was suspected to be the etiology with Phinolophus bat as the alleged origin.\n\nIn absence of specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is essential to detect the diseases at an early stage, and immediately isolate the infected person from the healthy population. According to the latest `guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonitis Caused by 2019-nCoV` (trial sixth version) published by the China government, the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens, as the key indicator for hospitalization. However, with limitations of sample collection and transportation, and kit performance, the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about 30% to 60% at initial presentation . In the current emergency, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that many COVID-19 `patients may not be identified` and may not receive appropriate treatment in time; such patients constitute a risk for infecting a larger population given the highly contagious nature of the virus. `Chest CT, as a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis`, is relatively easy to perform and can produce fast diagnosis. In this context, chest CT may provide benefit for diagnosis of COVID-19. As recently reported, chest CT demonstrates typical radiographic features in almost all COVID-19 patients, including ground-glass 4 opacities, multifocal patchy consolidation, and/or interstitial changes with a peripheral distribution. Those typical features were also observed in patients with negative RT-PCR results but clinical symptoms. It has been noted in small-scale studies that the current RT-PCR testing has limited sensitivity, while chest CT may reveal pulmonary abnormalities consistent with COVID-19 in patients with initial negative RT-PCR results.\nTo better understand the diagnostic value of chest CT compared with RT-PCR testing, they report the results of chest CT in comparison to the initial and serial RT-PCR results in 1014 patients with suspected COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, chest CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Our data and analysis suggest that chest CT should be considered for the COVID-19 screening, comprehensive evaluation, and following-up, especially in epidemic areas with high pre-test probability for disease.\nhttps://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200642"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTpnmOck-xZlKTvUcwp4rywVsgr34amgR_3AVCyLU3w7wRT7I-A',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"youtube.com"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport json\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport cv2\nfrom sklearn import feature_extraction, linear_model, model_selection, preprocessing\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://www.mobihealthnews.com/sites/default/files/SPHCC%20and%20Yitu%20Healthcare%20AI%20software_Mobi.jpg',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#SPHCC and Yitu develop `AI-powered Intelligent Evaluation System` of Chest CT for COVID-19\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19 virus in China, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC) has been actively mobilizing other parties to use the latest tech in the fight against the virus. Through the joint effort of SPHCC and Yitu Healthcare, a Shanghai-based AI startup, the Intelligent Evaluation System of Chest CT for COVID-19 was officially launched on 28 January. \n\nThe system utilizes intelligent diagnosis and quantitative evaluation of CT images of COVID-19 through industry-leading image algorithms, and grades the severity of various pneumonia diseases of local lesions, diffuse lesions, and whole lung involvement. \n\nIn addition, it accurately quantifies the cumulative pneumonia load of the disease through quantitative and omics analysis of key image features such as the morphology, range, and density of the lesion. The system can also render a dynamic 4D contrast of the whole lung lesions on CT, helping in clinical judgment of the condition, evaluation of the efficacy, and prediction of the prognosis. The system can complete a quantitative analysis of lung lesions in 2-3 seconds.\n\nAbove photo: A doctor in SPHCC using the Intelligent Evaluation System of Chest CT for COVID-19 for accurate diagnosis.

This means the focus is not just on health, but on all areas eg, border, economics and gatherings, etc. \n\nLooking after your mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nFor children and young people:\nHave open and honest conversations\nRelay the facts, in a way that is appropriate for their age and temperament. \nListen to their questions.\nLet them know that they are okay and it’s normal to feel concerned.\n\nFor older parents, grandparents or friends:\nCheck in on them and stay in touch.\nHelp them with their physical and medical needs, if they need it, (with consideration to the latest advice from Health authorities)\n\nPlanning for self-isolation:\nMake sure your wider health needs are being looked after such as having enough prescription medicines available to you.\n\nIf you are in self-isolation:\nDevelop a routine that suits you. Think about your needs such as meals, exercise, sleep, medication and how you will organise your day and home to create your new routine. Writing it out can help.\nIf you are well enough, find activities to keep your mind and body stimulated, including getting creative, exercising in your home, or self-care.\nConnect with your friends and family via phone, email or social media\nStay informed with good quality factual information from credible sources (see above) but also switch off and watch favourite TV/films/reading books.\nDon’t be afraid to rely on others to deliver medication, food or essential supplies to you to comply with your self-isolation requirements. Remember that you are helping others and potentially saving lives.\n\nA huge thanks who have shared the initial messaging that got people washing their hands with soap and water often and using cough and sneeze etiquette. Messaging has expanded to include self-isolation, staying home if you’re sick, and being kind to others through this.

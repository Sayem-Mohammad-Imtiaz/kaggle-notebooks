Some Practical examples of NLP are speech recognition for eg: google voice search, understanding what the content is about or sentiment analysis etc.\n\n### NLP Implementations\n\nThese are some of the successful implementations of Natural Language Processing (NLP):\n\n1. Search engines like Google, Yahoo, etc. Google search engine understands that you are a tech guy so it shows you results related to you.\n\n2. Social websites feed like the Facebook news feed. The news feed algorithm understands your interests using natural language processing and shows you related Ads and posts more likely than other posts.\n\n3. Speech engines like Apple Siri.\n\n4. Spam filters like Google spam filters. It’s not just about the usual spam filtering, now spam filters understand what’s inside the email content and see **if it’s a spam or not.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"4vJuWIKpMKWQ","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"G66QHTQ7O28q","outputId":"7e4a5ed8-ac95-4954-c4e2-8035ab2e458e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"messages = pd.read_csv('../input/sms-spam-collection-dataset/spam.csv',encoding='latin1')\nmessages = messages.iloc[:,[0,1]]\nmessages.columns = [\"label\", \"message\"]\nmessages.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"dKmJbv-SMKWT"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# EDA\n\n```\nLet's check out some of the stats with some plots and the built-in methods in pandas!\n```"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"hj6EJ-jdMKWU","outputId":"a6675bf0-1c8b-4fcd-9cd3-a48d30357e26"},"cell_type":"code","source":"messages.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"o51FNCaYMKWX"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n```\nLet's use groupby to use describe by label, this way we can begin to think about the features that separate ham and spam!\n```"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"3dR43Hs7MKWY","outputId":"80dace98-e074-4b38-85f6-d6bca90aaa2f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"messages.groupby('label').describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Rc7NmSJaMKWb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we continue our analysis we want to start thinking about the features we are going to be using.

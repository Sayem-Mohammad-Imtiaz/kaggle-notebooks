The next day, public gatherings of more than four people were banned. And on April 1, karaokes and nightclubs were closed. In the days that followed, bars and beauty parlours were also closed.\n\nHowever, arriving on the back of a nine-month protest movement and rampant cries of police brutality, the authorities stand accused of selectively enforcing the measures. Pro-protest businesses say they are repeatedly targeted, while officials have allegedly turned a blind eye to breaches by pro-government figures.\n\nAre Hong Kong’s social distancing measures being used as an excuse to crack down on the ongoing protest movement? HKFP rounds up key incidents that have caused Hongkongers to question whether enforcement has become politicised.\n\nRegulation 12 also empowers government officers to enter any premises subject to the social distancing measures, conduct examinations, and demand any person for identification. As online commentator Ah Chit wrote, the devil was in the detail.\nhttps://hongkongfp.com/2020/04/17/explainer-after-months-of-protests-is-hong-kong-selectively-enforcing-covid-19-laws/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i1.wp.com/hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0bd57e4a-c070-45ac-9694-382f067a1696-Copy-1.jpg?resize=1050%2C698&ssl=1)https://hongkongfp.com/2020/07/04/we-just-really-fing-love-hong-kong-can-you-criminalise-us/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Soon, high-profile pro-protest “yellow restaurants” complained of being harassed.

Officers demanded the IDs of diners, claiming they suspected some of them were meant to be in mandatory quarantine. The incident was later confirmed by a police spokesperson.\n\nMore recently, dozens of police entered Prince Edward’s Ki Lung Tea Restaurant two evenings in a row on April 11 and 12.

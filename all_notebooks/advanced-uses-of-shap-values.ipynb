SHAP Values: **[Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/shap-values) - [Exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1637226)**\n\n\n# Recap\nWe started by learning about permutation importance and partial dependence plots for an overview of what the model has learned. \n\nWe then learned about SHAP values to break down the components of individual predictions.\n\nNow we'll expand on SHAP values, seeing how aggregating many SHAP values can give more detailed alternatives to permutation importance and partial dependence plots.\n\n# SHAP Values Review\n\nShap values show how much a given feature changed our prediction (compared to if we made that prediction at some baseline value of that feature).\n\nFor example, consider an ultra-simple model:\n    $$y = 4 * x1 + 2 * x2$$\n\nIf $x1$ takes the value 2, instead of a baseline value of 0, then our SHAP value for $x1$ would be 8 (from 4 times 2).\n\nThese are harder to calculate with the sophisticated models we use in practice. But through some algorithmic cleverness, Shap values allow us to decompose any prediction into the sum of effects of each feature value, yielding a graph like this:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/JVD2U7k.png)\n\n[Link to larger view](https://i.imgur.com/JVD2U7k.png)*\n\nIn addition to this nice breakdown for each prediction, the [Shap library](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) offers great visualizations of groups of Shap values. We will focus on two of these visualizations. These visualizations have conceptual similarities to permutation importance and partial dependence plots. So multiple threads from the previous exercises will come together here.\n\n# Summary Plots\n\n[Permutation importance](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/permutation-importance) is great because it created simple numeric measures to see which features mattered to a model. This helped us make comparisons between features easily, and you can present the resulting graphs to non-technical audiences.\n\nBut it doesn't tell you how each features matter. If a feature has medium permutation importance, that could mean it has\n- a large effect for a few predictions, but no effect in general, or\n- a medium effect for all predictions\n\nSHAP summary plots give us a birds-eye view of feature importance and what is driving it. We'll walk through an example plot for the soccer data:\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Ew9X3su.png)\n\nThis plot is made of many dots. Each dot has three characteristics:\n- Vertical location shows what feature it is depicting\n- Color shows whether that feature was high or low for that row of the dataset\n- Horizontal location shows whether the effect of that value caused a higher or lower prediction.\n\nFor example, the point in the upper left was for a team that scored few goals, reducing the prediction by 0.25.\n\nSome things you should be able to easily pick out:\n- The model ignored the `Red` and `Yellow & Red` features. \n- Usually `Yellow Card` doesn't affect the prediction, but there is an extreme case where a high value caused a much lower prediction.\n- High values of Goal scored caused higher predictions, and low values caused low predictions\n\nIf you look for long enough, there's a lot of information in this graph. You'll face some questions to test how you read them in the exercise.\n\n# Summary Plots in Code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe9b3827999f111ddc4324c332361e89b1f8d3db"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You have already seen the code to load the soccer/football data:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f3ebe54d2a4c8fe3f41e292152a15c89873ba7bc","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-2018-match-statistics/FIFA 2018 Statistics.csv')\ny = (data['Man of the Match'] == \"Yes\")  # Convert from string \"Yes\"/\"No\" to binary\nfeature_names = [i for i in data.columns if data[i].dtype in [np.int64, np.int64]]\nX = data[feature_names]\ntrain_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)\nmy_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0).fit(train_X, train_y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"98032125c63257cb850a699ab1ea29a34eaf2ed5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We get the SHAP values for all validation data with the following code.

But there are a few caveats.\n\n- When plotting, we call `shap_values[1]`.  For classification problems, there is a separate array of SHAP values for each possible outcome. In this case, we index in to get the SHAP values for the prediction of \"True\".\n- Calculating SHAP values can be slow. It isn't a problem here, because this dataset is small.  But you'll want to be careful when running these to plot with reasonable sized datasets.  The exception is when using an `xgboost` model, which SHAP has some optimizations for and which is thus much faster.\n\nThis provides a great overview of the model, but we might want to delve into a single feature. That's where SHAP dependence contribution plots come into play.\n\n# SHAP Dependence Contribution Plots\n\nWe've previously used Partial Dependence Plots to show how a single feature impacts predictions. These are insightful and relevant for many real-world use cases. Plus, with a little effort, they can be explained to a non-technical audience.\n\nBut there's a lot they don't show.  For instance, what is the distribution of effects? Is the effect of having a certain value pretty constant, or does it vary a lot depending on the values of other feaures. SHAP dependence contribution plots provide a similar insight to PDP's, but they add a lot more detail.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uQ2JmBm.png)\n\nStart by focusing on the shape, and we'll come back to color in a minute.  Each dot represents a row of the data. The horizontal location is the actual value from the dataset, and the vertical location shows what having that value did to the prediction.  The fact this slopes upward says that the more you possess the ball, the higher the model's prediction is for winning the *Man of the Game* award.\n\nThe spread suggests that other features must interact with Ball Possession %.  For example, here we have highlighted two points with similar ball possession values. That value caused one prediction to increase, and it caused the other prediction to decrease.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tFzp6jc.png)\n\nFor comparison, a simple linear regression would produce plots that are perfect lines, without this spread.\n\nThis suggests we delve into the interactions, and the plots include color coding to help do that. While the primary trend is upward, you can visually inspect whether that varies by dot color. \n\nConsider the following very narrow example for concreteness.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NVB3eNW.png)\n\nThese two points stand out spatially as being far away from the upward trend. They are both colored purple, indicating the team scored one goal. You can interpret this to say **In general, having the ball increases a team's chance of having their player win the award. But if they only score one goal, that trend reverses and the award judges may penalize them for having the ball so much if they score that little.**\n\nOutside of those few outliers, the interaction indicated by color isn't very dramatic here. But sometimes it will jump out at you.\n\n# Dependence Contribution Plots in Code\nWe get the dependence contribution plot with the following code. The only line that's different from the `summary_plot` is the last line."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9f309c21ff3d7142f351c6774ead459a9e1fd55","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import shap  # package used to calculate Shap values\n\n# Create object that can calculate shap values\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(my_model)\n\n# calculate shap values.

The question then becomes what year of used car should you purchase to gain the most value?\n- The fast depreciating rate of a new vehicle is very apparent in the first graph. Cars that are brand new depreciated more than 30% in one year, around 15% for cars that are 1 year old, then reaches to an almost 0% yearly depreciation rate for cars that are 2 years old. \n- This yearly depreciation rate is unseen for cars that are between 0-12 years old. It's also interested that we see a positive appreciation rate for cars that are between 13 and 14 years old, this could be due to the desire for antique vehicles\n- In conclusion, buying a 2 years old car seems to be a good choice. If the purchaser doesn not care for modern technology and style of a brand new car then purchasing a car that is around 6 years old is also a good idea.","metadata":{}}]}

Machine learning is finally an algorithm and like all algorithms if you put garbage in you will get garbage out. Hence the data processing that is required. We have to first take care of features which reflects various categories. In this particular example it is the level of salary and the description of job. We will use first use the LabelEncoder from scikit learn in order to give them a integer based code. However we cannot use the integers as input for our neural network as the integers will carry weights and ideally we would like those specific categories to be equally weighted by the neural network. Thus we will use the OneHotEncoder again from scikit learn in order to binarize the categories. We will then split the data into training and test set so that we can evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm.

As a novice, this makes them easy to pick up and use. However, pandas has its own accessor operators, loc and iloc. For more advanced operations, these are the ones you're supposed to be using.\n\nIndex-based selection\nPandas indexing works in one of two paradigms. The first is index-based selection: selecting data based on its numerical position in the data. iloc follows this paradigm.\n\nTo select the first row of data in a DataFrame, we may use the following:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"wine_reviews.iloc[0]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Both loc and iloc are row-first, column-second.

So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,9. loc, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So 0:10 will select entries 0,...,10.\n\nWhy the change? Remember that loc can index any stdlib type: strings, for example. If we have a DataFrame with index values Apples, ..., Potatoes, ..., and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes'] than it is to index something like df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet] (t coming after s in the alphabet).\n\nThis is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. 0,...,1000. In this case df.iloc[0:1000] will return 1000 entries, while df.loc[0:1000] return 1001 of them!

This suggests that there is a substantial difference between the lifetime smoking rates for women and men. However there is no explicit information here about how different the two population proportions might be. To address this question, we can form a confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of females who smoke and the proportion of males who smoke. \n\nThe point estimate of the difference between female and male smoking rates is -0.208 (0.305 - 0.513). That is, the smoking rate is about 20 percentage points higher in men than in women. This difference of around 20 percentage points is only a point estimate of the underlying true value -- it is not exactly equal to the difference between the unknown proportions of females and males who smoke in the population. A confidence interval helps us assess how far the estimated difference may be from the true difference.\nAs above, we start with the standard error. The difference between two sample proportions based on independent data has a standard error that reflects the combined uncertainty in the two proportions being differenced. This standard error can be calculated very easily. If SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors for two proportions, then sqrt(SE1^2 + SE2^2) is the standard error for the difference of these proportions (sqrt is the square root function).

First note that the proportion discussed above is also a mean -- for example, if the data are 0, 1, 0, then the mean is 1/3, which is also the proportion of 1's in the data. However the proportion has the special property that the variance is completely determined by the mean. That is why we constructed the standard errors for the sample proportion above using p•(1 - p) as the variance. In general, the variance of quantitative data will not be a function of the mean, as this is a very special property of binary data. Therefore, in general we must estimate the variance as a separate step after estimating the mean. \nTo illustrate the construction of confidence intervals for the population mean of a quantitative variable, we will use the body mass inde (BMI) data from NHANES.

The reason for this is that even though the NHANES sample size for women is slightly larger than that for men, the data for women appears to be more spread out.

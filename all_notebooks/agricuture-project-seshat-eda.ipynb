Prior to the development of plant cultivation, human beings were hunters and gatherers.🪓 The knowledge and skill of learning to care for the soil and growth of plants advanced the development of human society, allowing clans and tribes to stay in one location generation after generation. \n\nArchaeological evidence indicates that such developments occurred 10,000 or more years ago. 🌾🌽\n\n\n<h1 style = \"font-family: Comic Sans MS;background-color:#FFC305\"> A brief introduction about the dataset </h1>\n\nBefore actually starting to learn about the dataset, we should first try to understand the organization and its purpose for \n\n**About Seshat**\n\nSeshat: \nGlobal History Databank is an international scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute. Founded in 2011, the Seshat: Global History Databank gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses. The Databank consults directly with expert scholars to code what historical societies and their environments were like in the form of accessible datapoints and thus forms a digital storehouse for data on the political and social organization of all human groups from the early modern back to the ancient and neolithic periods.\n\nGlobal History Databank is governed by the Board of Directors, who are advised by a number of subject matter consultants. Data collection for a specific NGA is coordinated by a Regional Editor, and data entered for a specific polity has been gathered in consultation with expert historians and archaeologists but is continually updated via ongoing expert review. The hands-on work of populating the databank is accomplished by the project’s Research Assistants and Postdoctoral Research Associates. \n\n\n**About the Project: Agricultural Productivity and Carrying Capacity**\n\nAgricultural productivity and its variation across time and space plays a fundamental role in many theories of human social and cultural evolution. Because agricultural societies enjoy a demographic advantage over hunter-gatherer societies, the transition from foraging to agriculture fueled a series of population expansions world-wide, which spread the farmers’ culture, language, and genes with them. However, although the Neolithic Revolution was one of the most consequential transitions in human evolution, we lack systematically collected quantitative estimates of the productivity of past agricultural systems on a large enough scale.\n\n![Alt Text](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/e8/a0/60/e8a06059b8cf49d04a8ec3df85cc3534.jpg)\n\nIn particular, by how much did adoption of agriculture increase human carrying capacity, the maximum population density a particular environment can sustain indefinitely, without depleting critical resources needed for survival and reproduction? Even more importantly, how did agricultural productivity /carrying capacity vary over time (as new technologies were invented and spread, and as a result of climate change) and in space (between geographic regions characterized by different soils, landscapes, and climate)? Seshat: Global History Databank is exploring various techniques to combine estimations of historical ecology, corp types and yields, and farming practices along with simulations of changing weather patterns to produce reliable, empirically-grounded estimates of productivity and carrying capacity in different parts of the world through time.\n\nIt's becoming too boring, isn't it?

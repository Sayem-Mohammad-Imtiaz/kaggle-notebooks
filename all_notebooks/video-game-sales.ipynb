When I started this final project I thought it was going to be extremely difficult or time consuming, but it really wasnt. I had learned a lot from this project and I still plan to find out more with data analysis on Kaggle. \n    As I started the beginning process I didn't know what data to use so I just went with something that inerests me and I decided to use Video Game Sales. It was interesting to see so much data that someone had compiled for so long and put it all into one spreadsheet. Data is a really interesting subject to talk about and could take hours to analize it but know I could use kaggle to do it for me. \n    The best part about Kaggle is that you dont have to use their datasets. You can use one of your own that you have made and start analyzing it in Kaggle, but it is a different set of skills and processes. Analyzing my own data will be amazing because there is so much to keep track of. I will definitely keep using this and trying to find better ways to analyze but for now this is amazing.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

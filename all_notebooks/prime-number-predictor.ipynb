This was a lot of fun to write, and I look forward to expanding the complexity of my future projects.\n\nUnfortunately, the models output by this code are about 500x larger than their training files (e.g. the 100k dataset is 1.6MB, and the model that trained on it is about 730MB), so there's no reason to use an AI for this instead of a simple program that loads primes from a CSV.

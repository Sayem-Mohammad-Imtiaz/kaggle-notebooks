It is not required to do normalization everytime, it is only required when numerical features have a significant difference in terms of ranges </p> \n\n<p> For example, take age and income. Age ranges from 1-100 usually and income usually ranges from 0-50,000 and higher. Income is significantly larger than age and when we do further analysis like multivariate linear regression, income influences the result more than the age feature due it its higher value. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that income is more important than age as a predictor. In order to see the effects of normalization, let's create 2 Neural networks, where we do normalization for one and not for the other. </p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> Unnormalized </h1> "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Split data into train and test \nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y , train_size = 0.7, random_state =  90)\n\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=tf.nn.relu,                  \n input_shape=(x_train.shape[1],)),\n keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=tf.nn.relu),\n keras.layers.Dense(8, activation=  'softmax')\n ])\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer=tf.train.AdamOptimizer(),\n              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\nhistory1 = model.fit(\n x_train, y_train,\n epochs= 26, batch_size = 60,\n validation_data = (x_test, y_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p> As you can see, accuracy is low and is unchanging per epoch, now let's try using normalized data</p>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn import preprocessing\n\n\n#Select numerical columns which needs to be normalized\ntrain_norm = x_train[x_train.columns[0:10]]\ntest_norm = x_test[x_test.columns[0:10]]\n\n# Normalize Training Data \nstd_scale = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(train_norm)\nx_train_norm = std_scale.transform(train_norm)\n\n#Converting numpy array to dataframe\ntraining_norm_col = pd.DataFrame(x_train_norm, index=train_norm.index, columns=train_norm.columns) \nx_train.update(training_norm_col)\nprint (x_train.head())\n\n# Normalize Testing Data by using mean and SD of training set\nx_test_norm = std_scale.transform(test_norm)\ntesting_norm_col = pd.DataFrame(x_test_norm, index=test_norm.index, columns=test_norm.columns) \nx_test.update(testing_norm_col)\nprint (x_test.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"history2 = model.fit(\n x_train, y_train,\n epochs= 26, batch_size = 60,\n validation_data = (x_test, y_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p> Accuracy has improved significantly and the model now learns per epoch, which is better compared to before </p>\n <h1> Explanation </h1>\n<p>   The model with the unnormalized data didn't learn in 26 epochs because different features do not have similar ranges of values, as a result, gradients oscillate back and forth and take a long time before it can finally find its way to the global/local minimum.

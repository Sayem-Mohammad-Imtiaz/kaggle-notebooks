Link between neural network and logistic regression\nWhen we hear or read about deep learning we generally mean the sub-field of machine learning using artificial neural networks (ANN). These computing systems are quite successful in solving complex problems in various fields, examples are, image recognition, language modelling, and speech recognition. While the name ANN implies that they are related to the inner workings of our brain, the truth is that they mainly share some terminology. An ANN generally consists of multiple interconnected layers, which on itself are build using neurons (also called nodes). An example is shown in figure 1.\n\n![Neural Network](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/Tutorials/raw/master/Neural_Network/assets/NeuralNetwork.png)\n*Figure 1: Example of a typical neural network, borrowed from my follow up article on neural networks.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this example, we have one input layer, consisting of four individual inputs nodes. This input layer is ‘fully connected’ to the first hidden layer, i.e. Fully connected means that each input is connected to each node. The first hidden layer is again fully connected to another ‘hidden’ layer. The term hidden indicates that we are not directly interact with these layers and these are kind of obscured to the user. The second hidden layer is on its turn fully connected two the final output layer, which consists of two nodes. So in this example we feed the model four inputs and we will receive two outputs.\n\nLet’s now focus on a single neuron from our previous example. This neuron still is connected to all inputs, also called features. Using these features, the neuron calculates a single response (or output). A diagram of such a system is depicted in figure 2.\n\n![Logistic unit](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/Tutorials/raw/master/Logistic_Regression/assets/logisticunit.png)\n*Figure 2: single neuron with four input features. The neuron has two operations: a linear part and the activation function.*\n\nThe input features are named 𝑓¹, 𝑓², 𝑓³, and 𝑓⁴ and are all connected to the single neuron. This neuron executes two operations. The first operation is a multiplication of the features with a weight vector 𝑊 and adding the bias term 𝑏. The second operation is a so called activation function, indicated here by 𝜎. The output of the neuron is a probability between zero and one. The single neuron acts like a small logistic regression model and therefore, an ANN can be seen as a bunch of interconnected logistic regression models stacked together. While this idea is pretty neat, the underlying truth is a bit more subtle. There are many different architectures for ANNs and they can use various building blocks that act quite different than in this example.\n\nThe linear operation in our single neuron is nothing more than a linear regression. Therefore, to understand logistic regression, the first step is to have an idea how linear regression works. The next section will show a step by step example as a recap."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.1 One step back: linear regression\n## a) What is a linear regression again?\nLinear regression in its simplest form (also called simple linear regression), models a single dependent variable 𝑦 using a single independent variable 𝑥. This may sound daunting, but was this means is that we want to solve the following equation:\n```\n𝑦 = a𝑥 + 𝑏\n```\n\nIn the context of machine learning, 𝑥 represents our input data, 𝑦 represents our output data, and by solving we mean to find the best weights (or parameters), represented by 𝑤 and 𝑏 in the linear regression equation. A computer can help us find the best values for 𝑤 and 𝑏, to have the closest match for 𝑦 using the input variable 𝑥.\n\nFor the next examples, let us define the following values for x and y:\n```\n𝑥 = [−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4,5]\n𝑦 = [−3,−1,1,3,5,7,9,11]\n```\n\nThe values for 𝑥 and 𝑦 have a linear relation so we can use linear regression to find (or fit) the best weights and solve the problem. Maybe, by staring long enough at these values, we can discover the relation, however it is much easier to use a computer to find the answer.\n\nIf you have stared long enough or just want to know the answer, the relation between 𝑥 and 𝑦 is the following:\n```\n𝑦 = 2𝑥 + 1\n```\n\nIn the next section we will use Tensorflow to create our single neuron model and try to ‘solve’ the equation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## b) An implementation in Tensorflow\n\nBefore we start with Tensorflow, we should first organize our input data (𝑥) and output data (𝑦).

This is only necessary for the first layer.\n\nNow that we have defined the model, we need to use the Compile() method to configure the model for training. The method requires at least two parameters, a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function is a measure for how well the model predicts the actual value. For this example we will use the mean squared error (average of the squared difference between the predicted and the actual value of 𝑦). The ‘learning algorithm’ will try to minimize the loss my adjusting (optimizing) the parameters (weights and bias) for each step.

There are two differences from the previous code we created. First, our linear regression model only had a single feature, which we inputted with $x$, meaning that we only had a single weight. In logistic regression, you generally input more than one feature, and each will have its own weight. This will change the previous simple multiplication to a matrix multiplication (dot product). Secondly, we will add a so called *activation function* to map this value between 0 or 1. Let's remind ourselves again of our simple model:\n![Logistic unit](https://github.com/dennisbakhuis/Tutorials/raw/master/Logistic_Regression/assets/logisticunit.png)\n\nBy convention (from what I have understood) in Tensorflow, the input vector has columns for features, and rows for examples. If we would have 2 datapoints the input matrix would look like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nf^1_1 & f^2_1 & f^3_1 & f^4_1 \\\\\nf^1_2 & f^2_2 & f^3_2 & f^4_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nThe superscript shows the feature number, the subscript indicates the example.\n\nEach of these inputs are associated with their own weights. The node itself has two explict operations. The first is the dot product between the weights vector and the input vector. The second is the sigmoid funtion. The weight vector $W$ in this example has four weights:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nX = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 \\\\\nW^2 \\\\\nW^3 \\\\\nW^4\n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nIn the node we first compute the linear part:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nZ = W X + b\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor our example this will look like this:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nZ = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 \\\\\nW^2 \\\\\nW^3 \\\\\nW^4\n\\end{matrix} \\right) \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nf^1_1 & f^2_1 & f^3_1 & f^4_1 \\\\\nf^1_2 & f^2_2 & f^3_2 & f^4_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right) + b = \\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\nW^1 f^1_1 + W^2 f^2_1 + W^3 f^3_1 + W^4 f^4_1 + b\\\\\nW^1 f^1_1 + W^2 f^2_1 + W^3 f^3_1 + W^4 f^4_1 + b\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right) = \\left( \n\\begin{matrix}\nz_1 \\\\\nz_2 \n\\end{matrix} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nNotice that the result is only a single value for each example.\n\nFor all values of $x$, which can be from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ (all real numbers), the sigmoid function maps $x$ between 0 and 1. Only values for $x$ close to zero matter, as these are in the 'linear regime'. Very large, or very small are only clipped to 1 and 0 respectively. The mathematical definition of the sigmoid is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nA = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-Z}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is all there is to the logistic unit. The sigmoid function gives the node its non-linear character. Many of these units together can do almost magical things.

Learning how and when shoppers will research and purchase goods online is important to businesses as they can use customer behavior insights to target advertising, marketing, and deals to potential customers to further increase their sales and revenue. \n\n\n\n\n![ShoppingImage](https://images.pexels.com/photos/749353/pexels-photo-749353.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=paper-bags-near-wall-749353.jpg&fm=jpg =250x150)\n\n\n**The Data:**\n[Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#)<br>\nThe data set is a set of 18 features: 10 numerical and 8 categorical.

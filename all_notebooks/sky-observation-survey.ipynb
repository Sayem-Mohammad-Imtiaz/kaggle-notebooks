Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.\n\nFeature Description\nThe table results from a query which joins two tables (actuaclly views): \"PhotoObj\" which contains photometric data and \"SpecObj\" which contains spectral data.\n\nTo ease your start with the data you can read the feature descriptions below:\n\nView \"PhotoObj\"\nobjid = Object Identifier\nra = J2000 Right Ascension (r-band)\ndec = J2000 Declination (r-band)\nRight ascension (abbreviated RA) is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the hour circle of the point above the earth in question. When paired with declination (abbreviated dec), these astronomical coordinates specify the direction of a point on the celestial sphere (traditionally called in English the skies or the sky) in the equatorial coordinate system.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension\n\nu = better of DeV/Exp magnitude fit\ng = better of DeV/Exp magnitude fit\nr = better of DeV/Exp magnitude fit\ni = better of DeV/Exp magnitude fit\nz = better of DeV/Exp magnitude fit\nThe Thuan-Gunn astronomic magnitude system. u, g, r, i, z represent the response of the 5 bands of the telescope.\n\nFurther education: https://www.astro.umd.edu/~ssm/ASTR620/mags.html\n\nrun = Run Number\nrereun = Rerun Number\ncamcol = Camera column\nfield = Field number\nRun, rerun, camcol and field are features which describe a field within an image taken by the SDSS. A field is basically a part of the entire image corresponding to 2048 by 1489 pixels. A field can be identified by: - run number, which identifies the specific scan, - the camera column, or \"camcol,\" a number from 1 to 6, identifying the scanline within the run, and - the field number. The field number typically starts at 11 (after an initial rampup time), and can be as large as 800 for particularly long runs. - An additional number, rerun, specifies how the image was processed.\n\nView \"SpecObj\"\nspecobjid = Object Identifier\nclass = object class (galaxy, star or quasar object)\nThe class identifies an object to be either a galaxy, star or quasar. This will be the response variable which we will be trying to predict.\n\nredshift = Final Redshift\nplate = plate number\nmjd = MJD of observation\nfiberid = fiber ID\nIn physics, redshift happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum.\n\nEach spectroscopic exposure employs a large, thin, circular metal plate that positions optical fibers via holes drilled at the locations of the images in the telescope focal plane. These fibers then feed into the spectrographs. Each plate has a unique serial number, which is called plate in views such as SpecObj in the CAS.\n\nModified Julian Date, used to indicate the date that a given piece of SDSS data (image or spectrum) was taken.\n\nThe SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light at the focal plane from individual objects to the slithead. Each object is assigned a corresponding fiberID.\n\nFurther information on SDSS images and their attributes:\n\nhttp://www.sdss3.org/dr9/imaging/imaging_basics.php\n\nhttp://www.sdss3.org/dr8/glossary.php\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe data released by the SDSS is under public domain. Its taken from the current data release RD14.\n\nMore information about the license:\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/science/image-gallery/\n\nIt was acquired by querying the CasJobs database which contains all data published by the SDSS.\n\nThe exact query can be found at:\n\nhttp://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs/ (Free account is required!)\n\nThere are also other ways to get data from the SDSS catalogue. They can be found under:\n\nhttp://www.sdss.org/dr14/\n\nThey really have a huge database which offers the possibility of creating all kinds of tables with respect to personal interests.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contact me regarding any questions or improvement suggestions. :-)\n\nInspiration\nThe dataset offers plenty of information about space to explore. Also the class column is the perfect target for classification practices!\n\nNote: Since the data was already maintained very well it might not be best dataset to practice data cleaning / filtering...your decision though."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5453fa373dd5e6e96c298f1408ba5d99ebd08896"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here I will build a random forest learning method to solve this problem.

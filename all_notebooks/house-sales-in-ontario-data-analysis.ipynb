They are obtained for a short period of time in July 2016 and include the following fields: - Price in dollars - Address of the property - Latitude and Longitude of the address obtained by using Google Geocoding service - Area Name of the property obtained by using Google Geocoding service\nThis dataset will provide a good starting point for analyzing the inflated housing market in Canada although it does not include time related information. Initially, it is intended to draw an enhanced interactive heatmap of the house prices for different neighborhoods (areas)\nHowever, if there is enough interest, there will be more information added as newer versions to this dataset. Some of those information will include more details on the property as well as time related information on the price (changes).\nThis is a somehow related articles about the real estate prices in Ontario: http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/check-out-this-heat-map-of-toronto-real-estate-prices/\nI am also inspired by this dataset which was provided for King County https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction \"\nTasks and questions:\nWhich region have more qtt of houses on sale?\nWhich region have more valuable houses?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"#Importing Data Analysis Libs\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"#Getting Data\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/properties.csv')","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Checking Dataset\ndf.head(5)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3},{"metadata":{},"source":"df.columns","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Changing some Column Names\ndf.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'ID', 'Price ($)': 'Price'}, inplace=True)\ndf.columns","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5},{"metadata":{},"source":"df.shape","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6},{"metadata":{},"source":"df.describe()","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Eliminating houses with invalid lat and lng\ndf2 = df[(df['lat'] != -999 ) & (df['lng'] != -999)]\ndf2.shape","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Eliminating houses with price <= 100000 and >= 10000000\ndf3 = df2[(df2['Price'] >= 100000) & (df2['Price'] <= 10000000)]\ndf3.shape","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9},{"metadata":{},"source":"df3.describe()","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Which area have more quantity of houses on sale?"},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Creating a TOP 20 Rank by area\nqtHouses = pd.DataFrame(df3['AreaName'].value_counts())\nqtHouses.sort_values(by='AreaName')\nqtHouses[0:20].plot(kind='bar', title='Top 20 Areas by Number of Houses on Sale')","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Downtown is the area with most number of houses on sale"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Which area have the most expensive houses on sale ?"},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Boxplot \ntopAreasNames = list(qtHouses[0:20].index)\narea = df3[df3['AreaName'].isin(topAreasNames)]\n#print(topAreasNames)\nbox_ax = area.boxplot(column='Price', by='AreaName', rot=90, grid=True)\nbox_ax.set_ylim(-1e5, 4e6)\n\nplt.show()","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12},{"metadata":{},"source":"#Mean Price by Area(Top 20)\ndf3_dropped = df3.drop(['ID','Address','lat','lng'], axis=1)\nmeanPrices = df3_dropped.groupby(['AreaName']).mean().sort_values(by='Price', axis=0, ascending=False)\ntopMeanPrices = meanPrices[0:20] \ntopMeanPrices.plot(kind='bar', title='Top 20 Mean Prices of Houses by Area')","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13}],"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4}

Selecting subsets of research papers\nThere are a few ways to select from the research papers. Firstly, you can use the query function\n\n## Query\nThe query function follows the same pattern as the DataFrame query function - in fact it delegates to the metadata dataframe's query function, makes a copy of the metadata and creates a new ResearchPaper instance.

To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 \nintroductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early \nreported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, \nwe show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic \nimportation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.\n\"\"\"\nresearch_papers.search_2d(query)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

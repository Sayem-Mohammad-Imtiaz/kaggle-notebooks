Here, we have got a dataset which contains list of websites, their kind and text extract from them.\n\nHere, we would be using `Natural Language Processing(NLP)` techniques to develop out dataset and then create a Naive Bayes model based on it to classify websites.\n\n\n## Methodology\n\n1. Data exploring and understanding: This step involves preliminary level data understanding and exploring.\n\n2. Data Cleaning: This step includes cleaning the existing data. We check the data for any missing values and treat them as per the requirements. We also need to look for constant value columns as that is not going to add any additional value to out analysis. Sometimes columns with very high proportion of any particular value also doesn't add any values. Hence, getting rid of them helps with further analysis.\n\n3. Data Preparation: This step is mainly useful for feeding in the data into the model. It involves steps like creating dummy variables, scaling etc. depending upon the data type.  Here, we would be using `NLP` techniques to develop our dataset which can be fed to model.\n\n4. Data Visualization: This step involves visualizing our dataset and check for relationship amongst independent variables. We can also reduce some feature columns here but it should not be aggressive.\n\n5. Train-test split: This step involves splitting the dataset into train and test parts.\n\n6. Model Development-validation and evaluation: This steps involves training the model and validate it. It involves evaluating the model using relevant metrics.\n\n7. Conclusion/Recommendation: It involves drawing conclusions and recommendations to business.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing Dependencies","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\nimport nltk\n#nltk.download()\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os \nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames: \n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\ndata.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Dataset is having 4 columns including target variable `Category`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Out of that array we would filter out english language stop_words which generally doesn't give any meaningful insight about the document.

For assigning feature value, we would use `TF-IFD` method.\n\n`TF-IDF:` TF-IDF is a method of comparing how relevant a word is to any particular document (here website) from a given bunch of documents. \n\n$TF-IDF = TF(t,d)*IDF(t,D)$\n\nwhere, \n\nTF(t,d) = (count of t in d)/(number of words in d)\n\n$IDF(t,D) = log(D/(df + 1))$\n\n$t$--> term of interest\n\n$d$ --> document of interest\n\n$D$ --> Set of documents\n\n$df$ --> occurrence of t in documents\n\nTo summarize, TF-IDF score of any feature for any particular document would be high if that feature term occurs rarely in other documents and/or percentage occurrence for that term in the given document is higher.\n\n\nAdditional Reading Source: \nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/tf-idf-for-document-ranking-from-scratch-in-python-on-real-world-dataset-796d339a4089","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before developing TF-IDF based array we need to filter out words with `Parts Of Speech (POS)` other than `NOUN`.

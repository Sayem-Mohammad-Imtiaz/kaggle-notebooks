Decision tree models are even simpler to interpret than linear regression!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion and potential improvements\n\nAdditional features you might want to research to explain the increase of bikes in 2019 : \n- new city cycling incentives \n- new companies policies \n- improved cycling infrastrucure\n\nIn addition, another predicive method would be interesting to try out : Time series analysis. This method is good to spot seasonality and overall trend but hard to understand the actual cause (like enhanced bike lanes, etc). \n\nAnother more advanced improvement of our model training would be not to shuffle our training data as we have a time component in our data. Indeed we are here randomly predicting traffic on past dates, whereas it would make more sense to train our model on 2015 to 2018 and predict 2019/2020 figures for instance.  \nTo do this : train_test_split with (shuffle=False) see full documentation here https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python [conda env:.conda-training-celia]","language":"python","name":"conda-env-.conda-training-celia-py"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Commonly (though not in this article), each of the possible values of a categorical variable is referred to as a level. The probability distribution associated with a random categorical variable is called a categorical distribution.\n\nCategorical data is the statistical data type consisting of categorical variables or of data that has been converted into that form, for example as grouped data. More specifically, categorical data may derive from observations made of qualitative data that are summarised as counts or cross tabulations, or from observations of quantitative data grouped within given intervals. Often, purely categorical data are summarised in the form of a contingency table. However, particularly when considering data analysis, it is common to use the term \"categorical data\" to apply to data sets that, while containing some categorical variables, may also contain non-categorical variables.\n\n#### Categorical Values we have\n\n\nColoum Name | DateTime |\n--- | --- |\nprice        | Int |\nbedrooms     | Int |\nbathrooms    | Int |\nsqft_living  | Int |\nsqft_lot     | Int |\nfloors       | Int |\nwaterfront   | Int |\nview         | Categorical |\ncondition    | Int |\nsqft_above   | Int |\nsqft_basement| Int |\nyr_built     | Categorical |\nyr_renovated | Categorical |\nstreet       | Categorical | \ncity         | Categorical |\nstatezip     | Categorical |\ncountry      | Categorical |\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n1.

We can also convert vectors to scalar by just flattening but that will not be a good idea becuase when we flatten a vector it becomes [1,1,2,3,2] means convert them into more columns. So a good idea is to reduce a vector to scalar. We will do some matrix maliplication for this\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Why do we need to standardize our data?\n\n        Standardization comes into picture when features of input data set have large differences between their ranges, or simply when they are measured in different measurement units (e.g., Pounds, Meters, Miles … etc).\n\n        These differences in the ranges of initial features causes trouble to many machine learning models. For example, for the models that are based on distance computation, if one of the features has a broad range of values, the distance will be governed by this particular feature.\n\n        To illustrate this with an example : say we have a 2-dimensional data set with two features, Height in Meters and Weight in Pounds, that range respectively from [1 to 2] Meters and [10 to 200] Pounds. No matter what distance based model you perform on this data set, the Weight feature will dominate over the Height feature and will have more contribution to the distance computation, just because it has bigger values compared to the Height. So, to prevent this problem, transforming features to comparable scales using standardization is the solution.\n\nGet More Insights from here [Click Here Please](https://builtin.com/data-science/when-and-why-standardize-your-data)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X = df.drop('price', axis = 1).to_numpy()\nY = df['price'].to_numpy()\n\n# Shapes Of Our Dataset\nprint(X.shape)\nprint(Y.shape)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T17:08:38.074594Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T17:08:38.075045Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T17:08:38.085049Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T17:08:38.075006Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T17:08:38.08371Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nscaler.fit(X)\nX = scaler.transform(X)\n\n# Oh!

Change Activation of last layer from sigmoid to tanh (2 units improvement)\n3. Reduce Layers\n4. Increase Number of epochs\n5. Change huber loss to mae\n\n### Lets check the loss fucntion now\n\nThere are 3 types of loss that we mostly use in regression problem\n\n1. Mean Squared Error\n2. Mean Absolute Error\n3. Huber Loss\n\n\n#### Mean Squared Error\nMean Square error is the square of **Actual - Prediction** and than divided by total number of points. So as we are squaring the number means the larger value have larger impact becaused it is been sqaured than than processed. Get So? So we used this error when Larger values are more significant than smaller values. This error is also known as L2 error and more sensitive to the outliers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![mean square error](https://github.com/SohaibAnwaar/tensorflow-basics/blob/main/extras/mean_squared_error.svg?raw=true)\n \n* MSE\t=\tmean squared error\n* n\t=\tnumber of data points\n* Y\t=\tobserved values\n* ÿ   =\tpredicted values\n\n\n### Mean Absolute Error\nMean absolute error Subtract Predicted value from the actual value (Make it positive if it's negative) than divide it by the total number of points we have. We use it when small error as well as large errors equally important for us. Like in House prediction problem we dont really care about cents but about dollars So Larger error are important for us. I hope you get it now. MAE is also known as L1 loss and robust to Outliers.\n\n![Mean Absolute error](https://github.com/SohaibAnwaar/tensorflow-basics/blob/main/extras/mean_absolute_error.svg?raw=true)\n\n* MAE\t=\tmean absolute error\n* n\t=\tnumber of data points\n* Y\t=\tobserved values\n* x   =\tpredicted values\n\n### Huber Loss\nHuber loss is the combination of Mean Asbolute error and Mean Squared error. Huber loss is less sensitive to outliers in data than the squared error loss. It’s also differentiable at 0. It’s basically absolute error, which becomes quadratic when error is small. How small that error has to be to make it quadratic depends on a hyperparameter, 𝛿 (delta), which can be tuned. Huber loss approaches MSE when 𝛿 ~ 0 and MAE when 𝛿 ~ ∞ (large numbers.) \n\n![Huber Loss](https://github.com/SohaibAnwaar/tensorflow-basics/blob/main/extras//huber.png?raw=true)\n\n\n* n\t=\tnumber of data points\n* Y\t=\tobserved values\n* x   =\tpredicted values\n* 𝛿  = is Hyperparameter which is decided by the user according to the problem","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training\nmodel2 = tf.keras.Sequential()\nmodel2.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(40, activation = \"relu\"))\nmodel2.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation = \"tanh\"))\nmodel2.compile(loss = tf.keras.losses.mae, optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr = 0.01), metrics = \"mae\")\n\nhistory = model2.fit(X, Y, epochs = 300, validation_split = 0.1, verbose = 0)\nplot_loss(history)\n\npredict_model2 = model2.predict(X_test).flatten()\nmodel2.evaluate(X_test, Y_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T17:09:04.07925Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T17:09:04.079506Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.133368Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T17:09:04.07948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.132623Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Model Performace Graphs","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nindex = np.asarray([i for i in range(len(Y_test))])\n\n# Create traces\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=predict_model1, x= index,\n                    mode='lines',\n                    name='SGD_Optimizer (MODEL 1)'))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=predict_model2, x= index,\n                    mode='lines',\n                    name='Adam_Optimizer (MODEL 2)'))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(y=Y, x=index,\n                    mode='lines',\n                    name='Actual'))\n\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title=\"Model Performance\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Index\",\n    yaxis_title=\"House Price Prediction\",\n\n)\n\nfig.show() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.134722Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.135067Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.323799Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.13503Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T17:10:03.323065Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

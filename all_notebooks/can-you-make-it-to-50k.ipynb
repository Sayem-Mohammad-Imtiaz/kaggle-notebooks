Obtain: the data must be obtained before any other activities can be conducted\n2. Scrubbing: the next step is to clean, format and/or re-arrange the data for easier analysis and model training\n3. Exploring: exploration of the whole dataset using descriptive statistics and visualisations. The task is to find any statistical significance that exists and do hypothesis testing (1-t test or relational testing). Based on the newly gained information, we will conduct feature extraction to determine which variables are suitable for our logistic model.\n4. Modeling: the data will be split into training set and test set. We will feed the training set into the model and later feed the test set to see how our model performs. A feature selection process using DecisionTree can further improve our accuracy by providing a more significant variables\n5.

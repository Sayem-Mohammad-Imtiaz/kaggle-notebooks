business is completely depends on discounts for its sales.Most sold prodcut types are 'art and sculpture','Basket' as subsiquent amounts of discounts are given to increase their sales\n#2: but the 2 and 3 most demanded products are in 'Jewelry' and 'Kitchen' but discounts given to these products are relatively less they can increase discount and increase the sales\n#3: as we cannot give discount to 'Jewelry' the next most sold products to focus are christmas and home decor\n#4: the next solution is we can lower a little bit of amount of discount given to The most sold products subsequently sales will decrease but will increase profitability and we should increase a little bit of discount in kitchen products to increase their sales\n#4 conti(option):or we can keep the same discount in the most sold products and increase a little amount of discount in kitchen products\n#5 this will increase sales in 3 products

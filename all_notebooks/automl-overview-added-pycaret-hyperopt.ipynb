AutoML essentially focuses on two major aspects — data acquisition/collection and prediction. All the other steps that take place in between can be easily automated while delivering a model that’s optimized well and ready to make predictions.\n\nThe success of machine learning in a wide range of applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine learning systems that can be used off the shelf by non-experts¹. AutoML tends to automate the maximum number of steps in an ML pipeline—with a minimum amount of human effort and without compromising the model’s performance.\n\n\n### Advantages\n\n#### The advantages of AutoML can be summed up in three major points:\n\n    - Increases productivity by automating repetitive tasks. This enables a data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\n\n    - Automating the ML pipeline also helps to avoid errors that might creep in manually.\n\n    - Ultimately, AutoML is a step towards democratizing machine learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020572,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:16.78312","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:16.762548","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Let us begin to look at the various frameworks, along with code."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:16.832441Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:16.831593Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:17.951682Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:17.952367Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.148793,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:17.952583","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:16.80379","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split        ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.002946Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.002104Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.037239Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.036466Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.062528,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.037373","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:17.974845","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.098979Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.098031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.101453Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.100855Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.042212,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.101588","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.059376","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = df.target.values\nx_data = df.drop(['target'], axis = 1)\n\n# Normalize\n#x = (x_data - np.min(x_data)) / (np.max(x_data) - np.min(x_data)).values\n#x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x,y,test_size = 0.2,random_state=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.021479,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.144899","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.12342","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask\"></a>\n\n### AUTO-SKLEARN\n\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*s2myX8bJIp9mQ2V_htcEpw.png)\n\n\n### We begin with auto-sklearn which is basically the auto-ml component of the most used ML framework SCIKIT-LEARN.\n\n### Auto-sklearn frees a machine learning user from algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning. It leverages recent advantages in Bayesian optimization, meta-learning and ensemble construction. [Here](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5872-efficient-and-robust-automated-machine-learning.pdf) is the paper for this framework, in case you are interested. \n\n### It Creates a pipeline and optimizes it using Bayesian search. Two components are added to Bayesian hyperparameter optimization of an ML framework: meta-learning for initializing the Bayesian optimizer and automated ensemble construction from configurations evaluated during optimization. It performs well on small and medium-sized datasets, but it cannot be applied to modern deep learning systems that yield state-of-the-art performance on large datasets.\n\n\n### Lets build a model now.\n\n\n### Here are the main features of the API. You can:\n\n    - Set time and memory limits\n    - Restrict the searchspace by selecting or excluding some preprocessing methods or some estimators\n    - Specify some resampling strategies (e.g. 5-fold cv)\n    - Perform some parallel computation with the SMAC algorithm (sequential model-based algorithm configuration) that stores some data on a shared file system\n    - Save your model as you would do with scikit-learn (pickle)"},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.194979Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.194043Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.197529Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.198562Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.032157,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.198792","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.166635","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip install -U scikit-learn\n\nimport sklearn\nprint(sklearn.__version__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.251661Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.250906Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.745098Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.744237Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.522541,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.745244","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:18.222703","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!curl -OL https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/mlbox/tarball/3.0-dev","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.809009Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.804252Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.473405Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.472553Z"},"papermill":{"duration":11.706057,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.47354","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:19.767483","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!apt-get -y remove swig\n\n!apt-get -y install swig3.0 build-essential -y\n\n!ln -s /usr/bin/swig3.0 /usr/bin/swig\n!apt-get -y install build-essential\n\n#!pip install --upgrade setuptools\n#!pip install auto-sklearn\n#!pip install --no-cache-dir -v pyrfr\n\n\n#try:\n #   import autosklearn.classification\n#except:\n #   pass","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.554407Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.553229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.378638Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.377718Z"},"papermill":{"duration":166.872365,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.378792","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:16:31.506427","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install git+https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.040493,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.458877","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.418384","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Is ensemble default in auto-sklearn?\n\n    - Yes, refer Introduction section in the paper mentioned above\n    \n    \nBelow is a simple auto-sklearn pipeline    "},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.543727Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.542694Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.545296Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.545902Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.047865,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.546075","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.49821","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip uninstall -y scikit-learn\n\n#import sklearn\n#print(sklearn.__version__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.63304Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.632113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.63545Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.634825Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.048723,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.635575","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.586852","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip install scikit-learn\n\n#import sklearn\n#print(sklearn.__version__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.03922,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.714285","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:19:18.675065","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"** IGNORE THE ERRORS FROM MLBOX AND AUTOSKLEARN** , THERE IS A PACKAGE ISSUE IN KAGGLE AND IT SOMETIMES DOESNT WORK AND SOMETIMES WORKS!!

Additionally, it’s also not able to processes categorical strings, which must be integer-encoded before being passed in as data.\n\n\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1537396029/output_2_0_d7uh0v.png)\n\n\n#### SOURCE - DATACAMP"},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.638944Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.638134Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.664892Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.664281Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.124079,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.665026","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.540947","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/titanic/train.csv\") \ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.975586Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.974516Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.985106Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.984057Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.229159,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.98531","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:51.756151","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.fillna(-999)\n\ndf_class = df['Survived'].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.190233Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.189043Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.194675Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.195271Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.105882,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.195458","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.089576","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ntraining_indices, validation_indices = training_indices, testing_indices = train_test_split(df.index,\n                                                                                            stratify = df_class,\n                                                                                            train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.404698Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.403573Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.408349Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.409335Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.123876,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.409558","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.285682","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_indices.size, validation_indices.size","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.091141,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.606323","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.515182","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### For TPOT, everything needs to be in float or int, therefore deleting variables that are not those for example purpose."},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.800586Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.799559Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.802756Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.802167Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.103275,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.802921","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.699646","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df.info()\ndf.drop(['Name', 'PassengerId', 'Sex', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'Embarked'], axis=1, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.089633,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.984093","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:52.89446","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"TPOTClassifier has a wide variety of parameters, and you can read all about them here.

The current version provides functionalities to automatically search for hyperparameters during the deep learning process. Auto-Keras tends to simplify the ML process through the use of automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. Neural Architecture Search essentially replaces the deep learning engineer/practitioner with a set of algorithms that automatically tunes the model.\n\n\n#### For deep learning, for now you have the ImageClassifier, the BayesianSearcher, a Graph module, a PreProcessor, a LayerTransformer, a NetTransformer, a ClassifierGenerator and some utilities. This is an evolving package.\n\n\n#### For tabular dataset, keras has a method called StructuredDataClassifier which is what we will use. Keras also has Automodel that combines multiple inputs. So in simple words, StructuredDataClassifier, TextClassifiers etc. are all TaskAPIs. \n\nWhen doing a classical task such as image classification/regression, text classification/regression, ..., you can use the simplest APIs provided by autokeras called Task API: ImageClassifier, ImageRegressor, TextClassifier, TextRegressor, ... In this case you have one input (image or text or tabular data, ...) and one output (classification, regression). \n\nAutomodel, however when you are in a situation where you have for example a task that requires multi inputs/outputs architecture, then you cannot use directly Task API, and this is where Automodel comes into play with the I/O API. \n\nGraphAutomodel works like keras functional API. It assembles different blocks (Convolutions, LSTM, GRU, ...) and create a model using this block, then it will look for the best hyperparameters given this architecture you provided. \n    \n\nKeras AUTOMODEL is mainly used for Multi-Modal and Multi-Task. \n\nMulti-model data means each data instance has multiple forms of information. For example, a photo can be saved as a image. Besides the image, it may also have when and where it was taken as its attributes, which can be represented as structured data.\n\nMulti-task here we refer to we want to predict multiple targets with the same input features. For example, we not only want to classify an image according to its content, but we also want to regress its quality as a float number between 0 and 1.\n\n    \n#### Now, lets do the modeling using StructuredDataClassifier"},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:25:54.477689Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:25:54.47688Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:27:33.81498Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:27:33.809161Z"},"papermill":{"duration":99.437711,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:33.815129","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:25:54.377418","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install autokeras\n\n!pip install git+https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner.git@1.0.2rc1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:27:38.25664Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:27:38.255527Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:27:41.042514Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:27:41.041668Z"},"papermill":{"duration":5.009076,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:41.042684","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:36.033608","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport autokeras as ak\n\nx_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/titanic/train.csv\")\n\nprint(type(x_data))\n\ny = x_data.pop('Survived')\n\nprint(type(y))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:27:45.570664Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:27:45.569573Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:27:45.589319Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:27:45.590095Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.306334,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:45.590281","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:43.283947","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_train = pd.DataFrame(y)\n\nprint(type(y_train)) \n\n# You can also use numpy.ndarray for x_train and y_train.\n\nx_train = x_data.to_numpy().astype(np.unicode)\n\ny_train = y.to_numpy()\n\nprint(type(x_train)) \n\nprint(type(y_train)) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:27:50.139158Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:27:50.137972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:27:50.146774Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:27:50.147375Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.291031,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:50.147566","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:47.856535","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preparing testing data.\n\nx_test = pd.read_csv(\"../input/titanic/test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-08-16T17:27:54.739332Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-08-16T17:27:54.738308Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-08-16T17:27:54.740837Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-08-16T17:27:54.741453Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.362433,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:54.741623","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:52.37919","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sklearn\n\nfrom sklearn import model_selection, metrics\n%timeit\n\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split(x_data, y, random_state=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":2.28547,"end_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:59.262306","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-08-16T17:27:56.976836","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The arguments used in structured data classification class:\n\n#### Arguments\n\ncolumn_names: A list of strings specifying the names of the columns.

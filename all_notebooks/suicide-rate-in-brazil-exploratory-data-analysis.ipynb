That is, the person himself takes his life.\nWhat we usually see in individuals who resort to this attitude is the psychological situation they are in. Failure to recover from a trauma, whether recent or not; the recent loss of a loved one are examples of factors that greatly influence the person in choosing to put an end to what he is living.\n\n  The yellow September was created in 2014, in order to help prevent suicide through media campaigns, so that this issue brings the population closer, in order to think about the problem. After all, talking about this extreme act becomes more and more necessary, since the cases have been increasing in recent years.\n\n  Depression has been identified as the great villain in this story. Therefore, the identification and treatment of this disease is of paramount importance, preferably in the early stages. However, due to the lack of information, people still treat this disease as a \"freshness\", ignoring its signs, and thus aggravating its consequences.\n  \n  Like homicide and traffic accident rates, suicide rates vary with age groups, sex and race. A first picture on the subject was provided by the work of Durkheim (2014) in the book The suicide. The author, in 1897, stated that the number of voluntary deaths varied according to the degree of integration and regulation of individuals in society. When comparing Catholics, Protestants and Jews, Durkheim concluded that the weakening of traditional ties (visible in the family, political society, religion) was an indicator of excessive individuation, of loss of cohesion, leading to an increase in voluntary deaths. On the other hand, too much social integration also led to suicide, as observed, for example, in the army, where the taste for impersonality, willingness to renounce, passive obedience, absolute submission and impersonalism developed. Durkheim also pointed out that suicide rates increased during periods of industrial or economic-financial crises. The reason for this would be the fact that in the anomic state, that is, of disturbance of the collective order, society leaves individual passions without restraint."},{"metadata":{"id":"SqA4-CF7rIMM","outputId":"d8890496-98e7-46ff-f1d0-47dcc8400356","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nsns.set_style(\"dark\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"hPYO3qrniQ_o","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"color_gender = ['#F781D8', '#819FF7']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"C1p9tfCpzXDr","outputId":"c6ab5a52-8d8e-4edf-cbbf-3101d32a2f20","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlosfab/data_science/master/datasets/suicide_rates.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"u95YbD6m0Fln"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data dictionary\n\n**Country**: Column representing countries (string)\n\n**Year**: Column representing years (integer)\n\n**Sex**: Column representing genres (string)\n\n**Age**: Column representing ages (string)\n\n**Suicides_no**: Column representing the number of suicides (integer)\n\n**Population**: Column representing the population (integer)\n\n**Suicides / 100k pop**: Column that represents the number of suicides per 100 thousand inhabitants (float)\n\n**Country-year**: Column that represents (string)\n\n**HDI for year**: Column that represents the HDI in each year (float)\n\n**Gdp_for_year($)**: Column representing GDP in each year (string)\n\n**Gdp_per_capita($)**: Column representing GDP per capita (float)\n\n**Generation**: Column that represents the generation (string)\n\nAs we are dealing with the Brazilian case, we will limit our dataframe, selecting only \"Brazil\" in the \"Country\" column"},{"metadata":{"id":"CvTSCK61znmi","outputId":"1e6e7dd5-750a-4dfb-9dc6-92dec96dd6f9","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_brazil = df[df['country']=='Brazil'].copy()\ndf_brazil.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Verifying missing datas"},{"metadata":{"id":"43SA8Okj0jnL","outputId":"348e40db-168c-4b60-f361-ed470a77815f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('World------------')\ndisplay(df.isnull().sum())\nprint('Brazil----------')\ndisplay(df_brazil.isnull().sum())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"qdpjQFx72mqI"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Suicide mean rate in Brazil X in the World\n\n---\nFirst, we will make a comparative analysis of the average number of suicides in Brazil x in the world.

Although there is no agreement on the period it covers, it generally includes people born from the 1960s to the end of the 1970s. [2]\n\n**Silent**: Silent Generation is a term used to refer to the population born between 1925 and 1942, namely during the Great Depression and World War II. [3]\n\n**Millenials**: Generation Y, also called millennial generation, internet generation, or millennials is a concept in Sociology that refers to the court of those born after the early 1980s until, approximately, the end of the century. Some authors consider until 2005. [4]\n\n**Boomers**: Baby boomers gives name to the generation of people born between the years 1946 and 1964. The expression can be freely translated as \"baby boom\". The term “explosion” is used here in the sense of “unbridled growth”, which has caused a demographic boom on the planet, especially in the United States. [5]\n\n**GI Generation**: Greatest generation (in English, Greatest generation) is an expression coined by journalist and writer Tom Brokaw, in his book The Greatest Generation, to refer to the generation formed by individuals who grew up during the Great Depression (1929–39) in United States and later participated in the fighting of the Second World War (1939–45, with participation of the USA between 1941 and 1945), as well as by those who, remaining in the country, participated in the war effort in the so-called home front. [6]\n\n**Generation Z**: Generation Z is the sociological definition for the generation of people born, on average, between the second half of the 1990s until the beginning of 2010. The theory most accepted by scholars is that it emerged as a succession to Generation Y, from end of 1982 (beginning of Echo Boom). Therefore, it is the generation that corresponds to the idealization and birth of the World Wide Web, created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee, and in the \"boom\" of the creation of modern technological devices. The great nuance of this generation is to zap, having several options, among television channels, internet, video games and smartphones.

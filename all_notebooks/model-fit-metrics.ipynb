For a vector of values $y$, a vector of predictions $\\hat{y}$, both of length $n$, and a value average $\\bar{y}$, $R^2$ is determined by:\n\n$$R^2(y, \\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_0^{n-1} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_0^{n-1}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2}$$\n\nThe coefficient of determination is a measure of how well future samples will be predicted by the model. The best possible score is 1. A constant model which always predicts the average will recieve a score of 0. A model which is arbitrarily worse than an averaging model will recieve a negative score (this shouldn't happen in practice obviously!).\n\nIn practice, it is a \"best default\" model score: other metrics may be better to use, depending on what you are optimizing for, but the $R^2$ is just generally very good, and should be the first number you look at in most cases.\n\n$R^2$ is such a popular metric that there are artificial $R^2$ scores, designed to work in a similar way but with completely different underlying mathematics, which are defined for other non-regression operations.\n\n### Hand Implementation","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e10b48cb2ba4b7121a7372b92c47bf40693cb1c9","_cell_guid":"59998d92-5794-40c9-9a2b-a265567625db"}},{"source":"import numpy as np\n\ndef r2_score(y, y_pred):\n    rss_adj = np.sum((y - y_pred)**2)\n    n = len(y)\n    y_bar_adj = (1 / n) * np.sum(y)\n    ess_adj = np.sum((y - y_bar_adj)**2)\n    return 1 - rss_adj / ess_adj\n\nr2_score(y, y_pred)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"3327b7d04f592c996c9f2fb3e1e7992178dec8fc","_cell_guid":"51aa3413-8fb2-4186-b1c5-b7b6ca8109c0"},"execution_count":null},{"source":"### Scikit-learn implementation","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"34997a032079f5aad6690040b001ca97235f5d56","_cell_guid":"3d2d0e9f-5782-4f5b-93f2-c61c326021bb"}},{"source":"from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nr2_score(y, y_pred)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d39ab0b34a55351b8e1fae1515fcce0205647079","_cell_guid":"1d329b6e-1135-4ac9-99ae-8c302ba681fc"},"execution_count":null},{"source":"## Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe residual sum of squares is the top term in the $R^2$ metric (albeit adjusted by 1 to account for degrees of freedom).

This is considered a good thing when doing cetain things, like performing hyperparameter searches. However, MAE is a more useful reporting statistic because MAE is *interpretable*, while RMSE is not.\n\nContext for this comparison [here](https://medium.com/human-in-a-machine-world/mae-and-rmse-which-metric-is-better-e60ac3bde13d).\n\nNote that `scikit-learn` doesn't provide a RMSE evaluator directly...","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"289e05643a74192b72b0d2144dcc752a032c0a6f","_cell_guid":"2c63e96d-24e6-4b32-ac63-5fd370b30878"}},{"source":"## Explained variance score\n\n### Discussion\n\nThe explained variance score is a very clever (IMO) metric which looks at the ratio between the variance of the model/truth differences and the variance of the ground truth alone:\n\n$$\\text{explained variance}(y, \\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{Var({y}) - Var(\\hat{y})}{Var(y)}$$\n\nHence the moniker \"explained variance\".

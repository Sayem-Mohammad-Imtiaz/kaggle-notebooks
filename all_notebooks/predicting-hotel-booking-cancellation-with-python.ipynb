But technological advancements is not the only reason hotels see more cancellations. It turns out that psychology plays a role in this as well. Consumers are always looking for ways to minimize their cost of buying something, so if they found out that they can buy the same thing at a lower price than they paid for, they would attempt to cancel and repurchase, and that’s what usually happens with hotel bookings.\n","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

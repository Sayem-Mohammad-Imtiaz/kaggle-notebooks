If not a strong index finger to scroll down should do.  In either case, here are a few observations:\n\n 1. **Age** of players across leagues is essentially the same.  Comments speaking to the wider (taller) interquartile range (IQR = the box) for the bronze league and higher median for the Grandmaster league could be made but I believe the HoursPerWeek attribute would be stronger \"experience\" attribute to think through.  \n\n 2. **HoursPerWeek, TotalHours, APM, SelectByHotKeys, AssignToHotkeys, UniqueHotkeys** all suggest the same volume = player strength theme.   Every attribute (with the exception of the **GapBetweenPACs** and **ActionLatency**, where lower metrics translate to stronger game play) trends up and to the right across Leagues.\n\n 3. It's worth noting that the **HoursPerWeek** attribute has the greatest IQR and median.  If a player is in the most competitive Grandmaster league, it makes sense that some of those players put in a lot of time to reach that level vs others that are \"naturally\" talented at the game (speaking to the wide range).  Regardless, Grandmaster level players do play more from a median perspective.  \n\n 4. **NumberofPACs**, where a PAC stands for a *Perception Action Cycle* and is defined by it's wiki as \"when one changes screen location and performs 1+ actions before changing screen location again to repeat.\"  So the more a player increases his visibility and performs game actions the more likely he is to be a better player.  Makes sense.  \n\n 5. **GapBetweenPACs** works in the opposite direction where the fewer seconds that pass between PACs means a player is more active with his mouse and increasing his **NumberofPACs**.  I suspect we may run into some ***multicollinearity*** issues from this later, something to watch out for.\n\nAdditional commentary speaking to individual attributes to be added later."},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"7e7a143c-03f8-4ac5-8aa3-4e87febe5315","_uuid":"89d342ead102459e90d2c17a642995a5dd5416fc"},"execution_count":null,"source":"### Attribute Analysis - UniqueUnitsMade  \n\nI've separated the **UniqueUnitsMade** attribute out from the above because it is more interesting to me than any other at this early stage of analysis.  The reason here is because UniqueUnitsMade is the only attribute that reverses the clear trend you see from Bronze to Master league for other attributes, where the median and IQR all continue in the same direction.  \n\nWith **UniqueUnitsMade**, Grandmaster league players appear to create less unique units per time stamp than any other level- even less than Bronze level players!  My guess is that the amount of micromanagement required to control multiple unique units with different abilities outweighs the benefits that having that diversity.  In other words, being able to direct 20 of the same units and abilities may be more effective than 4 different groups of 5 units.  \n\nAnother thought is that Grandmaster league players may \"rush\" their opponents at the start of a game more frequently than players in other leagues.  Spending more time early on trying to find and attack your enemy vs building up a vast fleet of units and attacking them later in the game seems to agree with having less **UniqueUnitsMade.** The **TotalMapExplored** attribute seems to support this too.\n\nHowever, it's still very intriguing that Master Level players don't show even a slight decline vs Diamond Level players and the drastic drop off of **UniqueUnitsMade** from Master to Grandmaster.  The small sample size for Grandmaster Level players could also speak to the break in trend.

The reverse holds true for negative values, where if one variable increases, the other variable decreases.\n\nHere, it looks like the darkest blue boxes in (APM, SelectByHotKeys, AssignToHotKeys, NumberOfPACs) and the lightest yellow boxes (GapBetween PACs, ActionLatency) have the strongest associations with **LeagueIndex.**    So players with greater **APM** (Actions Per Minute) tend to be associated with a higher **LeagueIndex.**\n\nHowever, any stats 101 tutorial will say that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation - and the same holds true here.

The visuals are from plotly. In addition to that, it also has valuable insights on the quality of food we eat and nutrients that it carries.\n\n\n**CONTEXT: FOOD & NUTRITION**\n\nNutrition inside the food are the way we get fuel, providing energy for our bodies. We need to replace nutrients in our bodies with a new supply every day. Fats, proteins, and carbohydrates are all required. Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.\n\nCounting calories and reducing fat intake is the number one advice given by all dieticians and nutritionist. The knowledge about nutrition is essential part to keep eating mindfully and also peace of mind. Furthermore, a diet filled with vegetables, fruits and whole grains could help prevent major conditions such as stroke, diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\n**CONTENT:**\n\n   **1.

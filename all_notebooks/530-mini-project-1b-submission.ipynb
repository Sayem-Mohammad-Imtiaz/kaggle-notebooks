We can also see that Likes and Views or Dislikes and Views positively correlate because the size of circle becomes bigger as x or y increases. It is interesting to see that the circles, however, are distributed heavily towards the two ends (0,0 and 16M, 800k), and that Trending Videos with 8M-12M Likes tend to have fewer number of Dislikes (below 200k) compared to Trending Videos with fewer number of Likes.  ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\nHere are some of the insights from the data analysis:\n- Music (11.233k) and Entertainment (11.208k) are the top two categories with the most number of Trending Videos. However, the top two channels with the most Trending Videos were NFL (410) and NBA (370), which fall into Sports category. Sports (6.1k) is the 3rd category with the most Trending Videos.\n- Nonprofit & Activism (53) has the least number of Trending Videos which is concerning considering the topics and issues these videos address need the world's most attention.\n- There was not much difference between the most used words in titles vs. tags. The 2 most dominant words, according to Wordcloud, used in titles were \"video\" and \"official\", while those in tags were \"new\" and \"video\". Since these are very generic words, it seems like titles or tags play little role in a video becoming Trending.\n- The number of Likes, Dislikes and Views of Trending Videos are mostly positively correlated. If we interpret Likes and Dislikes as 'engagement', this means more engagment has more views and vice versa.\n- Interestingly, however, Trending Videos with a middle-ranged number of Likes (8-10M, out of 16M) seem to get relatively fewer Dislikes (less than 200K). This may be because there is a correlation between the number of Likes and discoverability of the videos, which has not been identified in this research.","metadata":{}}]}

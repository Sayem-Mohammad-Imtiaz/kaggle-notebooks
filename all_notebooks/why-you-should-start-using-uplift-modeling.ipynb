Intro:\n- 💡You can also make your own experiment/research with this project, simply search for **'XGBClassifier()'**, and modify it with other algorithms available out there, or take a look at the **'future research'** section in the end of this project.\n- 👉This project is an experiment for this research http://ijair.id/index.php/ijair/article/view/169/pdf\n- 👉Published in the International Journal of Artificial Inteligence.\n- 👉Ranked 2 in Science & Technology Index Indonesia.\n- 👉In a nutshell, this project compares the [predictive & prescriptive](https://insights.principa.co.za/4-types-of-data-analytics-descriptive-diagnostic-predictive-prescriptive) capabilities of a mainstream [Employee Turnover Prediction (ETP)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328796091_Employee_Turnover_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning_A_Reliable_Approach) VS Employee Uplift Modeling (ETU) with the XGBoost algorithm.\n\n\n## Abstract:\n\n**i. ❓Background:** Employee turnover is the loss of talent in the workforce that can be costly for a company. Uplift modeling is one of several prescriptive methods available in machine learning models that not only predict an outcome but also prescribe a solution. Recent studies are focusing on the conventional predictive models (binary classification) to predict employee turnover rather than uplift modeling.\n\n**ii. 🎯Aim:** In this research, we analyze whether the Uplift Modeling has better performance than the conventional predictive model in solving employee turnover.\n\n**iii. ⚙️Methodology:** Performance comparison between the two methods was carried out by experimentation using two synthetic datasets and one real dataset. XGBoost is used as the machine learning algorithm for both models in this experiment.\n\n**iv. ✔️Results:** After observing the 6 Qini curves, the results show that despite the ETP model yields an average prediction accuracy of 84%; it only yields a success rate of 50% to target the right employee with a retention program on the three datasets. By contrast, the uplift model only yields an average accuracy of 67% but yields a consistent success rate of 100% in targeting the right employee with a retention program.\n\n## Step by step\n1. 📊Three datasets are used in this project: [Dataset-1](https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics), [Dataset-2](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), and [Dataset-3](https://www.kaggle.com/davinwijaya/employee-turnover)\n2. 🎰[XGBoost](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-xgboost-applied-machine-learning/) is used in this project as the machine learning algorithm for both models (ETP & ETU)\n3. 🤖ETP Model just predict [employee's turnover](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-turnover-definitions-calculations-11611.html#:~:text=Employee%20turnover%20refers%20to%20the,to%2Dhire%20for%20budget%20purposes.) (turnover or stay)\n4. 🤖ETU model predicts  employee's [uplift category](https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/uplift-modeling-making-predictive-models-actionable/8578/) (Sure things, persuadables, lost causes, or sleeping dogs/do-not-disturbs)\n5. 🔎Predictive performances of both models are evaluated with the [Accuracy package from Sci-kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)\n6. 🏃ETP Model gives prescription by ranking the employee based on its risk of quitting (predicted probability)\n7. 📈ETU Model gives prescription by ranking the employee based on its uplift score (in this case I use [LGWUM](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219622019500172)'s formulation)\n8. 📉Prescriptive performances of both models are evaluated with [Qini Curve](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/147b/32f3d56566c8654a9999c5477dded233328e.pdf?_ga=2.266187788.2072205534.1599377562-943609542.1599377562)\n\n## Acknowledgement\n🙏 I also thank Giri Pujar, Pavan Subhash, and Eduard Babushkin for sharing the datasets used in this project.\nMoreover, this project is made by [me](linkedin.com/in/wijayadavin/) under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 common license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

Control Non–responders (CN): Employees who have not been treated with the retention program and left. We want to find the persuadables in this group.\n2. Control Responders (CR): Employees who have not been treated with the retention program and stay. We want to avoid targeting this group because we do not need to treat them to make them stay, and there is a possibility that some of them are Do-Not-Disturbs.\n3. Treated Non–Responders (TN): Employees who have been treated with the retention program but left. We want to avoid treating this group because they will leave if treated, and there is a possibility that some of them are Do-Not-Disturbs that will stay if left untreated.\n4. Treated Responders (TR): Employees who have been treated with the retention program and stayed. We also want to find the persuadables in this group.\n\nTherefore, by combining CN with CR and TN with TR will result in C, and T, respectively. Thus by fitting the treated and control group from those four target classes as visualized in the right table will yield four possible theoretical uplift classes (also known as the four quadrants):\n\n1. Do-Not-Disturb (CRTN): Sometimes referred to as sleeping dogs, employees who will be driven away if treated.\n2. Lost Causes (CNTN): Employees who will leave whether treated or not.\n3. Sure Things (CRTR): Employees who will stay whether treated or not.\n4. Persuadables (CNTR): Employees who are willing to leave but will stay if treated. We want to target this group to reduce overall employee turnover in the company.\n\nAfter predicting the four target classes which are visualized with XGBoost, four probability results are generated. Where P is the probability result, thus uplift score is calculated with LGWUM (Lai's Generalized Weighted Uplift Method) as: \n> ## Uplift Score = P(CN/C)+ P(TR/T) – P(CR/C) – P(TN/T)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# III.

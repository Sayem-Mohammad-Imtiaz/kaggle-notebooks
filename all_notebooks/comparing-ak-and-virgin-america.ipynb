Alaska Airlines has (I believe) in the past subscribed to the Southwest Airlines early model of using only one type of aircraft in order to greatly reduce maintenance costs. This was a key driver of Southwest Airline's early competitiveness (although their organizational culture also often receives, and apparently deserves, much of the credit for their performance.\n\nIf my first assumption is true, then it will be interesting to see if Virgin America has a fleet of similar makeup to the one employed currently by Alaska Airlines. If not that means a significant departure from their current business model and a possible long-term loss of organizational efficiency. In general terms, it seems that growth is actually a harbinger of decline for american airlines. It will be interesting to see if that is a possibility in this case.\n\nI take some small interest in this fact because I live in  Alaska and typically travel Outside (what Alaskans call the rest of the United States) on Alaska Airlines flights."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ad9194a8-d1b3-b1e8-5ec4-437f5a4c0c4c"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/Fleet Data.csv')\nprint(data.info())"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"91dfb00b-56e4-a5b6-1cbf-dbeb4bf817ae"},"source":"Looks like quite a bit of null entries, but that may  not be an issue.

I am intensely curious to know how Alaska's executives plan to integrate maintenance of the two carriers. Unfortunately I can't answer that question with this dataset. What I CAN do is look at the aircraft similiarities between Alaska and Frontier, another carrier that Alaska acquired some time ago. If there is a disparity in aircraft type there as well then I can at least assume that Alaska has had experience with this issue before and is therefore (hopefully) competent to deal with again (albeit on a larger scale this time)."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a61dbc14-b4b7-af23-0d70-dc6d9abf9c20"},"outputs":[],"source":"frontier_legacy = data[data['Airline'] == 'Frontier Airlines']\nalaska_legacy = alaska[alaska['Historic'] > 0]\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nbarplot = sns.barplot(x=frontier_legacy['Aircraft Type'], y=frontier_legacy['Current'], data=frontier_legacy)\nplt.setp(barplot.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)\n_ = plt.xlabel('Aircraft Type')\n_ = plt.ylabel('Formerly in Service')\n_ = plt.title('Legacy Frontier Fleet')\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nbarplot = sns.barplot(x=alaska_legacy['Aircraft Type'], y=alaska_legacy['Historic'], data=alaska_legacy)\nplt.setp(barplot.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)\n_ = plt.xlabel('Aircraft Type')\n_ = plt.ylabel('Formerly in Service')\n_ = plt.title('Legacy Alaska Fleet')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"72d48ca6-667d-0548-7edf-64f161fe6cc4"},"source":"Well, this is actually quite encouraging. Looks like Frontier, before it was absorbed by Alaska, actually had a fleet very similar in makeup to the one currently used by Virgin. Since none of these aircraft are currently in Alaska's inventory it seems likely that Alaska phased them out. I would bet money they were replaced with Boeing 737s, which comprise the bulk of Alaska's current fleet. \n\nI plotted Alaska's historic fleet as well just out of curiosity to see if the legacy Frontier aircraft show up. They don't (obviously). Not sure what the significance of that is. Did they replace all Frontier aircraft immediately upon acquisition of Frontier? That seems unlikely, just because it is so expensive, but perhaps they did so to mitigate long-term maintenance costs. I don't think this dataset will answer that question and I won't look into it any further.\n\nThe important thing here is that whatever the interoperability/phasing/maintenance issues that Alaska may encounter with Virgin's fleet, it is nothing that they have not encountered before.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I wonder what the relative values of these fleets are?

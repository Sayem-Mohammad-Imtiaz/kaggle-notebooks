Although the electoral college (state by state results) is most important in American elections, there are still less paths to win the presidency the less support a candidate acquires nationally.\n* In every battleground state we looked at, with the exception of Florida, Trump was underestimated in average polling by 4.5-6%, beyond margin of error for the average poll.  There is incredibly small probability that this occurred by chance, so this most likely means that these polls failed to be truly random or they did not take into account some outside factor such as voter enthusiasm.  However, the polls of likely voters barely deviated from the average of all polls.  Either the polling of \"likely voters\" is not at all accurate itself, or voter enthusiasm was not a huge factor.\n* In every populated state we looked, Trump was overestimated in the average of all polls, though this carried little effect in the electoral college process as these states voted the same direction anyway.  As New York, California, and Illinois are solid blue states, a simple explanation could be that Trump voters didn't see their ballot as worthwhile in these regions.  However, Texas, a consistent red state, is a different story.  Either Trump voters were complacent in Texas, or there was strong turnout for Clinton.\n* In Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the average of all polls did better than the polls that have been historically reliable.  In Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, three bordering northern states, the historically reliable polls were more accurate.  We should keep this in mind when analyzing 2020 polls.\n* In the final polling days leading up to the election, Clinton had negative momemtum nationally and in most states.  Keep in mind there were an additional few days between the end of the final polling period and voting day, so this negative momentum likely continued which caused polls to underestimate Trump's chances.\n\n* The Times-Picayune/Lucid, ABC News/Washington Post, and YouGov predicted the national popular vote most accurately.\n* Google Consumer Surveys and SurveyMonkey were most consistently accurate in the battleground states.\n* SurveyMonkey was a very accurate pollster in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin\n* Google Consumer Surveys was a very strong pollster in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Minnesota\n\n* Nationally, the number of polls a pollster released the final two weeks before the election predicted the final accuracy incredibly well.  We should trust pollsters who release more national polls before the election.\n* In battleground states, the number of polls a pollster released the final two weeks before the election also predicted the final accuracy quite well.  Of course, the sample size is smaller for state polls than national polls"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What Will Happen in 2020?

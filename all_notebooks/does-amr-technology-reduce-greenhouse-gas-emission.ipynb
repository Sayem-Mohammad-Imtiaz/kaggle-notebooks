AMR technology allows water meters to send readings to the cities computerized billing system up to four times per day. This allows the customer more access to water usage information at the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly resolution ([NYC Environmental Protection](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/dep/pay-my-bills/automated-meter-reading-frequently-asked-questions.page)).\n\n### Hypothesis\nThe hypothesis is that customers that opt into the installation of AMR technologies, are more aware of their environmental impact, and thus buildings with AMR tech installed have lower GHG emissions than those that don't. In order to control for exogenous and endogenous effects on total GHG (ghg), the buildings energy star score (ess), property floor area (area), and weather normalized energy use intensity (weui) are used as explantory variables. The following model is proposed,\n$$ghg_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 amr_i + \\beta_2 ess_i +\\beta_3 areai_i + \\beta_3 weui_i + \\epsilon_i$$\nA note of caution: the data available to us is very limited, and in many ways, incomplete. As such, it is expected that our explanatory variables will do a poor job at accurately predicting ghg emissions. In addition, building owners often do not have control over these explanatory variables, so we expect that there will be ommitted variables and that the explantory variables will over-fit the regression.\n\n## Preparing the data\nFirst, lets get a good look at how AMR buildings are distributed and how their charactaristics differ from those that are not fitted with AMR

Though we cannot yet conclude that the presence of AMR tech \"does not\" have an effect. The reason is due to the model itself and the data we have. The data we have is highly correlated with emmission of GHG. The more area in a building, the higher use of electricity, and thus the higher release of GHG's. The higher the WEUI, the more energy is required, and the higher the energy star rating, the less GHG is emmitted. While these all have the correct signs and are statistically significant except for the energy star rating, the high levels of collinearity between these variables are overfitting the model. This can be seen by the 100% explanatory power described by the adjusted R-squared. This is a sure sign that our model is mis-specified. Additionally, The loss of over 90% of the sample due to missing data may have caused our results to be un-representative.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe data provided in this set is simply not sufficient to predicting either the total greenhouse gas emissions or whether AMR technologies affect those emissions. This is due to the high level of missing data and the extremely low level of detail about the buildings. There exists high multicollinearity between the provided data as well. Had all data been present for the amount of observations, the story would have likely been much different.\n\nFuture research could be done by taking this analysis to a time series analysis instead of a cross-sectional as was done here for the year 2014. Additional data could also be provided such as the age of the buildings, price of electricty (if doing a time series analysis), and behavioral charactaristics on whether the buildings participated in energy conservation incentives."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

The unit on Simple Linear Regression covers following points.\n\n1.  [Simple Linear Regression (SLR): 7 Key points to remember.](https://youtu.be/--awGDpi9pk)\n2.  [SLR: Statistical Background](https://youtu.be/o1QWm6yLHdw)\n3.  [SLR: Estimating Model Parameters](https://youtu.be/h-WyE73E1yM)\n4.  [SLR: Evaluating Model Parameters](https://youtu.be/AvZ-4yFGwG4)\n\n\nThe notebook uses the data set of student's performance, and attendance recorded that I collected while teaching a course on Software Architecture in the year 2014. \n\nHere, I am  building two different models. First is to explore relationship between MSE and ESE. Second is to explore the relationship between classroom attendance and ESE."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**(1) Initilization**\n\nThis section imports modules such as Pandas, Numpy,  Matplotlib, Seaborn necessary to process the data.

This implies that students might be physically attending classes without any mindful academic engagement.   Also, the absolute value of t-statistic for slope is below one which is tiny to indicate a linear relationship.

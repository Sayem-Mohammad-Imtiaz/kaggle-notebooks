Description\nDivorce, also known as dissolution of marriage, is the process of terminating a marriage or marital union. Divorce usually entails the canceling or reorganizing of the legal duties and responsibilities of marriage, thus dissolving the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law of the particular country or state.\n\nData taken from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

The PCA method projects the observations on the main components of the matrix of attributes (hopefully, a smaller number of them), which retain the greatest variance. SAR is an uncontrolled method (without a teacher), that is, it does not use information from the target vector and instead considers only a matrix of features.\nFor a mathematical description of how PCA works, refer to external resources. Principal component analysis is implemented in the scikit-leam library using the PCA class. The n_components argument has two operations, depending on the given value. If the value of this argument is greater than 1, then n_components will return the specified number of attributes. This leads to the question of choosing the optimal number of features. Fortunately for us, if the value of the n_components argument is between 0 and 1, then the object created on the basis of the PCA class returns the minimum number of features that preserve the specified variance. Typically, the values 0.95 and 0.99 are used, i.e., 95% and 99% of the variance of the original features will be preserved. The whiten = True argument converts the values of each principal component so that they have zero mean and unit variance. Another argument is svd_solver = \"randomized\", which implements a stochastic algorithm for finding the first principal components, which, as a rule, takes much less time.The result of our solution shows that the X-ray diffraction method allows one to reduce the dimension by 10 features, while retaining 99% of the information (variance) in the feature matrix.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Additional reading material","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

Intuitively, the NMF method can reduce the dimension, since in matrix multiplication two factors (multiplied matrices) can have significantly smaller dimensions than the product matrix. Formally, if the desired number of returned characteristics r is given, then the NMF method decomposes the matrix of attributes so that:\n\nV « WH\n\nwhere V is our matrix of signs d x n (d signs, n observations);  \nW is the matrix d x r;  \nH is the matrix r x n.  \nBy adjusting the r value, you can set the volume of the desired dimensionality reduction.  \n\nOne of the main requirements of the NMA method is that, as the name implies, the feature matrix cannot contain negative values. In addition, unlike the PCA method, the NMA method does not provide us with an explained variance of the resulting features.

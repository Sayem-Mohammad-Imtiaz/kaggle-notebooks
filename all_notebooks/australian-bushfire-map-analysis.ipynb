We will take a look at fire data obtained from NASA satellite's MODIS and VIIRS.\n\nWhat is covered - \n- Regions with Highest recorded fire radiation in a day\n- Dates on which bushfires were at a peak.\n- Timeline of bushfire - barplot\n- A heat map with time - for Australian bushfire\n- Canberra Fire over the last 10 days\n- Kangaroo island fire\n\nNote :\n- Also since the loading time could be high we will only consider data for the last 3 months -

Due to this people's mobility has also reduced across regions.\nThe given dataset is an Apple provided mobility report (across transportation types such as `walking`, `driving`, `transit`.\n\n    How the mobility of people carrying the Apple mobile phones has changes, provides us an opportunity to study the mobility behaviors across the regions.\n    \nIn this notebook, we shall do some EDA on this data to understand how the nations/regions followed some strict lockdown measures imposed by the governement, and how was the distribution of decreased mobility across different transport types. We will plot the population mobility (population using Apple product) to understand whether lockdown restrictions were abided by people of those regions.\n\nFurther Work:\nThis dataset can be further used for making judgments in taking decisions or actions, as to which region is more vulnerable to become a hotspot (If the mobility of a city/ region is increasing suddenly, that would mean that the chances of COVID 19 spreading would increase, and government would require to take best measures to control this mobility).\n\nLimitation: The dataset comes from Apple's product mobility, and hence the inferences would represent only fraction of the people who use Apple products. This becomes even more limiting in making inferences for regions, where Apple products do not have enough reach - this will result in very less data from that region."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apple = pd.read_csv('../input/apples-mobility-report/Copy of applemobilitytrends-2020-04-14.csv')\napple.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apple.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apple.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apple.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(apple.geo_type.unique())\nprint(apple.transportation_type.unique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# drop country/ region as it is not needed in the analysis\n\napple = apple.drop(['geo_type'], axis = 1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(apple.region.nunique())\nregions = list(apple.region.unique())\nprint(regions)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Visualization Objectives:\n\n-Visualize mobility of people in different countries over time (1/13/2020 to 04/14/2020)\n\n-Mobility can be visualized for the Transportantion_types"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"apple_total_mob_per_day = apple.groupby(['region']).sum().reset_index()\napple_total_mob_per_day","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# defining a function for plotting the cumulative mobility across all transport types for a given region/country\n\ndef plot_mobility_total(region_country):\n    apple_total_mob_per_day_region = apple_total_mob_per_day[apple_total_mob_per_day.region == region_country]\n    apple_total_mob_per_day_region = apple_total_mob_per_day_region.drop(['region'], axis = 1)\n    apple_total_mob_per_day_region = apple_total_mob_per_day_region.T\n    apple_total_mob_per_day_region.columns = ['Cumulative Mobility across all transport']\n    apple_total_mob_per_day_region.plot.line()\n    \n    \n    \n# defining function to take region name input from the user.\n\ndef input_region():\n    print('\\nWhich region/country mobility report would you like to see?')\n    region_name = input()\n    if(region_name in regions):\n        print('\\nBelow plotted is the mobility report for the region/country: ', region_name)\n        plot_mobility_total(region_name)\n    else:\n        print('\\nData on this region/country is not available')\n        print('\\nWanna see the mobility plots of some other region/country ?

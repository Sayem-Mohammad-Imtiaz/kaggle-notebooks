Initially you will look at simple linear functions of one variable: this is the same as *drawing a line of best fit* or *finding a regression line*. To do this you will need to import some additional libraries and commands:\n\n`numpy` is the numerical library often used in Python programs. You need it here so that the `sklearn` can read the lists/array or numbers correctly.\n\n`sklearn` is the *scikit-learn* library. This is required for creating and anlaysing your linear model.

You can take the top 80% of rows for the training set and the bottom 20% of the rows for the testing set. *Note: this makes the assumption that the rows in the dataset are in a random order.

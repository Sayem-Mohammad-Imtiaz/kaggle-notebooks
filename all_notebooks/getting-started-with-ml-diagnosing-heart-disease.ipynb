If the output from a model is the particular course of treatment (potentially with side-effects), or surgery, or the absence of treatment, people are going to want to know why we should trust that model or it's result.So we need the best models to apply in the field of medical.\n\nNow In this kernel we will build a baseline model for the prediction of whether the given person has heart disease or not.\n\nWe will do this step by step from  Exploratory Data Analysis to Validation of Model.I will try to make every concept very clear for you\nto understand in simple language and please upvote it if you find it useful.\n\nNow we will first look at the basic workflow that everyone should follow in the model building:-\n\n**1)Primary thing is collecting the data** and as for now we have the large datasets to work on ... so it's not an problem. \n\n\n**2)Next thing is data preprocessing** and it is the most important phase of all phases:It includes:-\n\n      2.1) Analysis of features(knowing the meaning of each and every feature).\n\n      2.2) Finding or Exploring all the trends between the features(using different kinds of plots gives an insight into the given data).\n    \n      2.3) Adding new features by combining given features(if they seem to be helpful)\n  \n      2.4) Removing redundant features(Features which may have no effect on output of the model)\n  \n      2.5) Converting all the features into suitable form for modelling(I'll explain in depth about this later on).\n\n\n**3)Researching the model that will be best for the type of data**\n\n       3.1)checking out on all the algorithms we know and tuning the parameters.\n   \n\n**4)Training and testing the model**\n\n       4.1) Cross Validation.\n   \n\n**5)Evaluation**\n    \n       5.1) Plotting ROC Curve, Precision/Recall Curve, AUC\n   \n       5.2) Model Comparison (Accuracy + F1 Score)\n   \n\n**6)optional(ensemble)**\n\n       6.1) Then we can ensemble the best models we got into a powerful model....\n       \n       6.2) Important Features Extraction(To best explain the model with explanitory resources of ml).\n\nSo now let's start....\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>1.Gathering the data:-</h2>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are going to use Heart Disease UCI Dataset and let's load the libraries that we need:-"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ncolor=sns.color_palette()#helps to give colors to the plots\nimport warnings ## importing warnings library. \nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore') ## Ignore warning","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now load the dataset.."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dt=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv')\ndt.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>2.1)Analysis of features:-</h3>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now know some details about every feature:-\n\n    age: The person's age in years\n    sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n    cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n    trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n    chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\n    fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true;

In autumn and winter months, large scale crop residue burning in agriculture fields – a low cost alternative to mechanical tilling – is a major source of smoke, smog and particulate pollution. India has a low per capita emissions of greenhouse gases but the country as a whole is the third largest after China and the United States.A 2013 study on non-smokers has found that Indians have 30% lower lung function compared to Europeans.\n\nThe Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act was passed in 1981 to regulate air pollution and there have been some measurable improvements. However, the 2016 Environmental Performance Index ranked India 141 out of 180 countries."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-10/0enp7f7g_delhi-air-pollution_625x300_30_October_18.jpg)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9e1edc31185f3729be97aa126124256016af993"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Two days before Diwali, residents of Delhi and its neighbouring cities woke up to dense smog this morning. The capital's weather index showed a sharp decline in air quality across the city. While the Air Quality Index in Delhi's Anand Vihar showed a reading of 912, which means 'hazardous' pollution, other pollution indicators showed a spike too. PM2.5, which is considered very harmful to health, showed a reading of 644 or over 20 times the safe limit prescribed by the WHO. PM10 pollutant showed a reading of 785, which too is nearly 30 times the safe limit.\n\nPM2.5 pollutant are tiny particles that can enter the lungs and bloodstream and cause serious harm.

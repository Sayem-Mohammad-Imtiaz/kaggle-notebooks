Overview\nAirbnb is a popular platform for finding alternative places to stay for vacation. The platform features homes from all over the world. Homes from luxurious mansions in Southern California to treehouses in Bali. In this project, I will highlight the NYC listings using visualizations.\n\nThis project is broken into 2 parts: \n1.  In the first part, section 2, I will import and clean the raw data using Python.\n2. In the second part, I will create meaningful visualizations using Tableau. This will span from section 3 through section 4. \n\t* In section 3, we will see how price is distributed, where homes are distributed, and if the total space available has an affect on price. \n\t* In section 4, the visuals built will tells us how different types of host affect price.\n\nThe goal of this project is to:\n* Understand and highlight the Airbnb NYC home market.\n* Conduct an extensive exploratory data analysis. \n* Create story-telling visualizations to illustrate our findings.\n\nWe will ultimately learn:\n* What affects a listing's price.\n* Hot spot of listings. \n* The difference between aged hosts and newer host on the platform.\n* A distribution of the reviews of listings\n* And more. \n\nAlthough Python can handle both the cleaning and building of visuals through libraries such as Matplotlib or Seaborn, I am demonstrating the seamless connection between Python and Tableau. The two together make great for fast analytics and visualization.\n\nLet’s get started.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"26606e997cb10e4f103ddcf19f23d7f759d038c5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

In the histogram below, we map out the count of reviews; the bins are sized 1.

While this is not a confirmed theory, I believe the spike at 80 is because users default to ratings that end in the  number 0. We can also see a similar spike at 90, and also, perhaps why a rating of 100 is very high."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f8dd3d6a9cb9a8926c8b1acd2ae1a336482a761e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/gVyRo0/Distribution-of-Reviews.png\" alt=\"Distribution-of-Reviews\" border=\"0\" width=700 height=1000>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a0312d3d445a7e4ec9c7e3f0a50bb9b1b6efb555"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This distribution of reviews is very informative.

This would help you give an intuition of what you will face ahead of time. Let us see the problem statement -\n\nDream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.\n\nThis is a standard supervised classification task.A classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).Classification can be of two types:\n\nSupervised: The labels are included in the training data and the goal is to train a model to learn to predict the labels from the features.\nBinary Classification : In this classification we have to predict either of the two given classes. For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.\n\nMulticlass Classification : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes. For example: classifying a movie's genre as comedy, action or romantic, classify fruits as oranges, apples, or pears, etc.\n\nLoan prediction is a very common real-life problem that each retail bank faces atleast once in its lifetime. If done correctly, it can save a lot of man hours at the end of a retail bank.\n\nAlthough this notebook is specifically built to give you a walkthrough of Loan Prediction problem, you can always refer the content to get a comprehensive overview to solve a classification problem.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Hypothesis generation\nAfter looking at the problem statement, we will now move into hypothesis generation.

If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.\n\nLoan term: Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.\n\nEMI: Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval.\n\nThese are some of the factors which i think can affect the target variable, you can come up with many more factors","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the data\nGiven below is the description for each variable.\n\nVariable ----- Description\n\nLoan_ID -->> Unique Loan ID\n\nGender -->> Male/ Female\n\nMarried -->> Applicant married (Y/N)\n\nDependents -->> Number of dependents\n\nEducation -->> Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)\n\nSelf_Employed -->> Self employed (Y/N)\n\nApplicantIncome -->> Applicant income\n\nCoapplicantIncome -->> Coapplicant income\n\nLoanAmount -->> Loan amount in thousands\nLoan_Amount_Term -->> Term of loan in months\n\nCredit_History -->> credit history meets guidelines\n\nProperty_Area -->> Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural\n\nLoan_Status -->> Loan approved (Y/N)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# import required package","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For this practice problem, we have been given two CSV files: train and test.\n\nTrain file will be used for training the model, i.e. our model will learn from this file.

**Why was there a sudden spike in the stock values of the company in January 2021?** \n\nThe Gamestop Corporation which sells and hosts hardware and software video games in stores had been witnessing a contsant fall in its stock prices which was catalysed as the pandemic hit because people had no choice but to shift to online channels to play games.\n\nDue to the previous falling trend of the stock prices, large hedge funds and the people who bet against the stock believed that the stock prices would go down furthur in the coming months. People started discussing and making potential memes on Reddit's subreddit 'wallstreetbets'.\n\nSeveral posts on Reddit around January 2021 brought up GameStop as a potentially viable inverstment opportunity and tweets of notable personlaities like Elon Musk escalated the stock prices even more.The dramatic increase in the stock prices was a result of constant efforts on social media to raise the value of company stock price and factors like short selling.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Do upvote if you liked the analysis.

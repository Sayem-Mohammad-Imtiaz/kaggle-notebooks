We'll describe what the data looks like and we'll try to find related columns:\n\nColumns of which I'm uncertain about their meaning:\n- **Color**: is the movie in color or black/white?\n- **num_critic_for_reviews**: probably has something to do with 'professional' reviews. \n- **num_user_for_reviews**: amount of user reviews?\n- **aspect_ratio**: the ratio in the screen?\n**num_voted_users**: the amount of imdb users that rated the movie?\n\n------------\nThe name of the director is mentioned, together with the amount of facebook likes the director has. This also holds for the three main actors in the movie. Also the amount of facebook likes the cast has is mentioned.\n\nThe duration of the movie is mentioned and so are the genre and the language. It might be important to find out whether the country refers to which country 'owns' the movie, or in which country it has been shot, my guess is the former.\n\nEvery movie of course has a budget and a revenue (gross). When analyzing these variables, take note of note 6 and 7 in the description. Currency and inflation haven't been taken into account.\n\nEvery movie has a year of release, an imdb score and a number of facebook-likes for the movie.\n\nAlso the amount of faces on the poster is mentioned, there are plot keywords and a link to the imdb page of the movie is provided.\n\n---------\n\nLet's divide these variables in categorical and numerical features:\n\n- **Categorical:** Color, Genres (because every movie contains multiple genres, this gives us MANY categories),\nlanguage and country. Aspect_ratio and content_rating can also be seen as categorical variables.\n- Note that Aspect_ratio and content_rating are a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types\n- **Continuous**:\n","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9697c9cd-1085-4bfa-b820-ef55646f32fd","_uuid":"ad6b16c77ba1466ac27885ccd91fccf4ecbe89f3"}},{"source":"Let's get more information about the dataframe by checking which columns contain null-values:","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"27505374-76ca-46d0-a088-8bf86c186a86","_uuid":"3489984b235e23d62d8c4b35ac1e1a599ef06233"}},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6514940e-3472-4978-9ba1-87dd26e5736a","_uuid":"5c155793e1f1716bfd2876f9fb3fef2f1f22f16c"},"source":"df.loc[:, imdb_df.isnull().any()].head()","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"source":"**So there are 21 out of 28 columns with null-values.**","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a636a043-5bc9-4215-b6ba-05edca69733f","_uuid":"def57cc90c1ce27553a19559099e229da166dcdf"}},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1da83184-a889-45d6-90c6-85e6d9a8a5de","_uuid":"8ed88409036e5a777d3107a5c477e1bb03268301"},"source":"(df.info())","cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"source":"So most of the variables which contain null values, only contain a few.

Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on oneâ€™s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:\n\n> Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.\n\n> Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.\n\n> Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.\n\n> X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.\n\n> **While we may know that certain items are frequently bought together, the question is, how do we uncover these associations?**\n\n*Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription.*\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What is Association Rule Learning?\n--\n\nAssociation Rule Learning is rule-based learning for identifying the association between different variables in a database. **`One of the best and most popular examples of Association Rule Learning is the Market Basket Analysis`**. The problem analyses the association between various items that has the highest probability of being bought together by a customer.\n\nFor example, the association rule, {onions, chicken masala} => {chicken} says that a person who has got both onions and chicken masala in his or her basket has a high probability of buying chicken also.\n\n\nApriori Algorithm\n--\n\nThe algorithm was first proposed in 1994 by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant. Apriori algorithm finds the most frequent itemsets or elements in a transaction database and identifies association rules between the items just like the above-mentioned example.\n\n\nHow Apriori works ?\n--\n\nTo construct association rules between elements or items, the algorithm considers 3 important factors which are, support, confidence and lift. Each of these factors is explained as follows:\n\n**Support:**\n\nThe support of item I is defined as the ratio between the number of transactions containing the item I by the total number of transactions expressed as :\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/403/0*pyOADkeaWyrVP2ft.png\" />\n\n<font color='darkgreen'><b>Support</b></font> indicates how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.\n\n<img src='https://annalyzin.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/association-rule-support-table.png?w=503&h=447' />\n\n<br />\n\n<font color='red'><em>If you discover that sales of items beyond a certain proportion tend to have a significant impact on your profits, you might consider using that proportion as your support threshold. You may then identify itemsets with support values above this threshold as significant itemsets.</em></font>\n\n\n**Confidence:**\n\nThis is measured by the proportion of transactions with item I1, in which item I2 also appears. The confidence between two items I1 and I2,  in a transaction is defined as the total number of transactions containing both items I1 and I2 divided by the total number of transactions containing I1. ( Assume I1 as X , I2 as Y )\n\n<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/576/1*50GI4dR58MnhwBP9dw6nFQ.png' />\n\n<font color='darkgreen'><b>Confidence</b></font> says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. In Table 1, the confidence of {apple -> beer} is 3 out of 4, or 75%.\n\n<img src='https://annalyzin.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/association-rule-confidence-eqn.png?w=527&h=77' />\n\n<font color='red'><em>One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the importance of an association. This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing apples will also contain beers, thus inflating the confidence measure. To account for the base popularity of both constituent items, we use a third measure called lift. </em></font>\n\n\n**Lift:**\n\nLift is the ratio between the confidence and support.\n\n<font color='darkgreen'><b>Lift</b></font> says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought. ( *here X represents apple and Y represents beer* )\n\n<img src='https://annalyzin.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/association-rule-lift-eqn.png?w=566&h=80' />\n\n<hr>\n\nfor **Extra Reading** : refer <a

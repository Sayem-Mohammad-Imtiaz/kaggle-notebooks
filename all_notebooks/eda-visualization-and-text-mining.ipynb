Looking at the word cloud of the second-level game name, the high-frequency words are \"Pokemon\", \"Mario\", \"Wii\", \"call\", \"duty\". The first two words are translated into Pokémon and Mario respectively, which are electronic Characters that often appear in games, and \"Wii\" as the name of the game platform, appears in the game name to indicate the Wii version of the game, and its high frequency is also understandable. But the remaining two words and the \"duck\" and \"blue\" in the third-level word cloud not only fail to understand the reason for their high frequencies from the meaning of the word alone, but they are also not proper nouns. I guess whether they are related to \"Pokemon\". \"The same is a special game IP, but after consulting, it is not found that these single words have the same name of the game IP. The author further guessed whether they may be IP formed by the combination of words, and the word segmentation operation separates the IP and cannot be found. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to verify this conjecture, the author selected all the words with a word frequency of more than 20, a total of 541 words, traversed the text database of the game name, and constructed a co-occurrence matrix in which two words appear in a game name at the same time. The elements of the co-occurrence matrix are $𝑋_{ij}$ Indicates the number of game titles that appear in the i-th term and the j-th term at the same time. Although the co-occurrence matrix can only count the frequency of two words appearing at the same time due to dimensional limitations, if the game IP name exceeds two words, the IP will also appear in the co-occurrence matrix through any two words in the complete IP name. Therefore, most IPs can be identified only by counting the collinear frequency of two words. After constructing the co-occurrence matrix, the co-occurrence frequency of \"call\" and \"duty\" is found to be the highest. If you search for these two words at the same time, you can find the famous IP \"call of duty\", which is successfully explained the reason for the higher frequency of \"call\" and \"duty\".

Based on the three levels of the game, it makes a multi-dimensional comparison of the different values of the above game attributes. After that, the market is segmented and analyzed whether different regional markets have different preferences for the attributes of video games. Finally, based on the idea of text analysis, text mining is performed on the game name. By studying the frequency of a single word and the co-occurrence matrix of two words, it is found that the game name usually involves the game IP. Brief analysis of the relationship between.

We spend so much time performing analysis, making complicated models and tuning parameters for neural networks.

In this notebook, we use only pandas to do quick analysis and address many 1st level questions to get a big picture about golden globe awards."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/golden-globe-awards/golden_globe_awards.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Look at data / General Description"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Types for each column\n\ndf.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# \"Film\" feature has some missing values\ndf.isnull().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fill missing film names with \"Unknown\"\ndf.film.fillna('Unknown', inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How many awards were given out each year?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"win_num_by_year = df[df.win==True].groupby('year_award').win.count().to_frame()\nwin_num_by_year","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It used to be less than 10 awards given in the first four years.

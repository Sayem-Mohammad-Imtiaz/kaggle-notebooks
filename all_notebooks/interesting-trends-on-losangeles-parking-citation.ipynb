People aren't fined within 10 minutes of the ticket expiring. Since Los Angeles is a business place, many employees and customers park their vehicles. This is also an excellent tourist place and therefore attracts large number of visitors. The parking violation can happen because many of them might be stuck at work or being in some place and that caused the delay.\n\nThere are also occasions where the rules are violated by parking in red zone (where no parking is allowed except buses and cars who can stop to pickup/drop the passengers). \n\nPreferrential parking violation is also one such type where the people have parked their vechicles in the residential area whose address  do not belong to two-block radius from the parking spot."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9914f23f1e2afd0448c2d5071695a05c1f3c94d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Top State Vehicle Number plates reported in Parking Citation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bc93a22612d95201348601bc546d00f183e79ce8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nstate_plate_count  = df['RP State Plate'].value_counts()\nstate_plate_count = state_plate_count[:5,]\nplt.figure(figsize=(11,8))\nsns.barplot(state_plate_count.index, state_plate_count.values, alpha=1,palette=(\"Paired\"))\nplt.title('Top 5 state Number plates were reported in Parking Citation', fontsize=22)\nplt.xlabel('Top State Number Plates', size=\"20\")\nplt.ylabel('Number of Occurrences', size=\"20\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9418f8c2d99e5bc8d44e620c70f60f6f9ff0cea0"},"cell_type":"raw","source":"California vehicle number plates tops the list with highest number of violations followed by Arizona (AZ), Texas (TX), Nevada (NV) and Florida (FL).

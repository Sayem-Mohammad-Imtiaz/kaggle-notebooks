that Online Classes are not Good Enough.\n\n\n- According to the basic analysis close to 50 % students think that they are utilising their time which is quite good.\n\n\n- We did quite a long analysis on Time Spend by students which mainly suggested that the timeline of students is distorted due to Covid-19 Pandemic and they are not able to enjoy their life as they would've if there was not pandemic.\n\n\n- We also found out that students are not being able to give time to studies neither online classes nor self-study.\n\n\n- Now in Social Media prespective we found that Instagram and WhatsApp are the most popular among Students which is quite expected and not that bizzare.\n\n\n- Due to pandemic majority of the students feel more connected to their family/close friends because lockdown has given them opportunity to spend quality time with them which was not that high during normal times.\n\n\n- According to the data Students are missing School and College the most (more than 30%). Morevover about 20% students are missing their families, friends and relatives, this suggests that many students are separated from their families, friends and relatives due to pandemic.\n\n\n- We Also found out that about 45% students reported no change in their weight whereas 37% reported a weight gain and 18% students reported weight loss.\n\n\n- Finally we infer that Music is the best Stress-Busters among students followed by Extra-Activities such as drawing, writing, sketching etc. and then Internet Surfing is third on list for entertainment sources, also Online Gaming have also gained popularity among students for beating stress.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

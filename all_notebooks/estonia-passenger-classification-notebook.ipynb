A Mayday signal was sent but power failure meant the ship’s position was given imprecisely. The Estonia disappeared from the responding ships’ radar screens at about 01:50.\n\nThe final death toll was shockingly high – more than 850 people.\n\nThe sinking of the Estonia was Europe’s worst postwar maritime disaster.\n\n## Problem Definition\n\nThe problem here will be Binary Classification, Given data about passeneger can we predict whether they lived or died\n\n## Data \nThe dataset contains the name, age, sex, category and fate of the 989 passengers aboard the Estonia on the night of the sinking.\n\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\n* Country - Country of origin\n* Firstname - Firstname of passenger\n* Lastname - Lastname of passenger\n* Sex - Gender of passenger - M = Male, F = Female\n* Age - Age of passenger\n* Category - The type of passenger - C = Crew, P = Passenger\n* Survived - 0 = No, 1 = Yes\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe death toll of the Estonia disaster is well above 80%. If we were to make a naive baseline classifier that simply assumed all passengers aboard the Estonia died, it would be right about 86% of the time. Can you make a more sophisticated classifier that beats the baseline?

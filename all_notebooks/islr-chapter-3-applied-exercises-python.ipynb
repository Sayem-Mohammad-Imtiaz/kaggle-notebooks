This is important because even though orthogonalizing the polynomials doesn't affect overall predictions the model will give, it reduces the correlation between the various powers of $X$ at the cost of sacrificing coefficient interpretability. Reducing the correlation between the powers improves our ability to interpret the t-statistics for each coeffiecient, because it alleviates the issue of multicollinearity.

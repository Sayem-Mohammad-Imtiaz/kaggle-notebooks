Check accuracy of model on validation data.\n2. Randomly shuffle a feature and put it back.\n3. Now again check accuracy of the model on that data.\n4. Compare it with the accuracy before shuffling.\n    * Decrease in accuracy will show importance of a feature.\n5. Now undo the shuffling of that feature and put it back. \n6. Repeat above process for every feature\n\n<h2>Advantages</h2>   \n* It does not require retraining  the model.\n* It automatically takes into account all interactions with other features. By permuting the feature you also destroy the interaction effects with other features. This means that the permutation feature importance takes into account both the main feature effect and the interaction effects on model performance.\n* It provides highly compressed, global insight into the model’s behavior.\n\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>   \n* It is linked to the error of the model. Therefore it is not useful when you want to check how robust is you model's output when you manipulate a feature. At that time you will not be interested in how much      model performance decreases when you permute a feature.\n* You need access to the true outcome. If someone only provides you with the model and unlabeled data but not the true outcome you cannot compute the permutation feature importance.\n\n* The permutation of features produces unlikely data instances when two or more features are correlated. When they are positively correlated (like height and weight of a person) and we shuffle one of the features, we create new instances that are unlikely or even physically impossible (2 meter person weighing 30 kg for example), yet I use these new instances to measure the importance. Therefore, If features are correlated, the permutation feature importance can be biased by unrealistic data instances.\n\n* It depends on shuffling the feature, which adds randomness to the measurement. When the permutation is repeated, the results might vary greatly. Repeating the permutation and averaging the importance measures over repetitions stabilizes the measure, but increases the time of computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"30a71b51e48abb526caf1fd1e2523d75c2bac9d7","_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#permutation importance\nimport eli5\nfrom eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance\n\nperm = PermutationImportance(clf_randomForest, random_state=1).fit(X_test, y_test)\neli5.show_weights(perm, feature_names = X_test.columns.tolist())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4df098774b6342479c196ce2e944437361ec25dd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Values towards top are most important and here it show that **thalach** (person's maximum heart rate achieved) and **ca** (number of magor vessels) are the two most important features.

We measure the amount of randomness in our permutation importance calculation by repeating the process with multiple shuffles. The number after the ± measures how performance varied from one-reshuffling to the next. There are also some negative values so what about them.

Then slightly increase the value of that feature and again note the accuracy of that row.\n1. Now we do the same above mentioned steps but on multiple rows and average of them is taken.\n1. Then we will plot the average predicted outcome on vertical axis.\n\n<h2>Advantages</h2>    \n\n* The computation of partial dependence plots is intuitive: The partial dependence function at a particular feature value represents the average prediction if we force all data points to assume that feature value. In my experience, lay people usually understand the idea of PDPs quickly.\n\n* In the uncorrelated case, the interpretation is clear: The partial dependence plot shows how the average prediction in your dataset changes when the j-th feature is changed.\n\n* Partial dependence plots are easy to implement.\n\n<h2>Disadvantages</h2>\n\n* The realistic maximum number of features in a partial dependence function is two. This is not the fault of PDPs, but of the 2-dimensional representation (paper or screen) and also of our inability to imagine more than 3 dimensions.    \n* The assumption of independence is the biggest issue with PD plots. It is assumed that the feature(s) for which the partial dependence is computed are not correlated with other features.\n\n* Some PD plots do not show the feature distribution.

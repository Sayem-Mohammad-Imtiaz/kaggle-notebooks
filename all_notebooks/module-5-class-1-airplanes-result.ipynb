This dataset is not well documented, but we'll assume that `*_x` corresponds to weather at the origin airport and `*_y` corresponds to weather at the destination airport. There is also information about flight delays and cancellations.\n\nOur goal is always to do something useful. Some useful things we could do with this dataset could be to gain insight into what conditions are related to delayed and canceled flights, and potentially predict or avoid those delays in the future, so we will explore the dataset with that goal in mind.\n\nFirst, we'll look into the frequency of delays and cancellations:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(df.arrival_delay > 0).sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(df.arrival_delay > 30).sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(df.arrival_delay > 60).sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(df.departure_delay > 0).sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"((df.arrival_delay > 0) & (df.departure_delay > 0)).sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.cancelled_code.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(df.cancelled_code != \"N\").sum() / df.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above, we can see that 34% of flight arrivals are delayed, 12% are delayed by more than 30 minutes, and 7% are delayed by more than one hour.

Hopefully the benefit of having a well-documented dataset is apparent here.)\n\nIf we assume that a cancelled code of \"N\" means not cancelled, and everything else is cancelled, then about 1.5% of flights are cancelled.\n\nWe can start out by looking at how conditions were different for flights that were canceled compared to other flights.

So we've found something that could be a predictor of flight cancelations, and we have also found some suspicious data points, which can be just as important. \n\nWhat should we do next? In groups, brainstorm and implement additional ways to explore this dataset. Some ideas:\n\n* Are flight delays or cancellations related to weather in ways other than the one we just looked at?\n* Are the related to certain days of the week or holidays etc?\n* Are delayed departures and delayed arrivals related to each other?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

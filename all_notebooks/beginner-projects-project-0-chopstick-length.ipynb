Based on the scatterplot created from the code above, interpret the relationship you see. What do you notice?\n - The relationship between chopstick length and average food-pinching efficiency appears to be parabolic (inverted). Efficiency for the examined data set starts around 25 PPPC at the 180mm chopstick length, begins to increase as chopstick length increases, reaches a peak around 26.5 PPPC at the 240mm chopstick length, then begins to decrease as chopstick length continues to increase, then ends around 24 PPPC at the 330mm chopstick length.\n\n\nIn the abstract the researchers stated that their results showed food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks, and that chopsticks of about 240 mm long were optimal for adults.\n\n7a. Based on the data you have analyzed, do you agree with the claim?\n - Based on the data analyzed so far, I can neither agree or disagree with the claim that food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks. I do agree that their results showed that the chopsticks of about 240mm length were optimal for adults.\n\n7b. Why?\n - The \"food-pinching performance was significantly affected by the length of the chopsticks\" claim cannot be determined with the data analyzed so far. To determine significance, hypothesis tests for the difference in means are required.\nThe \"chopsticks of about 240 mm long were optimal for adults\" claim is valid because they are simply stating what their results showed. A causal inference that 240 mm long chopsticks will be optimal for all adults cannot be made yet however. Again, this will require hypothesis tests - specifically a one-sided t-test where the hypotheses are:\nH0: μ240mm ≤ μz mm \nHA: μ240mm > μz mm \n\nwhere μ is the population mean food-pinching efficiency and z corresponds to the other chopstick lengths.","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"0293af51d843f193829c8a235e772d88b132e1d3"}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"aa40143c7bbec9ec8676f9b6abd52e52bd4cecac"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","file_extension":".py","nbconvert_exporter":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python","version":"3.6.0","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}}}}

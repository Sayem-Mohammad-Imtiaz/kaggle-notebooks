People who are suffering from heart diseases are known to demonstrate high blood pressure, lipids, glucose as well as obesity and overweight issues. The ability to identify these high risk factors will ensure that the patients receieve appropriate medical care and prevent premature deaths. \n\n## Understanding this study\nWe have the following information about our dataset:\n- Age\n- Sex: (1 = Male, 0 = Female)\n- cp(chest pain type): \n    * 1 = typical angina\n    * 2 = atypical angina\n    * 3 = non-anginal pain \n    * 4 = asymptomatic\n- trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n- chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n- fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)\n- restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results\n    * 0: Normal\n    * 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)\n    * 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria\n- thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved \n- exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n    * 1: Upsloping\n    * 2: Flat\n    * 3: Downsloping\n- ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n- thal: Thalium heart scan\n    * 3: Normal\n    * 6: Fixed defect\n    * 7: Reversable defect\n- target: Diagnosis of heart disease\n    * 1: Yes\n    * 0: No\n    \n## Objective\n- Find any correlations between attributes\n- Find correlations between each attribute and the diagnosis of heart disease"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First step is to import the required packages, namely numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport scipy.stats # Needed to compute statistics for categorical data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing dataset into notebook and have a preview.

While the Japanese leader once again seemed to be far ahead of the American firm, an announcement from Microsoft shook the video game planet on September 21, 2020: the purchase of Zenimax Media and its subsidiaries including Bethesda (The Elder Scrolls, Fallout ..), idSoftware (Doom, Quake ..) or MachineGames (Wolfenstein ..) for 7.5 billion dollars.**\n\n\n**This investment will allow Xbox to make all Zenimax games exclusive to their console. In other words, all players who want to play games from Zenimax studios will have to go through the Xbox service.**\n\n**Based on the sales of games on both consoles since 2013, we will see the impact this buyout would have had on the previous decade, which will tell us what the next could look like**.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" **Importing

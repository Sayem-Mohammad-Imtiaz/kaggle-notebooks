Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.\n\nCompanies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.\n\npredictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Library for DataFrame and Data manipulation\nimport pandas as pd\n# Matrix operations and statistical functions\nimport numpy as np\n# Plotting and dependency for seaborn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Graphs and chart used in this notebook\nimport seaborn as sns\n# to convert categorical values into numerical value\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n# these imports are self explanatory\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Understanding the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading Data from csv file\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Describe some stats of numerical features apperantly there should be  numerical features\ndata.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Describe data type of the features , or the type of value they contain\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# There are some missing values in 'TotalCharges' but insted of representing it by 'NAN' it represents it by blank space\ndata[data['TotalCharges']==' ']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Manipulation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# extracting index of rows where TotalCharges has a white space \nws = data[data['TotalCharges']==' '].index\n# removing all those rows whose index have been extracted just now\ndata.drop(ws,axis=0,inplace=True)\n# converting 'TotalCharges' data type from object to float, because it contains real values\ndata['TotalCharges'] = data.TotalCharges.astype('float')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# standardization , all values will me subtracted by column's mean and divided by cloumn's standard deviation\ndef standardized(data,col):\n    mean = data[col].mean()\n    std = data[col].std()\n    data[col] = (data[col]-mean)/std\n    \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this function is to plot countplot, since majority of features are categorical, i would stick to countplot most of the time\ndef plot_comparison(col,val,some=None):\n    sub_data = data[data[col]==val]\n    value = sub_data[sub_data['Churn']=='Yes']\n    print('In '+str(col)+' = '+str(val)+' , it is {:.2f} % likely that customer will leave'.format((len(value)/len(sub_data)*100)))\n    sns.countplot(sub_data['Churn'],palette=\"bright\",ax=some)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Visualization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Let's discuss the effect of some of the variables, that may help in churn prediction "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 0.

\n\nOn 20th February, mass infection occurred in a church.\n\nOn 19th March, the government started to restrict foreigners' entry.\n\nWe can see the confirmed people decreased and recovered people increased after that days.\n\nActually, the article says the restriction was not the best because Korea made entrants from Europe wait in hospitals, but there were over 1000 people coming and the beds were not enough, the government gave up and made them wait just at their home.\n\nNevertheless, it seemed to be effective to control infections according to this

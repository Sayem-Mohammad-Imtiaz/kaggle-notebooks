In simple terms, it tells us how much does one variable changes for a slight change in another variable. It may take positive, negative and zero values depending on the direction of the change. A high correlation value between a dependent variable and an independent variable indicates that the independent variable is of very high significance in determining the output. In a multiple regression setup where there are many factors, it is imperative to find the correlation between the dependent and all the independent variables to build a more viable model with higher accuracy. One must always remember that more number of features does not imply better accuracy. More features may lead to a decline in the accuracy if they contain any irrelevant features creating unrequired noise in our model.\n\n**Applications of a correlation matrix**\n\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix:\n\n1. To summarize a large amount of data where the goal is to see patterns. In our example above, the observable pattern is that all the variables highly correlate with each other.\n2. To input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\n3. As a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression, a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression estimates will be unreliable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Presentation**\n\nWhen presenting a correlation matrix, you'll need to consider various options including:\n\n1. Whether to show the whole matrix, as above or just the non-redundant bits, as below (arguably the 1.00 values in the main diagonal should also be removed).\n2. How to format the numbers (for example, best practice is to remove the 0s prior to the decimal places and decimal-align the numbers, as above, but this can be difficult to do in most software).\n3. Whether to show statistical significance (e.g., by color-coding cells red).\n4. Whether to color-code the values according to the correlation statistics (as shown below).\n5.

EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task.\nIt is always a good idea to explore a data set with multiple exploratory techniques, especially when they can be done together for comparison. The goal of exploratory data analysis is to obtain confidence in your data to a point where you’re ready to engage a machine learning algorithm. Another side benefit of EDA is to refine your selection of feature variables that will be used later for machine learning."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. Understanding the dataset\n\nTitle: Haberman’s Survival Data\nDescription: The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago’s Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.\nAttribute Information:\nAge of patient at the time of operation (numerical)\nPatient’s year of operation (year — 1900, numerical)\nNumber of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)\nSurvival status (class attribute) :\n1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer\n2 = the patient died within 5 years"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2.

In this analysis, I attempt to create a similar metric to measure Trump's Twitter anger, and determine if there is a correlation between Trump's anger online, and his approval rating. Finally, I will plot Trump's twitter anger by day and week of his presidency, and highlight key moments of his term to visualize any potential patterns.

[Choropleth Maps](https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/choropleth.html) display divided geographical areas or regions that are coloured, shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable. The data variable uses colour progression to represent itself in each region of the map. Typically, this can be a blending from one colour to another, a single hue progression, transparent to opaque, light to dark or an entire colour spectrum.\n\nFor these maps the latitude and longitude of the counties from the Covid-19 dataset isn't important because the only column required to map the cases is the 'fips' column.As a result, we can account for NY City by manually inputting its fips value. We could search the web for Kansas City's fips but I will ignore it.\n\nAlso unlike the heat maps, we do not need to restrict on the date when mapping since we won't be running into performance issues.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"density =  pd.read_csv(\"../input/us-counties-covid-19-dataset/us-counties.csv\", dtype={\"fips\": str})\ndensity = density.loc[density.date == density.date.max()]\nprint(\"NY City before update: \\n\" +str(density.loc[density['county'] == 'New York City'])+\"\\n\")\ndensity.loc[density['county'] == 'New York City','fips'] = 36061\nprint(\"NY City after update: \\n\" +str(density.loc[density['county'] == 'New York City'])+\"\\n\")\n#drop the rows with county = 'unknown' - these rows have no fips values\ndensity.dropna(how = 'any', inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With choropleth maps colour can only be assigned to a county if you have data on that county. Otherwise they will show as blank on the choropleth map. This is problematic because of the way the original Covid-19 dataset is set up. If a county has no recorded cases then it will not show up in the dataset. So we have to account for this in order to create a more wholistic choropleth map.\n\nTo do this I compared the unique counties in the Covid-19 dataset with the list of counties in the GeoDataFrame that we have been using up to this point. I used Excel to do this. Because both files using different naming conventions (e.g. one of the files uses \"borough\" in the county's name whereas the other didn't) it was hard to completely account for every missing county. Because of this there will be gaps in the maps produced below.\n\n\nI then added any counties that were 1) in the GeoDataFrame and 2) not in the Covid-19 dataset to a new dataset where I manually created the columns 'county', 'fips', 'cases' and 'deaths'. The columns 'cases' and 'deaths' were set to 0 for all counties in this new dataframe. As I will be trying to map the death rate (deaths/cases) I also created a new column here and not in excel called 'deathrate'. This column of course will be filled with NaN since 0 divided by 0 does not work. I therefore use fillna to replace these with 0.\n\nThis new dataset is then read and we take what we need depending on what we want to map.\n\n**The issue with this method is that you would have to periodically check that your list of counties with 0 cases to make sure it is up to date. If one of these counties records a case in the future and you keep your list as is then when you concatenate the US Covid-19 dataset with this dataset of counties with 0 cases you will have two rows (one with >0 cases recorded courtesy of the US Covid-19 dataset and one with 0 cases recorded courtesy of the manually created dataset) **\n\n**FYI there will still be gaps which will be represented by the colour white in the maps produced below**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"unrecorded =  pd.read_csv('../input/us-counties-without-recorded-casesdeaths/unrecorded_counties.csv')\n\nunrecorded_cases = unrecorded[['fips','county','cases']]\nunrecorded_deaths = unrecorded[['fips','county','deaths']]\n\nunrecorded_deathrate = unrecorded[['fips','county','cases','deaths']]\nunrecorded_deathrate['death_rate'] = (unrecorded_deathrate['deaths']/unrecorded_deathrate['cases']).fillna(0)\nunrecorded_deathrate = unrecorded_deathrate[['fips','county','death_rate']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As already said, the list of counties in the step above were not present in the initial US Covid-19 dataset.

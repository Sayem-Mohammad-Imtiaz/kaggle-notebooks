It causes political issues throughout the world. Some may see them only as peoples who settled other countries and fled the war. But tey are just seeking a safe place to live in. And some of them can not make it.\n\nMissing Migrants Project tracks deaths of migrants, including refugees and asylum-seekers, who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide. The research behind this project began with the October 2013 tragedies, when at least 368 individuals died in two shipwrecks near the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n\nThis dataset from International Organization for Migration (IOM) includes events during migration between January 2014 and March 2019 and it represents minimum estimates, as many deaths during migrations are unrecorded.

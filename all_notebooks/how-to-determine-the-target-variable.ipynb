{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The essence of the problem is as follows: there is a production of plastic film. Production itself is very common and looks relatively simple (google) - roughly speaking, propylene granules are poured, they are melted, pulled, assembled into a large cylinder (pictured in the attached documents) - rolled out, cut. A more detailed process of production is quite easy to find on the Internet.\n\nThe bottom line is that sometimes clippings of this film occur. I would like to investigate how these cliffs depend on the regime of production, on the recipes.\n\nThe link contains data from the extruder equipment - telemetry tags for the year. In the attachment is a description of these tags in Russian. The film breakage can be found by the tag “thickness” - (ST110_VAREx_0_SDickeIst)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas_profiling\nimport pandas_summary as ps\n\n# Data processing, metrics and modeling\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold, StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD, PCA\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\n# Lgbm\nimport lightgbm as lgb\n\n# Suppr warning\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# Plots\nimport matplotlib\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\n\n# Others\nimport shap\nimport datetime\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook\nimport sys\nimport pickle\nimport re\nimport json\nimport gc\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 5000)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)\npd.set_option('use_inf_as_na', True)\n\nwarnings.simplefilter('ignore')\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 100\nsns.set()\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"folder = '/kaggle/input/find-a-defect-in-the-production-extrusion-line/'\nstats_df = pd.read_csv(folder + 'stat.csv', sep=',')\nfull_df = pd.read_csv(folder + 'extrusion.csv', sep=',')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats_df.shape, full_df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_df.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_df['Datum'] = pd.to_datetime(full_df['Datum'])\nfull_df = full_df.reset_index()\nfull_df.index = full_df['Datum'] ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dfs = ps.DataFrameSummary(full_df)\ndfs.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Statistics of deficiency.

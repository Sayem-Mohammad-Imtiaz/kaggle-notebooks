As lymph fluid leaves the breast and eventually goes back into the bloodstream, the lymph nodes try to catch and trap cancer cells before they reach other parts of the body. Having cancer cells in the lymph nodes under your arm suggests an increased risk of the cancer spreading.In our data it is axillary nodes detected(0–52)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Haber_Data['Surv_status'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Okay!

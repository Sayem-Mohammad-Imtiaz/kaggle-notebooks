Sub-centres are the first contact point with the community, the success of any health programme at the grassroots level would depend largely on well functioning sub-centres providing minimum assured services to the people. Tasks assigned: Interpersonal communication to bring behavioural change, maternal and child health: immunization and other services, control of communicable diseases, etc. (Staff: One Male, Female Health Worker.)\n2. **<u>Primary Health Centre(PHC)</u>**: One PHC for 30000 population in plains and 20000 population in tribal, hilly & desert area. Located in rural and urban areas. PHCs are the first contact between the village community and the medical officer. The activities of PHC involve curative, preventive, promotive and family welfare service. The PHCs are established and maintained by the State governments. No. of HSCs under one PHC: 6. (4-6 Beds, 1 Medical Officer, 14 subordinate paramedical staff).\n3. **<u>Community Health Centre(CHC)</u>**: One CHC for a population of 120000 in plains and 80000 tribal, hilly & desert areas; may change norms depending on the circumstances. CHCs are established and maintained by the State Governments. No. of PHCs under one CHC: 4. (30 Beds; four medical specialists i.e. surgeon, physician, gynaecologist and paediatrician supported by 21 paramedical and other staff; diagnostic services.)\n4. **<u>Area hospitals</u>** (aka sub-district hospitals or divisional hospitals): Area hospitals are below the district and above the block level hospitals (CHC) and act as First Referral Units for the Tehsil/Taluk/block population in which they are geographically located and form an important link between Sub-centre, PHC and CHC on one end and District Hospitals on another end. They provide comprehensive care and also specialist service; helpful in reducing the workload of district hospitals. (31-100 Beds;  emergency obstetric care, neonatal care and help in bringing down the mortality rates (maternal and infant). Caters to population up to 5-600000.) \n5. **<u>District Hospitals</u>**:  An essential component of the district healthcare system; District Hospital is a hospital at the secondary referral level responsible for a district. Comprehensive secondary health care services. Every district is expected to have a district hospital and should aim to develop into super-speciality services. Caters to both rural and urban populations. (100 to 500 Beds)\n6. **<u>Teaching Colleges</u>**: TCs are associated with Medical Colleges and must fufil the criteria of having 750 beds and provision for additional beds depending on patient load. All the teaching hospitals shall be under the academic, administrative and disciplinary control of the Dean/ Principal/Director. In this Health Care System's hierarchy, Medical Colleges are on the top.\n7. **<u>First Referral Unit <i>(for further analysis)</i></u>**: An existing facility (District Hospital, Sub-divisional Hospital, Community Health Centre etc.) can be declared a fully operational First Referral Unit (FRU). Three critical determinants of a facility being declared as an FRU: i) Emergency Obstetric Care including surgical interventions like caesarean sections; ii) new-born care, and iii) blood storage facility on a 24-hour basis.\n\n**AYUSH Information** regarding Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani,  Siddha,  Homoeopathy and Sowa-Rigpa (AYUSH: translates to 'Age') constitute Indian System of Medicine. (The below definitions are taken from Ministry of AYUSH. For more detailed information, http://ayush.gov.in/about-the-systems) \n1. **Ayurveda** in totality means ‘Science of life’. It incorporates all aspects of life whether physical, psychological, spiritual or social.\n2. **Yoga** is a discipline to improve or develop one’s inherent power in a balanced manner. It offers the means to attain complete self-realization. The literal meaning of the Sanskrit word Yoga is ’Yoke’.\n3. **Naturopathy** is a system of a man building in harmony with the constructive principles of Nature on physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes of living. It has great health promotive, disease preventive and curative as well as restorative potential. Mahatma Gandhi was a follower of this system of medicine.\n4. The basic theory of **Unani** system is based upon the well- known four- humour theory of Hippocrates. This presupposes the presence, in the body, of four humours viz., blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. \n5. The term **Siddha** means achievements. The Siddha System is largely therapeutic in nature. Like Ayurveda, this system also considers the human body as a conglomeration of three humours, seven basic tissues and the waste products of the body such as faeces, urine and sweat. The equilibrium of humours is considered as health and its disturbance or imbalance leads to disease or sickness.\n6. **Homoeopathy** simply means treating diseases with remedies, prescribed in minute doses, which are capable of producing symptoms similar to the disease when taken by healthy people. It is based on the natural law of healing- \"Similia Similibus Curantur” which means \"likes are cured by likes”.\n7. **Sowa-Rigpa**(Science of Healing) commonly known as the Tibetan system of medicine is one of the oldest, living and well documented medical tradition of the world; associated with Buddhist culture. Bodies of all the living beings and non-living objects of the universe are composed of Jung-wa-nga; viz Sa, Chu, Me, Lung and Nam-kha (Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Sky). The medicine and diet used for the treatment of disorders are also composed of the same five basic elements. A physician, in treating a patient, uses the theory of similarity and dissimilarity of five elements.\n"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tgh","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"3\"></a>\n<h1>Statistical Summary and Analysis </h1>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tgh.describe(include = \"all\").T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**<font color = Blue> Analysis of the above cell (output): </font> <br>**\n\n1. **Mean** values show the average of all the values in the column.\n2. **Std** here refers to standard deviation. This measure shows how spread out the values are around the mean, a smaller std means the values are clustered around mean, meaning some uniformity in allocation or spread of the facilities. A std  of 'zero' would imply all the values are the same. However, <u>some major deviations here viz; Beds in all Hospitals, Doctors in all Hospitals, Health Sub-Centres and Primary Health Centres</u>.\n3. **Percentiles** show the relative standing of a value in comparison to the other data values. <u>Percentiles for Health Sub-Centres: 25% of the districts have lower than 109.5 centres, 50% (median) have lower than 151.0 centres, 75% have lower than 194.0 centres and the 100th percentile district has 257.0 centres. This is a good measure to observe inequality. For example, gaps between the 75th percentile and highest  viz., Doctors and Beds, i.e., few districts have a high majority of the doctors and beds.</u> Similar Trend can be observed for Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani, Naturopathy and Teaching Hospitals.\n4. **Min and Max** are the minimum and maximum of the values in the columns. For Example, in \"Beds in all Hospitals\" minimum number is 96 and the maximum is 5798. Similarly, \"Doctors in all hospitals\" column the minimum and maximum are 20 and 1168 in number. <u>A great gap between districts</u>. Although, here, it is appropriate to analyse these measures along with population density. \n5. Minimum Values of 'Zero' exist for Community Health Centres, Area Hospitals, District Hospitals, Teaching Hospitals, Naturopathy Hospitals (incl. Dispensaries) which means there are districts that do not have the mentioned facilities (or infrastructure).\n<br>\n\n**Disclaimer**:<br>\n*a) The contents below are for national standards, while this EDA is for a state in India. <br>\nb) The dataset contains information about government hospitals only (i.e., does not include any information regarding non-government, trust, charity, private hospitals, etc. in the state). <br>\nc) 21 Districts were newly carved out of the old 10 to create 31 districts for better administritation at the end of 2016.

At present, there are only 0.65 doctors, 1.3 nurses and 1.3 hospital beds per 1,000 people in India. The desired requirement by 2034 for every 1,000 people is 2.5 doctors, five nurses and 3.5 beds. To achieve this standard an investment of around $245 billion would be required.\n2. According to WHO standards, a minimum of 3 beds per 1000 is required. But India aspires at least to achieve 2 beds per 1000, which translates 2.623 million beds over the course of next decade, which includes both replacement and new beds. *[source: economictimes, date: Feb 22, 2018]*\n3.

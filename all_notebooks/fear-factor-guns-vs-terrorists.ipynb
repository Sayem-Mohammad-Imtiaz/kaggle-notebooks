When we were done he said, “Well as crazy as it is here I’d take this any day over what you’re dealing with.”  \n\nI was a bit confused, and asked what disaster he was referring to.  He clarified, “No, I mean all of the terrorists driving trucks into crowds and setting off bombs on trains and stuff.”\n\nAh, right.  I’ve heard similar statements several times since I moved to Europe and never quite understood them - after all, while horrific, I was pretty confident that the probability of being a victim of a terrorist is far lower than many other forms of violent crime or preventable death.  I replied, “You know, there are more gun deaths each day in the US than terrorism deaths in Europe every year.  What you should be afraid of is walking out your door.”\n\nNot surprisingly, we agreed to disagree and the conversation ended cordially.  However, it got me thinking: was I right?  Is someone in Europe more at risk from an Islamic (or other radical) terrorist than an American is from another American with a gun?  If not, why the the fear?\n\nThe first question sounded like a straightforward data analytics exercise, so I busted out a Jupyter notebook to explore, grabbed some data and challenged the hypothesis.\n\nTo analyze terrorism I chose the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD), a very comprehensive collection of worldwide terrorism over the last half century. The gun violence datasets were harder to come by, in part due to the successful lobbying efforts by the National Rifle Association (NRA) which blocks government research on gun violence, so I chose to work with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Multiple Causes of Mortality dataset which classifies all deaths in the US, including deaths by firearms. The latest year that the GTD and CDC set fully overlap is 2015, so I chose that as the year to focus on.\n","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"a8b642a30928d650ef97b0053279f4d52455865f","_cell_guid":"6767e5d7-55d4-4a69-af13-a92319314e64"}},{"source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport json as json","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"a83772e72f4ede14d2da59a4735e0fc6f3d87ae6","_kg_hide-input":true,"_cell_guid":"0d1eceb0-86dc-407f-a9aa-5b860aea211d","collapsed":true},"execution_count":2},{"source":"us_population = 323100000.0 # Wikipedia 2016\neu_population = 743000000.0 # Wikipedia 2016\nus_eu_pop_ratio = us_population/eu_population\none_million = 1000000","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"fcbf2fdaf8945f018611afbe2a798c6a2443bd60","_cell_guid":"03a44951-c714-48f2-b712-001f2103ee3b","collapsed":true},"execution_count":3},{"source":"# Terrorism","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"601ae431c0ecdd370daf2d9e19427a647c6623c5","_cell_guid":"28af2b27-b0b8-46c0-9d32-e7518cee89d7"}},{"source":"Let’s start by looking at terrorism.

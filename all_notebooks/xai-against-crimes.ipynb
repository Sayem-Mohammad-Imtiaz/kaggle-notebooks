In my experience and as I have been reading, over-sampling usually works better since for undersampling we are losing a portion of real data which is valuable and nothing interesting is in losing data. For oversampling, there are several methods such as ROSE or SMOTH. I've found SMOTE more accurate and robust. So let's see what will happen after oversampling our data.\n\nNOTE: Running code below might take several hours, in case you need to run it."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"041165102488eb42076fa41674d6e03e766060fa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import recall_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import precision_score\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(crimes.loc[:, crimes.columns != 'Primary_Type_Num'], crimes['Primary_Type_Num'], test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)\n\nprint(X_train.shape,y_train.shape,'before')\nsm = SMOTE(random_state=2)\nX_train_res, y_train_res = sm.fit_sample(X_train, y_train.ravel())\nprint(X_train_res.shape,y_train_res.shape,'after')\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(max_features=\"log2\", max_depth=20, n_estimators=25,\n                             min_samples_split=600, oob_score=False,n_jobs=4).fit(X_train_res,y_train_res.ravel())\ny = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n\n\n\nprint(recall_score(y,y_test, average='micro'))\nprint(recall_score(y,y_test, average='macro'))\nprint(recall_score(y,y_test, average='weighted'))\n\nprint(precision_score(y,y_test, average='micro'))\nprint(precision_score(y,y_test, average='macro'))\nprint(precision_score(y,y_test, average='weighted'))\n\nprint(f1_score(y,y_test, average='micro'))\nprint(f1_score(y,y_test, average='macro'))\nprint(f1_score(y,y_test, average='weighted'))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9579113adc6bdf616ba78855e4ee8d963d3f4239"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Great! So the first point is that before oversampling we had around 5 million rows of data, but after that around 35 Million! After training our model we can see our Micro score has been decreased by about 7% but on the other hand our Macro score has been improved significantly. Based on precision, recall or F-1 score our Macro score has been improved from 15% to 30% which is pretty good. It means that even for classes that have a very low number of samples we can predict with a reasonable percentage. So based on what we need from our data, lower false positives or false negatives we can use either of those.

We are training them all over the places and make our decisions based on those models. When it comes to sensitive data and decisions people need to know why this model is saying what is trying to say. They need to know what are factors that have been affected this model to tell us, for example, this person is eligible for getting a loan or not. \n\nThat was when this concern raised in different communities and they have decided to pass new roles for using machine learning algorithms. Something like GDPR which is mostly the right to be informed about the decision and they were supposed to start the needed structure for doing so in Europe in 2018. \n\nSo these algorithms are becoming more and more like black boxes that we have no or little idea what's going on in them.

So they offered an algorithm which LIME and the way it works is that basically, it tries to find boundaries by sampling instances. So like the image below, it tries to find out why this model decided to set bold red + as a red class base on its training. We can see that this model is pretty complex and those boundaries cannot be well explained with a linear model. Now, what LIME is doing is that it tries to samples points around the specific data we are looking for and then base on distribution and distances between that point and they try to explain why we classified this as to be red. So, for example, some of those points are closer so they are bolder and so on. Another factor that this model is considering is that how much it is interpretable for a human. \n\nAfter making different experiments on different dataset they found interesting results. For example, they tried to see what's the reason that an image classification would say about wolves and huskies. Without XAI system, we are getting high accuracy but when they try to look at the decision boundaries it was pretty disappointing. Sometimes the model tries to classify images as wolves just because there is a snow background in it. Definitely, it has some relation to that but we know that is not a reliable factor. So after using LIME they were showing that for example to classify a Labrador with a guitar which is pretty hard for computers to recognize different things in it, it can pretty well explain what is going on in this image. We might get lower accuracy for our classification or regression but we would know why the model is doing this and it would be more reliable in terms of human interaction.\n\nAnother interesting paper from those is (3), so the method they explained is anchors and how they can be a very high-precision method to explain machine learning algorithms. So the idea behind anchor is basically what causality is about. We try to see what are things that when we know they are happening can affect our decision boundaries to decide which class this record needs to belong to. We would try to define a threshold for that as hyper-parameter. Later they did interesting experiments on POS tagging and household dataset. For example in the image below, Anchor is trying to explain why it has been classifying those instances into different classes. It tries to show us what are important things that affected the model at that specific point."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"bcb4340e0af698fd2545cfc0fcc680d08f42331b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(filename='house.png')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe48cd1c96be7fc1f7aae3d7127a4bf6c7e2770f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another evidence that we need XAI platforms as they discussed in (1) is Christianity/Atheism text classification. Base on different algorithms such SVM they were getting high accuracy in terms of classification, but after taking closer look into the model, they realized that words like “Posting”, “Host” and “Re” are things that classifier are looking for them to base on presence  or lack of that decide what class this text belongs to. Things that are not a good metric( not any relation between them to either Christianity or Atheism) for classifying.  \n\nSo after testing on different datasets and considering both how people think that's interpretable and accuracy of the model they have summarized the results of LIME and Anchor into the table below."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"3f5c2b2cb977c488adcf4760b686a4ac90e7c23f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(filename='final.png')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"49ebc9733f961a2dc11c9b8a74aea199eed3305e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So precision and time are pretty obvious but there is another factor which is coverage. It is something that tries to explain how this model could explain its behavior based on our feature set on all over data. Unclear coverage can lead to low human precision and they might think that insight from an explanation can be applied to unseen samples even when it does not. \n\nBase on different parameters such as Time, precision and coverage we can see that the anchor model is performing better than LIME. Does that mean LIME simply doesn't work? Well, the short answer is it depends. So, for example, the household income dataset has a lot of features and when it comes to using Anchor method it can give us a lot of boundaries that it's thinking is responsible for its action at that point. The result of that would be low coverage and interpretability of unseen data. On the other hand, LIME is trying to give us lower predictions and simpler ones, that would be something more appealing to users. In the below image we can see that Anchor is giving a lot of factors, but LIME is trying to give less!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"0cfdb715c9a1d7a0e9fcee3cc7e22ff0d9c92c38"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(filename='anchor.png')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dd9bc7b8d99b736929288ab8b61e2a2b65ae2504"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These were pretty much a general understanding of myself about these methods.

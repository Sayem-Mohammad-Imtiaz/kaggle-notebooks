Introduction \n\nCOVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The first infected case has been identified at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly outspread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by a global pandemic.\n\nTo intensify the global actions needed to prevent and slow down transmission of COVID-19, scientists from different countries have achieved an astounding scientific accomplishment by development of several safe and effective vaccines within less than a year after this virus was isolated and sequenced.\n\nBy the end of 2020, more than 30 million vaccine doses have already been administered (WHO, 2021),however,the global vaccine rollout has exposed glaring inequalities in access to this life-saving tool."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

Discussion & Conclusion"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### With the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating effects, COVID-19 vaccine has become a life-saving tool. Despite the clinical success, there has been an increasing concern about inequalities in vaccines distribution. The aim of this project has therefore been to assess the key factors that affect COVID-19 global distribution. In particular,this work seeks to address if politics, economy, or/and demograghy have an impact of vaccines access. By employing the standard approach of data science and machine learning, with in-deep analysis of the data being provided and added, this study provided an important insights into the influencing factors of COVID-19 global distribution.\n\n#### In this analysis study, comparing the total given vaccinated among world regions showed that there has been so far unfair  allocation for administered vaccines. The most interesting finding was the huge observed gap, for example,the whole Africa people have administered **less than 1%** , while, Northen America people accounted nearly **40% of the total world vaccinations.**\n\n#### Geologically,results of our analysis concluded that **the people of Europe and Northen America have been proven to be the most likely to be fully-vaccinated with a percentage ranges from 15 to 51%, where, African people collectively are less likely with a percentage of 1%.** In other words,considering the same daily vaccinations rate and assuming the typical vaccinations of 2 dose, we can estimate that Europe and Northen America people will be fully vaccinated by March 2022, in contrast, the estimation date of African people to get fully vaccinated will be 2037.\n\n#### There are,however, several explanations for thess unanticipated findings. It could be concluded from our demographical,economical, and political analysis that significant inequalities in vaccines access could be attributed to many factors. In conclusion, **people more likely to be vaccinated are the people who come from countries of:**\n\n### * Higher in CPI score.\n### * Higher in health total expenditure (% of GDP).\n### * Higher in GDP per capita.\n### * Approved-vaccine developer.\n\n#### The main findinds from our correlation analysis, was the significant positive correlation betweenthe CPI score and total vaccinations for a given country. this main finding further supports what has been mentioned by Transparency International Organisation that **(The  corruption undermines the global health response to COVID-19)**.\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

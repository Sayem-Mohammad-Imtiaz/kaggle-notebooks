Please feel free to comment, like, and share feedback! Here were the instructions:**\n\nData Analysis and Writing Test (total estimated time: 2 hours)\n\nYou have 24 hours to complete this assignment. The 24-hour countdown begins after this\ndocument and associated data file are sent to you.\nSend the three outputs (data script, plot of data and short writing up) directly to xxx.\n\nThere are two elements to this test (A and B) which are explained below:\n\n**A) Data Analysis** <br>\nObjective: Using the data provided, generate a data visualization in a scripting language of\nyour choice (e.g., R, Python, SAS, Stata, etc.)\n\nDeliverable:\n> a) script file containing all loading, processing and export steps (e.g., *.do, *.r, *.py, etc.)\n\nTime Allotment: A maximum of one (1) hour <br>\nDetailed Instructions:\n- Generate a **line plot** of the **annual employment growth rate** (i.e., year-over-year percent\nchanges) from **January 2007** to the most recent data point available (November 2019)\nfor the following **two provinces**: Alberta and Ontario\n- All data manipulations and calculation of variables must be done in the scripting\nlanguage of choice. No changes should be made to the data in the CSV file prior to\nloading it into your data environment\n- The final script should show all steps in the process:\nloading the data, manipulating the data and calculating required variables, generating the plot, and exporting the plot image. Including explanatory comments within the script is recommended, but not required.\n\n**B) Writing Assignment** <br>\nObjective: Write a blog post for a non-technical external audience explaining the most salient patterns shown in the data visualization produced in part A of this test.\n\nDeliverable:\n> a) MS Word file with a draft blog post\n\nTime Allotment: A maximum of one (1) hour. <br>\nDetailed Instructions:\n- Describe the patterns observed in the plot generated, and provide some explanation as\nto why the employment growth rates in the 2 provinces move together or diverge during\nthe past 13 years\n- The blog post can be written in the language of your choice (English or French) (If written in English, the blog should be between 200 and 500 words in length, if written in French, the blog should be between 300 and 800 words in length)\n- Formatting of the text in the Word document does not matter."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**A) DATA

ASSIGNMENT**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Ontario sees hike in employment rate in 2019 while Alberta declines**\n<br> 9 November 2019\n\nA recent study by the Labour Market Information Council (LMIC) comparing annual employment growth rates in the last 13 years shows that Ontario and Alberta see similar fluctuations in the rate of employment, but it is Alberta that experiences these fluctuations more severely. However, since the start of 2019 the two provinces have diverged with Ontario experiencing a hike of 2.89% in employment growth and Alberta declining by 0.14%. \n\nIn recent previous years, there were commonalities in the fluctuations of the rate of employment between the two provinces. For example, both provinces experienced a drop and rise in employment rates during the recession and recovery of the economic crisis which began in 2007. An interesting finding is that employment rate fluctuates much more drastically for Alberta than Ontario. The standard deviation in the change of employment rate for Alberta is 1.87% compared to 1.21% for Ontario which means that on average, Alberta’s employment rate deviates from the norm more so than Ontario’s. \n\nIn 2019, Statistics Canada estimated that employment in Alberta in natural resources declined by 9.9%. So, although trends in employment rate for Ontario and Alberta tend to move together, why do they fluctuate at different accords? How do each of these provinces act and react to shifting national and international environments?\n\nThe study conducted by LMIC was all-inclusive of specifications such as full-time and part-time employment amongst both males and females. Further studies could extract insights from these differing groups and include sector-specific data so to look more into the types and conditions of employment rate growth in Ontario and Alberta."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

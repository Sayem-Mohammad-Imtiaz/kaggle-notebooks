( i.e. the ability of a classification model to identify only the relevant data points)\n\n> *precision = number of true positives / n true positives + n false positives*\n\n\n- **Recall**: the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. ( i.e. the ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within a dataset )\n\n> *recall = number of true positives / n  true positives + n false negatives*\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg)\n\n\ne.g. When a search engine returns 30 pages only 20 of which were relevant while failing to return 40 additional relevant pages, its precision is 20/30 = 2/3 while its recall is 20/60 = 1/3. So, in this case, precision is \"how useful the search results are\", and recall is \"how complete the results are\".\n\n\n- In cases where we want to find an optimal blend of precision and recall we can combine the two of them in what is called an **F1 score**. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall taking both metrics into account in the following equation:\n\n> *F1 = 2 x ( precision x recall ) / precision + recall *\n\nIts better to use the F1 score instead of a normal average because this way we punish the extreme values.

We can recommend to the NYC city council to provide additional education activities in midtown Manhattan as it is signifacntly has less activities than other districes in the city and has a relativly high crime rate.\n3. Additional recommendation about enforcment, first of all using the heat-map created police may be able to map POI in the city and provide more manpower to those areas. \nThe police could use the suggester model to recieve hints about future locations of crimes and the profile of the future criminal teenager. \n4.

A user earns 750 * (effective watching time / video length) energy points after watching a video. (Effective watching time for a 10-minute video at 2X speed will be only 5-minute)\n2. A user earns a base of 75 energy points after completing an exercise at <font color='red'>level</font> 0.\n3. This might increase to at most 225 due to fast answering speed or repeated correct attempts.\n4. The points earned will decrease to as few as 5 as the user's <font color='red'>level</font> of that exercise increase to encourage the user to practice other exercises.\n5. Users will earn points from badges, which encourage students to keep learning and complete certain targets to earn the different badges.\n\n![能量點數說明:習題](https://help.junyiacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/learn_4.png)\n![能量點數說明:影片](https://help.junyiacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/learn_5.png)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is <font color='red'>level</font> ([Proficiency mechanism](https://help.junyiacademy.org/home/badge_learning/))?\n\n\"*Proficiency mechanism*\" allows students to convert short-term memory into long-term memory through appropriate and repeated review. <br>\nIt also helps teachers and parents to use the least amount of time to confirm whether the children's learning is proficient. <br>\n\nThere are five possible levels, all users start from level 0 and progress to level 4 which we considered Proficient for that exercise. <br>\nThe rules are as the following for each exercise:\n\n1. Every user starts at level 0.\n<br>\n<br>\n2. To reach level 1, the user will have to answer the problems correctly 5 times in the recent 6 problems in the exercise.\n<br>\n<br>\n3. To reach next level, the user needs to wait some hours, which will be longer if user is at higher level, and will answer 2 problems from the exercise. For example, the user is at level 2 and get a chance to answer 2 problems:<br>\n    *  If <font color='red'>both are correct</font>, the user is <font color='red'>upgraded</font> to level 3.<br>\n    *  If <font color='red'>both are incorrect</font>, the user is <font color='red'>downgraded</font> to level 1.<br>\n    *  If one of them is correct and one of them is incorrect, the level is <font color='red'>unchanged</font> and the user is prompted to try again the challenge.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.

After reaching <font color='blue'>level 1</font>, the user is required to wait <font color='blue'>6 hours</font> before he/she is able to attempt to level up again to level 2.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.

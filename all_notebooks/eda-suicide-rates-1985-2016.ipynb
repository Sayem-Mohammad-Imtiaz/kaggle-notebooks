It would be more reasonable to talk about shared values of some regions like Europe, where countries show similar tendencies. \n\nThe dramatic growth of suicide numbers was in the end of 1980 - 1995 and most of the countries that took first places are former Soviet Union countries, so we can cnclude that the system collapse reflected on local societies and led to increasing of suicides. However, they demonstrate a trend of decreasing those numbers after year 1995.\n\nAsian countries like Japan and Korea are showing dangerous trend - increasing suicide numbers in the last years.\n\nAfrican countries are very unstable, it's hard to predict how will suicide rate change in the next few years.\n\nThat is why the first graph of total suicide numbers demonstrates relative stability within 2000-2014 and another peak in 2015.

We\nwill train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new\ncelebrities after showing it pictures of many real celebrities. Most of\nthe code here is from the dcgan implementation in\n`pytorch/examples <https://github.com/pytorch/examples>`__, and this\ndocument will give a thorough explanation of the implementation and shed\nlight on how and why this model works. But don’t worry, no prior\nknowledge of GANs is required, but it may require a first-timer to spend\nsome time reasoning about what is actually happening under the hood.\nAlso, for the sake of time it will help to have a GPU, or two. Lets\nstart from the beginning.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\n-------------------------------\n\nWhat is a GAN?\n-----------\n\nGANs are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training data’s distribution so we can generate new data from that same distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first described in the paper [Generative Adversarial\nNets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf). They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a *discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the\ndiscriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the generator output is real or fake.\n\nNow, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting with the discriminator. Let $x$ be data representing an image. $D(x)$ is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar) probability that $x$ came from training data rather than the generator. Here, since we are dealing with images the input to $D(x)$ is an image of HWC size 3x64x64. Intuitively, $D(x)$\nshould be HIGH when $x$ comes from training data and LOW when $x$ comes from the generator. $D(x)$ can also be thought of\nas a traditional binary classifier.\n\nFor the generator’s notation, let $z$ be a latent space vector sampled from a standard normal distribution. $G(z)$ represents the\ngenerator function which maps the latent vector $z$ to data-space. The goal of $G$ is to estimate the distribution that the training data comes from ($p_{data}$) so it can generate fake samples from that estimated distribution ($p_g$).\n\nSo, $D(G(z))$ is the probability (scalar) that the output of the generator $G$ is a real image. As described in `Goodfellow’s\npaper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`, $D$ and $G$ play a minimax game in which $D$ tries to\nmaximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes ($logD(x)$), and $G$ tries to minimize the probability that\n$D$ will predict its outputs are fake ($log(1-D(G(x)))$). From the paper, the GAN loss function is\n\n\\begin{align}\\underset{G}{\\text{min}} \\underset{D}{\\text{max}}V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim p_{data}(x)}\\big[logD(x)\\big] + \\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim p_{z}(z)}\\big[log(1-D(G(x)))\\big]\\end{align}\n\nIn theory, the solution to this minimax game is where $p_g = p_{data}$, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the inputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is still being actively researched and in reality models do not always train to this point.\n\nWhat is a DCGAN?\n----------------\n\nA DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by Radford et. al. in the paper [Unsupervised Representation Learning With Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf). The discriminator is made up of strided `convolution  <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Conv2d>`layers, `batch norm <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d>`layers, and `LeakyReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LeakyReLU>`activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a\nscalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution. The generator is comprised of\n`convolutional-transpose <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d>` layers, batch norm layers, and\n`ReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#relu>` activations. The input is a latent vector, $z$, that is drawn from a standard normal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which will be explained in the coming sections.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from __future__ import print_function\n#%matplotlib inline\nimport argparse\nimport os\nimport random\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.parallel\nimport torch.backends.cudnn as cudnn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torch.utils.data\nimport torchvision.datasets as dset\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torchvision.utils as vutils\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\n# Set random seem for reproducibility\nmanualSeed = 999\n#manualSeed = random.randint(1, 10000) # use if you want new results\nprint(\"Random Seed: \", manualSeed)\nrandom.seed(manualSeed)\ntorch.manual_seed(manualSeed)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Inputs\n------\n\nLet’s define some inputs for the run:\n\n-  **dataroot** - the path to the root of the dataset folder.

These\nlabels will be used when calculating the losses of $D$ and\n$G$, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN\npaper.

Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art\nform, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with\nlittle explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow\nAlgorithm 1 from Goodfellow’s paper, while abiding by some of the best\npractices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.\nNamely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”\nimages, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize\n$logD(G(z))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1\nupdates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n\n**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n\nRecall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\nprobability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\nterms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending\nits stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize\n$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\nsuggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\nwill construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\npass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\ncalculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\na batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\nbatch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\nand *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\ngradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\ncall a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.\n\n**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n\nAs stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\nminimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\nAs mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\ngradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\ninstead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\nthis by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\nDiscriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\nG’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters\nwith an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\nlabels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\npart) which is exactly what we want.\n\nFinally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\nepoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\nvisually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics\nreported are:\n\n-  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for\n   the all real and all fake batches ($log(D(x)) + log(D(G(z)))$).\n-  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n-  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator\n   for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then\n   theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why\n   this is.\n-  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n   The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n   after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to\n   0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.\n\n**Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you\nrun and if you removed some data from the dataset.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training Loop\n\n# Lists to keep track of progress\nimg_list = []\nG_losses = []\nD_losses = []\niters = 0\n\nprint(\"Starting Training Loop...\")\n# For each epoch\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # For each batch in the dataloader\n    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader, 0):\n        \n        ############################\n        # (1) Update D network: maximize log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))\n        ###########################\n        ## Train with all-real batch\n        netD.zero_grad()\n        # Format batch\n        real_cpu = data[0].to(device)\n        b_size = real_cpu.size(0)\n        label = torch.full((b_size,), real_label, device=device)\n        # Forward pass real batch through D\n        output = netD(real_cpu).view(-1)\n        # Calculate loss on all-real batch\n        errD_real = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate gradients for D in backward pass\n        errD_real.backward()\n        D_x = output.mean().item()\n\n        ## Train with all-fake batch\n        # Generate batch of latent vectors\n        noise = torch.randn(b_size, nz, 1, 1, device=device)\n        # Generate fake image batch with G\n        fake = netG(noise)\n        label.fill_(fake_label)\n        # Classify all fake batch with D\n        output = netD(fake.detach()).view(-1)\n        # Calculate D's loss on the all-fake batch\n        errD_fake = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate the gradients for this batch\n        errD_fake.backward()\n        D_G_z1 = output.mean().item()\n        # Add the gradients from the all-real and all-fake batches\n        errD = errD_real + errD_fake\n        # Update D\n        optimizerD.step()\n\n        ############################\n        # (2) Update G network: maximize log(D(G(z)))\n        ###########################\n        netG.zero_grad()\n        label.fill_(real_label)  # fake labels are real for generator cost\n        # Since we just updated D, perform another forward pass of all-fake batch through D\n        output = netD(fake).view(-1)\n        # Calculate G's loss based on this output\n        errG = criterion(output, label)\n        # Calculate gradients for G\n        errG.backward()\n        D_G_z2 = output.mean().item()\n        # Update G\n        optimizerG.step()\n        \n        # Output training stats\n        if i % 50 == 0:\n            print('[%d/%d][%d/%d]\\tLoss_D: %.4f\\tLoss_G: %.4f\\tD(x): %.4f\\tD(G(z)): %.4f / %.4f'\n                  % (epoch, num_epochs, i, len(dataloader),\n                     errD.item(), errG.item(), D_x, D_G_z1, D_G_z2))\n        \n        # Save Losses for plotting later\n        G_losses.append(errG.item())\n        D_losses.append(errD.item())\n        \n        # Check how the generator is doing by saving G's output on fixed_noise\n        if (iters % 500 == 0) or ((epoch == num_epochs-1) and (i == len(dataloader)-1)):\n            with torch.no_grad():\n                fake = netG(fixed_noise).detach().cpu()\n            img_list.append(vutils.make_grid(fake, padding=2, normalize=True))\n            \n        iters += 1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nplt.title(\"Generator and Discriminator Loss During Training\")\nplt.plot(G_losses,label=\"G\")\nplt.plot(D_losses,label=\"D\")\nplt.xlabel(\"iterations\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Loss\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#%%capture\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nims = [[plt.imshow(np.transpose(i,(1,2,0)), animated=True)] for i in img_list]\nani = animation.ArtistAnimation(fig, ims, interval=1000, repeat_delay=1000, blit=True)\n\nHTML(ani.to_jshtml())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

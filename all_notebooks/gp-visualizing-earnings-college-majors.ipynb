The original data can be found from [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) which conducts surveys and forms aggregate data. The file we will be using comes from FiveThirtyEight, the dataset has been cleaned and released on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).\n\n### Quick Description of Columns\n\n- **Rank** - Rank by median earnings (the dataset is ordered by this column).\n- **Major_code** - Major code.\n- **Major** - Major description.\n- **Major_category** - Category of major.\n- **Total** - Total number of people with major.\n- **Sample_size** - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time.\n- **Men** - Male graduates.\n- **Women** - Female graduates.\n- **ShareWomen** - Women as share of total.\n- **Employed** - Number employed.\n- **Median** - Median salary of full-time, year-round workers.\n- **Low_wage_jobs** - Number in low-wage service jobs.\n- **Full_time** - Number employed 35 hours or more.\n- **Part_time** - Number employed less than 35 hours.\n\n### Project Goals\n\nThe goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Pandas's and matplotlibs plot functionality. In other words, showing fundamentals in visualizing a dataset and its insights."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#matplotlib magic code\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#import matplotlib \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n#testing if matplotlib import\n\nplt.plot()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import the dataset \nrecent_grads = pd.read_csv('../input/college-earnings-by-major/recent-grads.csv')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#exploring the recent_grads dataset\nprint(recent_grads.iloc[0])\nprint(recent_grads.head())\nprint(recent_grads.tail())\nprint(recent_grads.describe())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#find the number of rows in the dataset\nraw_data_count = recent_grads.shape[0]\n\n#drop missing na values and asign back to dataframe\nrecent_grads = recent_grads.dropna()\n\ncleaned_data_count = recent_grads.shape[0]\n\nprint('The number of rows before drop na function is ' + str(raw_data_count))\nprint('The number of rows after the drop na function is ' + str(cleaned_data_count))\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exploration\n\nWe will use the graphs below to answer two qestions\n\n1.

First, we must find what are the most popular majors within the dataset and add context by connecting it to median pay. Looking at the top ten most popular and least popular majors will give us a sneak peek into what majors make more money.  Once we have created a variable with those results we can start to visualize the results by constructing a bar plot with an x-axis pertaining to majors and the y-axis as media pay. Lastly, we can increase our understanding of the top ten variable by averaging out the median pay for the top ten most popular majors and the top ten least popular majors.\n\n\n- **Conclusion:** Students in more popular majors do not make more money on average, this might indicate that the major itself is what influences the median pay."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#find the top ten most popular majors and their median pay\npop_major = recent_grads[['Total','Major','Median']].sort_values(by = 'Total' , ascending = False).head(10)\npop_major","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Find the top ten least popular major and their median pay\nunpop_major = recent_grads[['Total','Major','Median']].sort_values(by = 'Total' , ascending = True).head(10)\nunpop_major","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Graph top ten most favorite and top ten least favorite\npop_major.plot.bar(x = 'Major', y = 'Median')\nunpop_major.plot.bar(x = 'Major', y = 'Median')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('The average median pay for the top ten most popular majors is ' + str(pop_major['Median'].mean()) + '\\n')\nprint('The average median pay for top ten most unpopular majors is ' + str(unpop_major['Median'].mean()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Question 2\n\n- **Question:** Do students that majored in subjects that were majority female make more money?\n\n- **Aproach:** To answer this question we must go through a multi step process of data filtering and checking.\n    1. create boolean variable that filteres whether pop of Female is greater than Male.\n    2.

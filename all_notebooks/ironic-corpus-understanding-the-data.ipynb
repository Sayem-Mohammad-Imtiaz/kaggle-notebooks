We’d be best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in.” The Death Eaters is actually an evil group bent on killing Harry Potter. \nHarry Potter, \n\nJ.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\n\nThe data presented in this corpus concerns [_irony_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Verbal_irony), which is a statement produced with one meaning, but the intended meaning is the opposite. That is, a literal interpretation of the statement will produce the opposite meaning of what the statement is trying to convey. For example, a person who has burned a meal might serve it and say ironically \"it's a little underdone.\"\n\nAlthought there are [different types of irony](http://typesofirony.com/), this dataset concerns _verbal irony_. A feature of verbal irony is that it is used intentionally to mean something other than what is said.\n\nOnline comments are a ripe place for irony. \n\nThis makes irony detection a difficult problem because a surface interpretation of a sentence can produce an opposite meaning that what was intended. In natural language processing, automatic verbal irony detection has been treated as a text classification problem, but with some approaches specific to irony.\n\nThe creators of the dataset used here, claim that context is important in detecting irony. They claim that humans often need context to determine irony, and therefore computers probably also need context. \n\nThe paper was published in 201\n\n### What is the goal?\n\nThe _Ironic Corpus_, [first presented in 2014](http://www.byronwallace.com/static/articles/wallace-irony-acl-2014.pdf), is set up as a binary classification problem. The dataset contains 1950 comments (taken from [reddit](www.reddit.com), which were rated as (1) containing irony, or (-1) not containing irony.\n\nThis data is relevant, because it was taken from a source known to inspire ironic comments. However, the data set was purposely created to be ambigious.\n\nIn the paper, the authors use an SVM model with five-fold cross-validation to detect irony. They present their results with the F1 score, precision and recall. For preceision and recall, scores close to 1 are best. F1 is the harmoic mean between the two.\n- average [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score): 0.383 (range 0.330 - 0.412)\n- average [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall): 0.496 (range 0.446 - 0.548)\n- average [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall): 0.315 (range 0.261 - 0.380)\n\nBefore trying to improve or reporoduce these results, this notebook performs some basic exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the corpus.

An LSTM is a specific type of RNN and is used in a lot of commercial applications(Siri), also consider GRU's, which can occasionally outperform LSTMs on certain tasks and ther are more advanced models as well (like Attention, BERT, 1D Convolutions, Capsules, etc).\n\n### Below is an illustration of an RNN Style Architecture\n#### For each timestep you have some data that's input `x` and an activation `A`, which outputs a new state `h`, the important thing about RNN and LSTM's is that the state information from prior states is used as input to the next state, which means that the model builds a state vector overtime that incporporates prior information. This improves upon the bag-of-words models that are used in classical ML, which are word/token based and don't normally incorporate the context that words are used in (e.g. \"the leaves are orange in fall\" vs \"he often leaves from work at noon\"). This was addressed through n-gram based models, but the exponential increase in input data makes such models intractable in most applications.\n\n![LSTM Drawing](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/img/RNN-unrolled.png)\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1e65d1f444285f3b502c376e589763598834fe06"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Below is a quick method used to train the models"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"437586a63cf712839aeb370764a83c4f5cc0e7e7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndef threshold_search(y_true, y_proba, average = None):\n    best_threshold = 0\n    best_score = 0\n    for threshold in [i * 0.01 for i in range(100)]:\n        score = f1_score(y_true=y_true, y_pred=y_proba > threshold, average=average)\n        if score > best_score:\n            best_threshold = threshold\n            best_score = score\n    search_result = {'threshold': best_threshold, 'f1': best_score}\n    return search_result\n\n\ndef train(model, \n          X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, \n          checkpoint_path='model.hdf5', \n          epcohs = 25, \n          batch_size = DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE, \n          class_weights = None, \n          fit_verbose=2,\n          print_summary = True\n         ):\n    m = model()\n    if print_summary:\n        print(m.summary())\n    m.fit(\n        X_train, \n        y_train, \n        #this is bad practice using test data for validation, in a real case would use a seperate validation set\n        validation_data=(X_test, y_test),  \n        epochs=epcohs, \n        batch_size=batch_size,\n        class_weight=class_weights,\n         #saves the most accurate model, usually you would save the one with the lowest loss\n        callbacks= [\n            ModelCheckpoint(checkpoint_path, monitor='val_acc', verbose=1, save_best_only=True),\n            EarlyStopping(patience = 2)\n        ],\n        verbose=fit_verbose\n    ) \n    print(\"\\n\\n****************************\\n\\n\")\n    print('Loading Best Model...')\n    m.load_weights(checkpoint_path)\n    predictions = m.predict(X_test, verbose=1)\n    print('Validation Loss:', log_loss(y_test, predictions))\n    print('Test Accuracy', (predictions.argmax(axis = 1) == y_test.argmax(axis = 1)).mean())\n    print('F1 Score:', f1_score(y_test.argmax(axis = 1), predictions.argmax(axis = 1), average='weighted'))\n    plot_confusion_matrix(y_test.argmax(axis = 1), predictions.argmax(axis = 1), classes=encoder.classes_)\n    plt.show()    \n    return m #returns best performing model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"76f3ab74fae28e6bbe3f2ebed6aaca0fc7eeed8c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Important Note, when Evaluating Models - Look at Loss not Accuracy....\n\n### For each model we'll produces several stats, including the Accuracy and F1, and Loss on the Validation Set.

Next Steps\n----\n\n### The final model approaches an Accuracy/F1 of 70 - 71%(almost 10% improvement in F1 from our baseline) and it seems like there might be a bit of plateau caused in-part by the amiguity of the data. So now that learning has plateau'd there are still some areas to explore to further improve on our model.\n1. Hyperparameter Tuning - Batch Size, DropOut Rate, LSTM Size, etc.\n2. Try to generate/collect new data to help with performance (translation augmentation is one technique). \n3. Perform Threshold Search to see if that can improve the accuracy of the model, by changing the decision threshold for classifcation (default is 0.5). Usually good for a small \"free\" boost.\n4. Consider adding meta-data(likes, retweets, num followers) or additional statistical feature e.g. Count of Punctuation, Count all CAPS words, etc.\n5. Use cross validation to analyze architecture. In this example I mostly just did one pass on a give model, to see what choices would make the greatest impact, but when fine-tuning a model it's often helpful to use 10-Fold Cross Validation to confirm if the architectural change produces a statistically significant imrpovement, especiially when considering using the models in a commercial setting where cost would be a factor.\n6. Start Exploring more complex architectures to get an additional edge, sinc deep learning is an evolving field it's always good to keep reading and learning new techniques, which seem to get better every 2-3 months."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"984543c487e63e75dc894eed03bb037f81db8f71"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# [Winning architecture for Quora Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/discussion/80568)\n![Imaget](https://i.imgur.com/zUY9tVN.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d1682458f8b8d0b44140fd30bba4f7ab226ae3b5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# [KD Nuggets Benchmarking RNNs to Machine Learning Based Approaches](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/07/overview-benchmark-deep-learning-models-text-classification.html)\n\n![Image From KD Nuggets](https://ahmedbesbes.com/images/article_5/rnn_cnn_model.png)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6640b9c7ecdc3bafa89322da0067d114d170848e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

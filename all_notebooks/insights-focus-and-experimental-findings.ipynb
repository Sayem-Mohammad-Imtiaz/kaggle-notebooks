We shall attempt to do that in a subsequent notebook. \nOne interesting observation we make is the use of certain phrases to convey the fact that there were some findings from these experiments and procedures. \nIt would be helpful to be able to extract these automatically from the abstracts. Let's take the same example above and try to grab such claims from the text.\n\nFor this expriment, we will need to pivot on a word.

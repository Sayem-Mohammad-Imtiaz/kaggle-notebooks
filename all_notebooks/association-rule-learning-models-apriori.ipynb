Finally, the lift of 4.84 tells us that chicken is 4.84 times more likely to be bought by the customers who buy light cream compared to the default likelihood of the sale of chicken.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df.nlargest(n=10,columns=\"Lift\") # n parameter determines how many rows we want to get, \n                                    # columns parameter determines which will be based to organize data\n#we list the our data according to the LiftColumn","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.306037Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.306396Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.326942Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.306363Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.325989Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df.nlargest(n=10,columns=\"Confidence\") #Now we list the our data according to the Confidence Column\n# This means that if a customer buy a tomato sauce, the posibility ot buy ground beef is %37","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.328549Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.328928Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.347627Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.328883Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-21T15:11:31.346988Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"blue\">\nNow we will change some parameters","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model2= apriori(transactions=products, # This represents list of string of my products to work on\n              min_support= 0.004, # This represents minimum support of relations\n              min_confidence= 0.5, # This represents minimum confidence of relations\n              min_lift=3, # This represents minimum lift of relations\n              min_length = 2 , # This represents minimum length of the relation\n              max_length = 3 ) # This represents maximum length of the relation","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-21T16:33:29.788409Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-21T16:33:29.788781Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-21T16:33:29.792563Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-21T16:33:29.788747Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-21T16:33:29.791815Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"results2 = list(model2)\nresults2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-21T16:33:31.736594Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-21T16:33:31.738571Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-21T16:33:32.408122Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-21T16:33:31.738526Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-21T16:33:32.406962Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

Do not get me wrong, always from an analytical and social perspective, I am not in favor of these acts. Even though, I always consdiered it is an interesting aspect of our society that requires attention and further analysis, as I believe that, by observing them, we can obtain many relevant keys about our socio-economic situation, which if we take care of, they could help to construct a better place for everyone.\n\nI am also very found of fiction, specially cinema and series. As you may gess from before, I love mistery, crimes and complex stories that, somehow, reflect how we really are as human beings. One show that really outstanded me was The Wire (first emitted in HBO 2002), written by David Simon (who also has published several fictional novels on the topic). This series had a surprising impact on me, as it taught me that, although it is a work of fiction, it is possible to portray a social trend and certain groups through its narrative. In the case of this series, the main plot ended up practically in the background to portray the city of Baltimore at the beginning of the 2000s, with the different social classes and behavors that composited it.\n\nHowever, as realistic as it may be, fiction is sometimes too wedded to its status to allow itself to exaggerate about what it describes. Or is it? Well, this is the reason why we are here. In this notebook, we are going to work about this topic. By data analysis means, we are going to explore and analyze a nearly decade of arrests and crimes in a specific USA city and try to dive into the most interesting topics that we can find within it. By the end of this work, we will discuss on how fiction can really protray a real situation based on this exploration.

It is therefore logical to think that, for example, the economic situation (to some extent determined by the borough in which they live) where the young people are located is much more decisive than whether the students in question have dropped out of school. Therefore, we can attribute the phenomenon of delinquency in young people (and in adults as well) to, fundamentally, poverty and the resources they have available to survive.

On the other hand, we conducted a small investigation on whether there is a relationship between juvenile delinquency, which is higher than the average delinquency separated by age groups, and school dropout. We have concluded that, although it does have some influence over a period of about two years, it is not the main cause of young people being forced to commit crime. In fact, we came to the conclusion, from all that we have studied in the work, that poverty is probably the main reason why people are motivated to commit crimes, which seems obvious, since it is after all a question of survival in many cases. \nEven though, the general line of this work was to observe with data whether what we often know through fiction is real or not. The answer is a resounding yes. \n\nObviously, we have not rediscovered the wheel, as we have researched into the veracity of a literary genre known as the non-fiction narrative, where a fictional story is set in a real environment in order to anonymously describe the atmosphere and social situation in a certain place at a certain time. The Wire, one of the fathers of this genre, for example, is a story that grew out of several reports and journalistic investigations by its author, David Simon, in The Sun newspaper in Baltimore in the 2000s. Despite this fact, I think it was worth checking with data whether this is real, since it has also been interesting for us to observe different characteristics of crime in a city, as well as confirming that, in this case, fiction is terrifyingly close to reality.\n\nThis work raises other topics that would be treated within a predictive analysis of the dataset, such as the paradigm proposed in the third season of the cited show, where a police officer decides to create Hamsterdam, a fictitious neighbourhood where drug dealing is compeletelly legal, in order to reduce violence and street crime in normal neighbourhoods. Based on this premise, we could study, through population simulation, criminality data, and predictive models, whether this measure would be really effective in a city with large numbers of drug-related crime, such as the one we have just studied. It could be interesting in terms of bringing to the table information and possible solutions to improve citizen coexistence in relation to drug trafficking.

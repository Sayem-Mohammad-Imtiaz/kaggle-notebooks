How we think of these names changes over time though, along with how open parents are to giving their children gender-neutral names in the first place. We're going to dig into the numbers here and see if anything interesting comes up.\n\nI'm defining 'gender ambiguity' here as in the first script below: a number between 0 and 1 that describes how hard it is to guess a person's gender from the name alone. 0 means everybody with that name has the same gender, 1 means exactly 50% of people with that name have each gender. It's just double the probability you'd guess gender wrong from the name alone (which of course only goes up to 0.5).\n\nNote that the dataset is very definitive and binary about genders, so I'm following those simplifying assumptions here (sorry).\n\n**Also, I'm not super familiar with Pandas, so I'd love any suggestions or pointers to improve this!**"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ff48ef76-5fba-5040-5eeb-82af196e3fdb"},"outputs":[],"source":"import math\nimport pandas as pd\n\nnames_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/NationalNames.csv\")\n\nfrequent_names = names_data[names_data['Count'] > 20]\nindexed_names = frequent_names.set_index(['Year', 'Name'])['Count']\n\n# Number between 0 and 1 representing ambiguity, from certain to totally ambiguous\n# 0 = all the same gender, 1 = exactly 50% of each gender.

If anybody wants to send me (here or on twitter: @pimterry) a good way to add labels to lines, or a different way to portray this, that would be great!\n\nInteresting points though: 'Willie' has been around for a long time, was once a very unisex name, and became steadily more male for 100 years (but has now basically disappeared). 'Ashley'5 appeared suddenly as a unisex option in 60s, and then settled towards being predominantly female over 25 years or so.\n\nGeneral pattern in a lot of these is names starting off less gender specific, and becoming more gendered over time. 'Ryan' is the one obvious counter-example in the names shown here: it appeared in the 70s, all male, and is slowly but steadily moving in the other direction."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5af95505-65c9-e40e-648f-3a112b4b586e"},"outputs":[],"source":"ambiguous_names = data_vs_years[(data_vs_years['Ambiguity'] > 0.1).any(axis=1)]\npopular_ambiguous_names = ambiguous_names.sort_values(by='Total', ascending=False).head(7).drop(\"Total\", axis=1)\npopular_ambiguous_names['Ambiguity'].transpose().plot(figsize=(10, 10))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c80424ba-843e-7a56-e977-b8e38cab22df"},"source":"# How gender-ambiguous are the names used each year?\n\nThis is the simplistic measure: what's the average gender ambiguity, just of the names used each year?\n\nNote that this doesn't weight by how much those names are used - that's the next chart.

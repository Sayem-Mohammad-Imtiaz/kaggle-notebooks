Can you think of better visualization methods? \n* Can you visualize rare languages on a map? Each data point has a latitude and longitude location. You can use circle diameter to represent the number of speakers of each rare language. Where are most rare languages located? Where did the extinct languages die out?\n* We saw above that Romani is spoken in over 200 countries. Which rare languages are spoken in the most number of countries? Can you hypothesize why? \n* Which rare languages are more isolated (Southern Italian and Sicilian, for example) vs. more spread out? \n* Can you compare the number of rare speakers with more relatable figures? For example, are there more Romani speakers in the world than there are residents in a small city in the United States?"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

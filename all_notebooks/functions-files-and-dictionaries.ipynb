If you want to do the same set of operations more than once, you should consider making a function.\n\nThe syntax for a **function** is:\n    \n    def function_name(arguments):\n        # code here\n        return values\n        \nFunctions are the **building blocks** of programs - think of them as basic units that are given a certain input an accomplish a certain task. Over time, you can build up more complex programs while preserving readability.\n\nSimilarly to ``if`` statements and ``for`` and ``while`` loops, indentation is very important because it shows where the function starts and ends.\n\n**Note**: it is a common convention to always use lowercase names for functions.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def jorge_the_goose():    # Define a function that takes no arguments, and returns no values\n    print(\"Honk\")\n    print(\"bite\")\n\njorge_the_goose()\n\nprint(\"Here's a loop calling our function:\")\nfor i in range(3):\n    jorge_the_goose()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A function can take many arguments...","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def add(a,b): # a and b are 'arguments'\n    return a+b\n\nprint(add(2,4))\nprint(add(1.,3.2))\nprint(add(4,3.))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"and return many values...","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def double_and_halve(value):\n    return value * 2., value / 2. # The comma separates the two values returned\n                                  # These are returned as a `tuple` â€“ list whose length and values cannot be changed (immutable)\n\nprint(double_and_halve(9))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d, h = double_and_halve(5.) # In this case, we capture the two outputs in two separate variables using a comma\n\nprint(d)\n\nprint(h)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Functions can also \"call\" other functions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def do_a():\n    print(\"doing A\")\n    \ndef do_b():\n    print(\"doing B\")\n    \ndef do_a_and_b():\n    do_a()\n    do_b()\n    \ndo_a_and_b()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 1\n\nDiscussion: Think back to your homework from last night.

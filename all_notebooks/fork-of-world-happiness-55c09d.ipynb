The Greatest Factor that affects Happiness Score is GDP per capita,\n2. Our origial assumption which claimed that Regions were the greatest factor \nin Happiness was actually disporved which is seen in the Variable importance Graph\n3. Although the importance of the Regions werent deemed high, if we still train a \nmodel with the Regions as the factors, we still get an accuracy of 87.66% and a \ncorrelation of 0.796 between predicted and testing variables, \n\n4. Most suprising factor of all is that from the Features importance graph that we\n    have,we can see the Economy is the greatest motivator of happiness while Freedom\n    and Corruption perception arent that important which leads us to conclude that even\n    a corrupt country can have a very happy population as long as GDP per Capita\n    is high enough.\n5. Whoever said money can't buy happiness should have looked at this analysis before\n    making that assumption.\n\n\nHOW THIS ANALYSIS HELPS THE WORLD:\n\nUsing this analysis of world happiness, People could determine what factors are important\nto have the highest percieved happiness. Countries and leaders could determine what factors\nshould be taken into consideration when making decisons.\n\nFor example:\n    The Candian Federal Government is in a dilemma regarding the Trans American Pipline\n    which is a major pipline from Canada to the United States and generates a large amount\n    of income i.e GDP for the Candian people. At the same time the First Nations tribes \n    claim that the Trans Mountain Pipeline violates their rights to their soverign land i.e \n    their freedom. Using the Conclusions that we have found in our data analysis the Canadian\n    federal government can easily come to the conclusion with a very high confidenc that \n    if The Trans Mountain pipeline makes enough money, they can easily subvert the freedom of the First Nations people \n    and still keep a mojority of its citizens as happy or even happier and they are less likey to be voted\n    out during elections\n\n'''\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

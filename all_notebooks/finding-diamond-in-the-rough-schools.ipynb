Since a major part of PASSNYC's mission is to identify such \"diamonds in the rough,\" I decided to bring a data-oriented approach to this topic.\n\nMy hypothesis is that students with strong Common Core test scores will be easiest to convert into SHSAT test takers and to receive offers. Their existing academic ability means they'll be especially receptive to awareness outreach and convert to Elite High School offers with minimal mentoring or SHSAT-specific test prep from PASSNYC's partners.\n\nApart from the school explorer data, I also used the following data to build my solution:\n* *nyc-shsat-test-results-2017* to measure SHSAT offers\n* *ny-school-demographics-and-accountability-snapshot* from Socrata NYC Open Data  for enrollment information\n* *ny-2010-2016-school-safety-report* from Socrata NYC Open Data for crime statistics and to measure distances from the middle schools to the elite high schools."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e921566e691c1d9398b20b520eee19a0dee78e1a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Results\nI find that Common Core results and attendance are the best ways to identify schools that should recieve many SHSAT high school offers. \n\nAnd I found dozens of schools with these positive characteristics yet did not receive a single offer to a specialized high school in 2017.  These 30 schools are generally made up of the underrepresented populations that PASSNYC wants to help.\n\nThe top 30 most promising schools are displayed in a table at the very bottom of this report, with the full detailed rankings of all 580 schools saved to a csv file.\n\nSurprisingly, neither crime statistics nor distance to the specialized schools had any impact on whether a school's students received offers.\n"},{"metadata":{"nbpresent":{"id":"99df6df6-9f1e-40f8-bc96-2359fd9d63a2"},"_uuid":"a2af4e124eb7d4e014a4c998248e72a2bdad84db"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n### My solution has two steps:   \n\n**Part I** takes this forum post from Max B of PASSNYC as a starting point:\n\n*\"The hypothesis is that using what we know about students/schools who do take the test, we can find similar students/schools and rank them on their likelihood/opportunity of converting into test-takers\"*\n\nI use machine learning to find the relationship between school characteristics and SHSAT offers per student. Comparing  actual SHSAT offers per student with the model's expectations gives a  over or underperformance, and schools that are doing worse than they should be are ripe for outreach.  \n\n**Part II** specifically addresses this portion of the PASSNYC Challenge problem statement: \n\n*\"The best solutions will enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and underserved students stand to gain the most from services\"*\n\nI created an *attractiveness score* for each school in the data set, ** _that PASSNYC can adapt to match their goals_ ** based on each school's share of the groups in PASSNYC's mission (for example the economically disadvanted, minorities, or SHSAT nonfeeder schools). The score can be changed with user input from PASSNYC, depending on which groups they want to emphasize for a particulat type of outreach.\n\n** Putting it all together** by using over / underperform rankings in conjuction with the adaptable attractiveness score, schools can be quickly sorted and filtered by ** _both_ untapped academic potential _and_ alignment with PASSNYC's mission**.  \n"},{"metadata":{"nbpresent":{"id":"ec107492-397d-4b46-af38-973c71f0c3be"},"_uuid":"193bdfe8228009fcb8329a8b31bdfe5263e07f80"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Prep\nThe following couple sections of data prep can be skipped if you're here for high level results only.

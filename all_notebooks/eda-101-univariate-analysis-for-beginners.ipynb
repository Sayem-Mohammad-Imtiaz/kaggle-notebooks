Introduction to problem statement:\nA Bank wants to take care of customer retention for their product; savings accounts. The bank wants you to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance. You have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank. Your task as a data scientist would be to predict the propensity to churn for each customer.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Hypothesis Generation for the problem statement:\n**Hypothesis generation is about preparing an exhaustive list of questions or possibilities which directly or indirectly affect the problem statement or the target variablw. It is a very important step as it prevents us from going down for a wild goose chase during EDA. It narrows down the process of performing EDA to the most essential aspects.**\n\n**This step is performed before looking/gathering dataset**\n\nTo generate hypothesis, we require the following:\n1. Common Sense or Rationality\n2. Domain knowledge if possible\n3. Communication with domain experts\n\nGiven below are the hypothesis we will be working with in this EDA\n\n**On basis of Demographics**\n1. Are females less likely to churn than males?\n2. Are young customers more likely to churn?\n3. Are customers in the lower income bracket more likely to churn?\n4. Are customers with dependent(s) less likely to churn?\n5. Customers with an average family size less than 4 are more likely to churn?\n\n**On the basis of customer behaviour**\n1. Are vintage customers less likely to churn?\n2. Are customers with higher average balance less likely to churn?\n3. Are customers dropping monthly balance highly likely to churn?\n4. Are customers with no transaction is the last 3 months more likely to churn?\n5. Are customers who have large withdrawal amounts in the last month more likely to churn?\n6. Are customers who have large withdrawal amounts in the last quarter more likely to churn?\n7.

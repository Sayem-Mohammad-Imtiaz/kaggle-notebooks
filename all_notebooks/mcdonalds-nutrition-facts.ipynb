He wanted to serve burgers, buns, fries and beverages that tasted just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together with McDonald’s. Many of McDonald’s most famous menu items – like the Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish, and Egg McMuffin – were created by franchisees.\n\n##### Content\nThis dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.\n\n##### Acknowledgement\nThe menu items and nutrition facts were scraped from the McDonald's website.\n\n##### Inspiration\nHow many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value? What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs? What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Business Understanding\n##### Problem: \nRay Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of preparation with this McD Dataset.\n##### Clear Questions: \n- a) How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?\n- b) How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake?\n- c) Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value?\n- d) What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs?\n- e) What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?\n\n##### Analytic Approach: \nI think we just need to do descriptive analysis by using charts to solve this problem.\n\n##### Data Requirements / Features: \n- a) Item, Calories\n- b) Category, Item\n- c) Item, Calories, Protein, Fat\n- d) Item, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat\n- e) Cholesterol, Saturated Fat, Sodium, Trans Fat"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Understanding"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/nutrition-facts/menu.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check statistical information\ndf.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check the column, null count, and its dtype\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#check missing data\ndf.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preparation"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# rename the column names\n# df.columns = ['Category', 'Item', 'Serving Size', 'Calories', 'CaloriesFat', 'TotalFat','TotalFatPercent', 'SaturatedFat','SaturatedFatPercent','TransFat','Cholesterol','CholesterolPercent','Sodium','SodiumPercent','Carbo','CarboPercentage','DietaryFiber','DietaryFiberPercent','Sugars','Protein','VitAPercent','VitCPercent','CalciumPercent','IronPercent']\n\n# but since, we already map the data requirements, we knew what columns is needed, so i skip the renaming column names since it's optional","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# map the data according to the data requirement\ndf = df[['Category', 'Item', 'Calories','Protein','Total Fat','Saturated Fat','Carbohydrates','Trans Fat','Cholesterol','Sodium']]\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"text-align:center;\"> After doing this, I think the data is already cleaned by default, so we can start the descriptive analysis without any further preparation </p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- -->"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question A\na) How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# i. average calories for the whole menus\ndf[\"Calories\"].mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ii. average calories for each items\n\nmeals = df.head(110) # All meals (without drinks) are in first 110 rows of the dataset\nmeals_cal = pd.DataFrame({'Item': meals.Item, 'Calories': meals.Calories}) # Select only Items and Calories columns\nmeals_sort = meals_cal.sort_values('Calories', ascending=False) # Sort by calories\nmeals_sort.plot.barh(x='Item', y='Calories', color=\"green\", figsize= (10,45)) # Plot horizontal bar\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion A\n- i.

In this case we will use the labels to try to get an idea of how well the algorithm performed, but you won't usually do this for Kmeans, so the classification report and confusion matrix at the end of this project, don't truly make sense in a real world setting!.\n___\n\n## The Data\n\nWe will use a data frame with 777 observations on the following 18 variables.\n* Private A factor with levels No and Yes indicating private or public university\n* Apps Number of applications received\n* Accept Number of applications accepted\n* Enroll Number of new students enrolled\n* Top10perc Pct. new students from top 10% of H.S. class\n* Top25perc Pct. new students from top 25% of H.S. class\n* F.Undergrad Number of fulltime undergraduates\n* P.Undergrad Number of parttime undergraduates\n* Outstate Out-of-state tuition\n* Room.Board Room and board costs\n* Books Estimated book costs\n* Personal Estimated personal spending\n* PhD Pct. of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s\n* Terminal Pct. of faculty with terminal degree\n* S.F.Ratio Student/faculty ratio\n* perc.alumni Pct. alumni who donate\n* Expend Instructional expenditure per student\n* Grad.Rate Graduation rate","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Libraries\n\n** Import the libraries you usually use for data analysis.**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get the Data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"** Read in the College_Data file using read_csv.

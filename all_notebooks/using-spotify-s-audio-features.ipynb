Introducing a \"score\" metric to boost tracks that come from the same Spotify playlist as one of your liked songs from the train set\n- Using more complex models, such as neural networks using keras

tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-spotify-streaming-history-with-python-d5a208bbcbd3#:~:text=Getting%20the%20data,but%20it's%20usually%20much%20faster) to get you started with creating your app at the Spotify developers website. Didn't follow all of it, since some of the spotipy code is deprecated, but this guide was great at helping me set up my Spotify developers account and app.\n- Once you have an app running, you should plug you client secret and user to this code and be good to go! Be sure to check [Spotipy's documentation](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/) if there's something unclear.\n- This code accesses your music library **Playlist wise**, so be sure any song you want to actually access is in one of your playlists.\n- Would recommend running this with a debugger if confused, as the Json structure of this is quite trippy, but your mileage may vary.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Helper function:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"'''def create_music_dataset(playlists, sp,k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function\n    :param playlists- playlists to draw tracks from\n    :param sp - spotipy object to manage stuff\n    :k - constant to determine how many songs I want to scrape from each playlist.\n    100 songs per k\n    :returns a song list along with their audio features\n    \"\"\"\n    track_art_names = []\n    while playlists:\n        for i, playlist in enumerate(playlists['items']):\n            print(\"%4d %s\" % (i + 1 + playlists['offset'], playlist['name']))\n            for j in range(k):\n                playlist_tracks = sp.playlist_items(playlist['id'], offset=j * 100)\n                items = playlist_tracks['items']\n                for item in items:\n                    track = item['track']\n                    try:\n                        artist_name = track['artists'][0]['name']\n                        artist_id = track['artists'][0]['id']\n                        track_name = track['name']\n                        orig_playlist = playlist['name']\n                        track_art_names.append((artist_name, track_name, artist_id,orig_playlist))\n                    except:\n                        print(\"Playlist Error\")\n                        continue\n        if playlists['next']:\n            playlists = sp.next(playlists)['playlists']\n        else:\n            playlists = None\n\n    ids = []\n    song_list = []\n    cols = []\n    unique_tracks = list(set(track_art_names))\n    for j, data_tup in enumerate(unique_tracks):\n        try:  # Avoid stoppin\n            track_feats = sp.search(q='artist:' + data_tup[0] + ' track:' + data_tup[1], type='track')\n            track_id = track_feats['tracks']['items'][0]['id']\n            track_pop = sp.track(track_id)['popularity']\n            artist = sp.artist(data_tup[2])\n            features = sp.audio_features(track_id)\n            del features[0]['type']\n        except:  # The track_feats search query returns an empty statement sometimes\n            print(\"err\")\n            continue\n        ids.append(track_id)\n        artist_genre = artist['genres']\n        if not cols:  # First iteration\n            cols = ['Artist Name', 'Track Name', 'Popularity', 'Genres','Playlist']\n            cols.extend(features[0].keys())\n        song_row = [data_tup[0], data_tup[1], track_pop, artist_genre,data_tup[3]]\n        try:  # somehow, some songs have no features\n            song_row.extend(features[0].values())\n        except:\n            continue\n        print(\"Artist = \", data_tup[0], \" Song = \", data_tup[1], \" Id = \", track_id, \" Iter = \", j)\n        song_list.append(song_row)\n\n    return song_list, cols'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.33691Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.337496Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.352907Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.337458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.35174Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The base script - **for scraping data from your library** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"'''import spotipy\nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef main():\n    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>'\n    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR CLIENT SECRET HERE>'\n    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = '<YOUR REDIRECT ID HERE>'\n    SCOPE = \"user-library-read\"\n\n    sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(scope=SCOPE, client_id=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID,\n                                                   client_secret=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET,\n                                                   redirect_uri=SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI))\n    playlists = sp.current_user_playlists()\n    song_list, cols = create_music_dataset(playlists, sp,2)\n    df = pd.DataFrame(song_list, columns=cols)\n    df.to_csv(\"train_music_data.csv\", header=cols)'''","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.35796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.358632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.373783Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.358578Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-22T23:18:00.372673Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ","metadata":{}}]}

In mathematical terms, column vectors $\\vec{A}$ and $\\vec{B}$ are perfectly colinear when there exists an $\\alpha$ and a $\\beta$ such that:\n\n$$\\vec{B} = \\alpha \\vec{A} + \\beta$$\n\nFor example, suppose our dataset contains two columns, \"2015 Price\" and \"2016 Adjusted Price\". The difference between these two columns might be that while the former is in terms of 2015 dollars, the latter is in terms of 2016 dollars (due to inflation). Since inflation is a constant multiple, these two columns would be perfectly colinear!\n\nPerfect colinearity will stop analytically solved ordinary least squares regressors cold, because it creates matrices without unique solutions in the math. In practice, however, perfectly colinear columns are rare. More often we will see partially colinear columns: for example, two different estimates of the odds of players winning in a tennis match. These two columns will probably be close to colinear because we expect bookies to estimate winners' odds very closely to one another.\n\nColinearity is a special case of correlation. Two columns that are highly colinear are also highly correlated, in this specific, line-wise way.\n\nColinearity causes problems with ordinary least squares regression. The reason why is intuitive. OLS is designed around building a line that minimizes the distance from points in n-dimensional space. If two of the dimensions in that space are very near one another, then the algorithm will bias its results towards satisfying these two variables more than satisfying the other variables, because it will get more \"bang\" for its buck.\n\nImportantly, from the perspective of a model fit metric, this is correct. [The usual OLS metrics](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/regression-metrics) are *also* designed around the assumption that your regression isn't overfitting in this way!\n\nWe will need to use a special fit statistic to determine when this is happening. VIF is that statistic.\n\n## Variance Inflation Factor\n\nThe Variance Inflation Factor, of VIF, is a way of estimating the severify of multicolinearity in your model.\n\nSuppose that we have an [ordinary least squares coefficient matrix](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/pumpkin-price-linear-regression), $\\beta$, a matrix of observations $X$ (as would be inputted into `scikit-learn` during training/prediction), a response vector $y$ (as would be inputted into `scikit-learn` during training), and a vector of predictions from our model $\\hat{y}$ (as would be generated by `scikit-learn` during prediction) such that:\n\n$$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k \\beta_k$$\n$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k \\beta_k + \\varepsilon$$\n\n($\\varepsilon$ is the error term)\n\nThen the [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) of an individual coefficient $\\beta_j$ can be estimated by the statistic:\n\n$$\\text{Var}(\\beta_j) \\approx \\frac{\\text{MSE}}{(n-1)\\hat{\\text{Var}}(X_j)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}$$\n\nWhere $R^2_j$ is the $R_2$ of the regression to $X_j$ of the remaining variables in the observation matrix $X$.\n\nThe math for why things work this way is mildly complicated, and out of the scope of this brief tutorial. Basically, this formula tells us that the variance in our estimators (how different we can expect the coefficient to be, given a change or a reshuffling in the data) is related to the mean squared error (a regression fit metric we covered [here](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/regression-metrics)), the number of samples in our dataset, the variance of the cofactor, and this second $R^2$-based term. Put another way, this formula tells us that:\n\n* The most samples in our dataset, the more accurate our model is, on average.\n* The lower the mean squared error, the more accurate our model is, on average.\n* The lower the variance within our variables is, the more accurate our model is, on average.\n* The lower the second term in the equation is, the more accurate our model is, on average.\n\nThis second term is the variance inflation factor! Its position in this formula is why we call it that: because the VIF is proportional to the variance of our $B_j$ estimate, e.g.:\n\n$$\\text{Var}(B_j) \\propto \\text{VIF} = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}$$\n\nAnd VIF is defined mathematically as:\n\n$$\\text{VIF}(\\beta_j) = \\frac{1}{1 - R^2_j}$$\n\nThis is reasonably easy to implement. Sadly, `scikit-learn` doesn't have this built-in (though `statsmodels` does)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7e92d2fc-c45a-42bf-a130-6e223a6f34cb","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"f23b0f4b90d67c545ecd13f6dd56184e0267871c"},"execution_count":null,"source":"from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\ndef variance_inflation_factors(X, clf):\n    vifs = []\n\n    for i in range(X.shape[1]):\n        sub_X = np.delete(X, i, axis=1)\n        sub_y = X[:, i][np.newaxis].T\n        sub_clf = clf.fit(sub_X, sub_y)\n        sub_y_pred = clf.predict(sub_X)\n        \n        sub_r2 = r2_score(sub_y, sub_y_pred)\n        \n        vif = 1 / (1 - sub_r2)\n        vifs.append(vif)\n        \n    return vifs","cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"40db79c1-85dd-4818-8c60-cd4e68e0cac4","_uuid":"ef831ab2d5ef5fe2fcb3452575ec9ecead37d905"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To test out our algorithm (and our understanding of VIF), let's create an artificial dataset of columns generated from the same distribution."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aaa7959f-757f-4d1b-906d-c5e2f92e8ecd","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6e1a332bde03741607bcf842b29bb189658bb2dd"},"execution_count":null,"source":"import numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nclf = LinearRegression()\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\nX = (np.array(sorted(list(range(5))*20)).reshape(20, 5) +\n     np.random.normal(size=100, scale=0.5).reshape(20, 5))\ny = (np.array(sorted(list(range(5))*20)).reshape(20, 5) +\n     np.random.normal(size=100, scale=0.5).reshape(20, 5))","cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7145245a-40b9-4e3b-83a3-95d09650a9a8","_uuid":"bf2af83033bff1019e2f1bfa78622c380b32981e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following `seaborn` plot shows how all five of our input variables in $X$ are very close to linear with one another."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8bc0ebf3-0cc7-436c-9a7b-9813c04ff94f","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"954025405bc86799f400211c6bcf93754d20876f"},"execution_count":null,"source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nsns.pairplot(pd.DataFrame(X))","cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8556d0c3-9684-4411-b95e-bc76505546fa","_uuid":"94e344700dd74f66a47e54675b473a3e774aa5a0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a rule of thumb, a VIF of >10 indicates extreme multicolinearity.

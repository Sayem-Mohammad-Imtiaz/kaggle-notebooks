Conclusion\n\nThe major conclusion is that we could find improvements to optimal guessing using ESG data. The results were most consistent for funds.\n\nFor ETFs or funds+ETFs we there seems to be some overfitting, since the validation error was much larger than the training error. In order to address this would could include me features from the dataset. There is likely some hidden factor that would account for this, see the weaknesses discussed in the beginning. \n\nFor future work I might look into using more features explore how this affects the predicts, and maybe to improve the performance of the ETF case. Trying to outperform a more advanced benchmark than optimal guessing would also be interesting."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Appendix: Data Comparison Between `sustainability_score` and ESG scores\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we perform a regression scatter plot to view the data more completely.

For supervised learning applications, this accepts two arguments: the data X and the labels y (e.g. model.fit(X, y)). For unsupervised learning applications, this accepts only a single argument, the data X (e.g. model.fit(X)).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Available in supervised estimators\n\n**model.predict()** : given a trained model, predict the label of a new set of data. This method accepts one argument, the new data X_new (e.g. model.predict(X_new)), and returns the learned label for each object in the array.\n\n**model.predict_proba()** : For classification problems, some estimators also provide this method, which returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, the label with the highest probability is returned by model.predict().\n**model.score()** : for classification or regression problems, most (all?) estimators implement a score method. Scores are between 0 and 1, with a larger score indicating a better fit.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n#### Available in unsupervised estimators\n\n**model.predict()** : predict labels in clustering algorithms.\n**model.transform()** : given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. This also accepts one argument X_new, and returns the new representation of the data based on the unsupervised model.\n**model.fit_transform()** : some estimators implement this method, which more efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"5\"></a> <br>\n## 5- Training and Testing Data\n\nscikit-learn provides a helpful function for partitioning data, train_test_split, which splits out your data into a training set and a test set.\n\nTraining and test usually is 70% for training and 30% for test\n\n- Training set for fitting the model -> to the numerical features of the customers\n- Test set for evaluation only -> to the \"Yearly_Amount_Spent\" column"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = customers[['Avg_Session_Length', 'Time_on_App','Time_on_Website', 'Length_of_Membership']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = customers['Yearly_Amount_Spent']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=85)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"6\"></a> <br>\n## 6- Training the Model\n\nNow its time to train our model on our training data!\n\n** Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model **"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Create an instance of a LinearRegression() model named lm.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lm = LinearRegression()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"** Train/fit lm on the training data.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lm.fit(X_train,y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#calculating the residuals\nprint('y-intercept             :' , lm.intercept_)\nprint('beta coefficients       :' , lm.coef_)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"7\"></a> <br>\n## 7- Predicting Test Data\nNow that we have fit our model, let's evaluate its performance by predicting off the test values!\n\n** Use lm.predict() to predict off the X_test set of the data.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"predictions = lm.predict( X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"** Create a scatterplot of the real test values versus the predicted values.\nIdeally for each point value and x and y axis should be same**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.scatter(y_test,predictions)\nplt.xlabel('Y Test ')\nplt.ylabel('Y Predicted ')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# here You can check the values Test vrs Prediction\ndft = pd.DataFrame({'Y test': y_test, 'Y Pred':predictions})\ndft.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"8\"></a> <br>\n## 8- Evaluating the Model\n\nLet's evaluate our model performance by calculating the residual sum of squares \n\n- Calculate the  Root Mean Squared Error\n- Mean Abs Error MAE \n- Mean Sqrt Error MSE \n- r2 value "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# calculate these metrics by hand!\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\nprint('Mean Abs Error MAE      :' ,metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test,predictions))\nprint('Mean Sqrt Error MSE     :' ,metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test,predictions))\nprint('Root Mean Sqrt Error RMSE:' ,np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test,predictions)))\nprint('r2 value                :' ,metrics.r2_score(y_test,predictions))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n## 9- Residuals\n\nYou should have gotten a very good model with a good fit.

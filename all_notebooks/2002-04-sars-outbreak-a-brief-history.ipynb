Now in 2020, its relative, the SARS-CoV-2 is giving us a grim reminder of the terrors of living in a pandemic with Covid-19. \n\nMany variables have changed since our last encounter with a coronavirus pandemic, from the contagiousness of the disease to the preparedness of our healthcare system in dealing with this. Nevertheless, it's worth taking a peak at the data and remind ourselves of the lesson that we learned from previous outbreak.

This is the point where the number of new SARS cases are outpaced by the number of recovery (instead of the number of death, fortunately, as our graph show). Nevertheless, this timestamp would serve to indicate that the effort to pushback SARS is finally slowing down the spread of the virus \n\nThere are some other timestamp worth noting from this chart as well:\n- May 16, 2003, the number of recovery outpaces the number of active cases. This could indicate that the tide is turning in the battle against SARS, as there are now more resources available to treat active cases as more people have recovered from the disease. \n- June 16, 2003, the number of active cases drop below the number of total deaths. Not sure if this has any significant meaning, but it should at least that more people are recovering rather than dying.\n- April 10, 2003, the number of recovered patients rocketted from 0 to 1337. Was this spike due to not having numbers reported in earlier dates or was it due to some magical cure (not likely)? \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How was each country affected by SARS?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sars_by_country = sars.groupby(['Country'])['Cases', 'Deaths', 'Recovered'].max().reset_index().sort_values('Cases', ascending=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":" sars_by_country.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we see from here, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and Singapore were most affected by the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, all experienced 200+ cases.

It originated from by far the most famous such scheme, the blue plaque scheme in the United Kingdom (originally London). However, historic markers exist all over the world today. This dataset tabulates many of them. In this notebook we will briefly explore what and where they are, according to the dataset.\n\nHopefully after reading this notebook you will have a decent idea of what this dataset is, and how to progress to doing some more interesting things, like looking at the dataset's NLP content, from there!","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"828a1361455cb42468a9373d1d88bf33d921dfdc","_cell_guid":"642c47f8-3d5d-4765-981c-efdefdcd40fb"},"source":"import pandas as pd\nplaques = pd.read_csv(\"../input/blue-plaques/open-plaques-all-2017-06-19.csv\", index_col=0)\npd.set_option('max_columns', None)\nplaques.head(2)","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9ced73f14c31305d3d9e3da323db6f3b3e4dab4f","_cell_guid":"91f801d1-17b4-4ef7-9453-6753979a8907"},"source":"## Place, time, color, meta","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"f09f6037b6df9ac78803808de80d08cca738a6f0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_cell_guid":"fc8008a7-8777-4362-b875-49aae72132fb"},"source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use(\"fivethirtyeight\")\n\nf, axarr = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 11))\nf.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.75)\nplt.suptitle('Plaque Locations, Times Erected, and Colors', fontsize=18)\n\nplaques.country.value_counts().head(10).plot.bar(ax=axarr[0][0])\naxarr[0][0].set_title(\"Plaques per Country (n=10)\")\n\nplaques.area.value_counts().head(20).plot.bar(ax=axarr[0][1])\naxarr[0][1].set_title(\"Plaques per City (n=20)\")\n\nplaques.erected.value_counts().sort_index().tail(100).plot.line(ax=axarr[1][0])\naxarr[1][0].set_title(\"Plaques erected over Time (t > 1910)\")\n\nplaques.colour.value_counts().head(10).plot.bar(ax=axarr[1][1], color='darkgray')\naxarr[1][1].set_title(\"Plaque colors (n=10)\")","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"00bb99702dc5e92d64469fc9e815c0207f30d765","_cell_guid":"fbf508fd-d040-43d1-a2a5-d69c31dc0787"},"source":"The vast majority of the plaques listed in this dataset are in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Germany. The number of plaques listed for other countries is vanishingly small. This points to signficant localization bias in the way this dataset was generated; while plaques in these three countries are indeed numerous, it is hard to believe that they are so overwhelmingly numerous, while similar countries liek France and Canada have barely any!\n\nWe can see that, furthermore, the data is heavily biased towards individual cities. Berlin leads the pack in terms of the number of plaques in this dataset; in fact almost every plaque in Germany in this dataset is in Berlin! London and Paris follow. Many of the rest of the top cities are either British towns or towns in the United States. Overall, this dataset gives me the impression that it was sampled primarily by combining several other easy-to-access datasets on plaque locations.\n\nI suspect that the datasets for United States, UK, and Berlin plaques are relatively completely, but the data is far more sparse elsewhere. Most of the rest of the data was likely gathered by volunteers.\n\nAlthough blue is the most famous color, a plurality of plaques are actually black. Almost all plaques are either black, blue, or brass, with exceptions being very rare.\n\nPlaque erection has quadrupled since the 1980s, and almost doubled since the year 2000. Clearly plaques are very popular!","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"0bf56ae23c53080acb1842c99508bf511bf2c1bf","_cell_guid":"ad4bfa3f-1a48-45f3-9444-910449dd980e"},"source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use(\"fivethirtyeight\")\n\nf, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))\nplaques['geolocated?'].value_counts(dropna=False).sort_index()[::-1].plot.bar(ax=axarr[0])\naxarr[0].set_title(\"geolocated?\")\n\nplaques['photographed?'].value_counts(dropna=False).sort_index()[::-1].plot.bar(ax=axarr[1])\naxarr[1].set_title(\"photographed?\")\naxarr[1].set_ylim([0, 35000])","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9e187942738a8dc47b494fb5a3312ef39c00ec77","_cell_guid":"74884d09-bb83-468c-9565-2847bc530fe1"},"source":"Metadata about the plaques is present in the vast majority of cases in terms of geolocation, but while a decent chunk of the plauqes are also linked to photographs, not all are.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"94fcca75579aa68250f4fa0d4cb41ea0177c1002","_cell_guid":"9873ee05-a2a0-4528-99de-a7b85937ab4b"},"source":"## Subjects\n\nWho gets historical plauqes?","cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"21725d31d49e9820496a9820c2889e6344724257","_cell_guid":"57cfb395-a906-4785-a3cf-6e6efb6d92eb"},"source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use(\"fivethirtyeight\")\n\nf, axarr = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 11))\nf.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.75)\n# plt.suptitle('Plaque Locations, Times Erected, and Colors', fontsize=18)\n\nplaques.lead_subject_type.value_counts(dropna=False).plot.bar(ax=axarr[0][0])\naxarr[0][0].set_title(\"Subject Kind\")\n\nplaques.number_of_subjects.value_counts(dropna=False).sort_index().plot.bar(ax=axarr[0][1])\naxarr[0][1].set_title(\"# of Subjects\")\n\nplaques.lead_subject_born_in.plot.hist(ax=axarr[1][0], bins=200)\naxarr[1][0].set_title(\"Lead Subject Born In\")\naxarr[1][0].set_xlim([1500, 2020])\n\nplaques.lead_subject_died_in.plot.hist(ax=axarr[1][1], bins=200)\naxarr[1][1].set_title(\"Lead Subject Died In\")\naxarr[1][1].set_xlim([1500, 2020])","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe730f31c63d3c8b7023b0d88f819a8138bc5d51","_cell_guid":"ca6a180b-5c64-47ad-bb96-4ed7fb518892"},"source":"The majority of plaques are actually listed as `nan` in terms of subject kind, but I think we can safely assume that most are men.

Random Undersampling / Oversampling a.k.a \"naive resampling\"\n* Random undersampling: randomly deleting entries in the majority dataset, with replacement.\n* Random oversampling: randomly duplicating entries in the minority dataset, with replacement.\nPros:\nThis is the easiest and fastest way to balance our dataset. \n\nCons:\n* Oversampling our data might cause our model to overfit\n* Undersampling might cause some loss of information to our already small dataset\n\n# 2. Adjusting class weights in our model\nBy adjusting class weights, we are penalizing our model more severely when it wrongly classifies a minority class, and more leniently when it misclassifies a majority class. The minority class will have a larger weight, and vice versa.\n\nThe formula to determine class weights is the following:\n\n> minority class weight = total number of samples in the dataset / (total unique classes * total sample of the minority)\n\nand the majority class weight would be the inverse of that, or 1 - minority class weight. \n\nTo put it concretely, let's say we use a Logistic Regression model using Binary Cross-Entropy for our loss function, given by:\n\n> Loss = −ylog(p) − (1−y)log(1−p)\n \nLet's say we set our class weights for 0 as 1, and 1 as 20, so our loss function becomes:\n\n> Loss = −(1)ylog(p) − (20)(1−y)log(1−p)\n\nPlugging in our p with, say, 0.3 gives us:\n> Loss = 20 log(0.7) = 3.09\n\nWhich is a much bigger penalty compared to when it's only log(0.7). A larger weight results in a larger penalty, which in turn results in a larger coefficient update. In a way, we are incentivizing our model to favor correct predictions for the minority class.  \n\n\n# 3. Changing our evaluation metric\nThis is the simplest way, as well as the easiest method to explain.\n\nAn F-1 Score is a better evaluation metric for our model, since it takes into account Precision and Recall.\n* Precision: out of all that we predict as positive, what proportion do we classify correctly?\n* Recall: out of all the actual positives, what proportion do we classify correctly?\n\nNote that precision and recall is a trade-off. To simplify our thinking process, it's helpful to have a single score as our evaluation metric, that is, the F-1 Score.\n\n![https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-recommendation-systems/9781788993753/assets/dcd94ad1-96f6-4e27-84c9-d6f42e1efee2.png](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-recommendation-systems/9781788993753/assets/dcd94ad1-96f6-4e27-84c9-d6f42e1efee2.png)\n\nThe F-1 score is actually a harmonic mean of both precision and recall.

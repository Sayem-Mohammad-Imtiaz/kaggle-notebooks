Thanks!\n#The Batting Gap\n\n##Top Hitters vs. Everyone\nI am newbie when it goes to data science and machine learning.  So I started to take some classes (the free ones of course).\nI started a class on Udacity that had a final project.  It was to pick a data set and done some data analyst create some visualizations and share it with everyone.  So this workbook is exploring baseball data specifically from 1969-2015 and specifically batting data.\n\nAs the title suggests I am doing my first analysis on batting data and as I started to work on my analysis I noticed some interesting things as it relates to the top hitters and everyone else.\n\nBelow are some finds that I hope you find interesting.

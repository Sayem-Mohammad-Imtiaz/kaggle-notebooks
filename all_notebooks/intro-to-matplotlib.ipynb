Matplotlib\n\n'Matplotlib' is python's core plotting library. If you want to produce graphical summaries of data it is a good place to start, as simple graphs can be created relatively quickly. Matplotlib is also a really useful library to understand basic plotting functionality in general, understanding some matplotlib will really help you out even if you ultimately end up using one of:\n\n* seaborn - makes basic matplotlib plotting look nice, and adds some more advanced plot types, like violin plots, strip plots, kde plots etc. Open-source.\n* bokeh - interactive visualisation for web. Open source.\n* plotnine - a port of R's established ggplot2 library. Open-source.\n\nIn general, when using matplotlib, you go through the following process:\n1. Create a figure with one or more axes, each axis is effectively a blank canvas.\n2. Plot some data onto the axes using one or more graph types.\n3. Decorate and adjust the visual aspects of the plot (e.g. labels, ticks, titles etc.)\n\nThis will become clearer as you learn how to make plots!\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThe cells below show how you can import matplotlib.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-23T07:40:41.262715Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-23T07:40:41.263324Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-23T07:40:41.269518Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-23T07:40:41.263273Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-23T07:40:41.268787Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the import above, you have imported pandas, which should be familiar, as well as matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\nA specific module of matplotlib called pyplot is commonly used for plotting, this allows plots to be made using the same approach that is implemented by MATLAB.

A simple `Figure` contains one `Axes` object, but can contain multiple `Axes` objects. In addition, the `Figure` also contains and manages other objects associated with plot (e.g. titles, legends etc.)\n\n### The `Axes` object\n\nThe `Axes` object is effectively the plot itself and is the main thing you work with when creating a plot. An `Axes` is composed of many objects which can be used to define what is actually represented in the plot. There are a large number of `Axes` methods that allow you to create particular types of plot, like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots and so on. In addition, many of the objects that comprise an `Axes` can be set from the `Axes` object, the axis labels, ticks, ranges and so on.\n\n### Other matplotlib objects\n\nYou might also see references to `Axis` objects which sit inside `Axes` and set graph limits and ticks, `Locator` objects which set tick locations, `Formatter` objects which format labels, as well as the more generic `Artist` object from which all kinds of useful objects like `Line2D`, `Patch` etc. derive. Although you can interact with all these matplotlib objects to tailor an output, most of the time you can do everything you need through the `Axes` object.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

Instead we will create an axis object that we can then manipulate. This will approach ultimately prove *really* useful, particularly when you come to style your plot or make figures with multiple axes.\n\n## Using `plt.subplots()`\n\nIn order to use matplotlib objects effectively for plotting we always start with the same call:\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n```\nThis code creates an instance of a figure (`fig`) with a single axis (`ax`). This is because the default call is effectively:\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 1)\n```\nSetting nrows and ncols to values > 1 creates multiple axes in a grid formation. These axes can be further customised using the [gridspec](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/intermediate/gridspec.html) module, but that is a more advanced undertaking.\n\nOften, the most useful parameter is figsize, which allows you to set the width and height of the figure in inches.\n```python\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (8,8))\n```\nAll of our plots will start with this syntax.\n\n## 3. Bar Charts\n\nHave a look at the basic plot below. It uses the `.barh()` method of `ax` (the `Axes` object we created and called `ax`). This tells matplotlib to create a horizontal bar chart.

I used `Patch` objects for this, Patches have a 'facecolor' and corresponding 'label'. I create a list of the appropriate number of patches, here 2, and pass that list to the 'handles' parameter of the `axes` object's `.legend()` method.

We'll try and do things in stages.\n\n<u>Stage 1</u>\n\nLet's represent the passenger class variable ('pclass') as a pie chart.\n* First, get counts of the 'pclass' column values (Hint: try using `.value_counts()`), store as an object called 'pclass_count'.\n* Now, make a figure and an axis instance, set figsize to (8,8).\n* Call `ax.pie()` and give it the pclass_count object.\n* Label the pie slices using the `labels` parameter by passing the index of  pclass_count.\n\n<u>Stage 2</u>\n\n* Make the wedge labels bigger. First make a dictionary with the key:value pair 'fontsize':12, and pass this to the `textprops` parameter of `ax.pie()`.\n* Improve the look of the pie chart by passing a list of colours to the `colors` parameter of `ax.pie()`, for instance:\n    * `colors = ['r','g','b']` for a really basic red-green-blue\n    * `colors = ['lightseagreen','lightcoral','lightsteelblue']` for some nice named colours.\n    * `colors = ['#a6cee3','#1f78b4','#b2df8a']` which are colourblind safe.\n    * `colors = ['0.2','0.5','0.8']` which are shades of grey.\n* Assign the value %.1f to the parameter `autopct`, this labels the wedges with their percentages to 1 decimal place.\n* Add a title to the axis that reads \"Titanic Passengers by Passenger Class\"\n\n<u>Stage 3</u>\n\n* If you are happy, save the figure and see what it looks like!

Multiple Axes\n\nUsing the `plt.subplots()` method defaults we've been creating figures with a single axis onto which we've been plotting. It is straightforward then to create additional axes within the figure and make multiple plots. The axes will be composed as a grid of `nrows` and `ncols`, and will produce a single figure as normal and an array of axes instances to plot on. As we have done previously, it can be useful to 'unpack' the axes instances. Compare these two snippets of code:\n\n```python\nf, axes = plt.subplots(ncols = 2)\n```\nand\n```python\nf, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols = 2)\n```\nIn the first code snippet, the axes are obtained by specifying `axes[0]` and `axes[1]`, whereas in the second the axes are separately references as `ax1` or `ax2`.\n\nWhen making multiple axes instances, the `sharex` and `sharey` parameter (`False` by default) are useful if you are looking at the same data on a particular axis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# sharey as both axis will be survived proportion.\nf, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(12,6), sharey = True)\n\n# Plot ax1\ntitanic.groupby('embarked')['survived'].mean().plot(kind='bar', ax=ax1)\n# decorate ax1\nax1.set_xticklabels(['Cherbourg','Queenstown','Southampton'], rotation = 0)\nax1.set_xlabel('Port of Embarkation')\nax1.set_ylabel('Proportion of Passengers who Survived')\n\n# Plot ax2\ntitanic.groupby('sex')['survived'].mean().plot(kind='bar', color = ['cadetblue','chocolate'], ax=ax2)\n# decorate ax2\nax2.set_xticklabels(['Female','Male'], rotation = 0)\nax2.set_xlabel('Passenger Sex')\n\n# Add a figure title\nf.suptitle(\"Titanic Survival by Passenger Port of Embarkation and by Sex\");","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-23T07:42:13.457438Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-23T07:42:13.458036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-23T07:42:13.77649Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-23T07:42:13.457994Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-23T07:42:13.775536Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exercise 2\n\nIn this section, we've looked at the plotting functions `.bar()`/`.barh()`, `.pie()`, `.scatter()`, `.boxplot()`, `.hist()` and `.plot()`.

Publications often ask for a minimum of 300 dpi.\n\nMatplotlib can save figure in a range of different filetypes as standard, including:\n* Image (Raster) Formats\n    * .png - 'portable network graphics'\n    * .jpg /.jpeg - 'joint photographic experts group'\n    * .tif /.tiff - 'tagged image file format'\n* Vector Formats\n    * .ps /.eps - Postscript/ Encapsulated Postscript\n    * .pdf - 'portable document format'\n    * .svg - 'scalable vector graphics'\n    \nImage file formats are basically regular grids of cells each with a value representing how that cell should be shaded.

The .pdf is a widely used and highly shareable file format which can be opened by modern web browsers. The postscript formats are primarily used by publishers for printing, you may find that official publications or academic journals request figures as .ps or .eps.

In this vignette you have barely scratched the surface of it's capabilities! Hopefully though you should have a sense of how to make a range of simple visualisations. One of Matplotlib's huge advantages is that you can plot almost anything using it, however sometimes actually achieving this can be tricky. Nonetheless, it is an important library to have at least a passing familiarity as other libraries make use of matplotlib as a backend for specific purposes.\n\nA great example of this is [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), which you may find much more accessible for making data visualisation. In fact, seaborn actually implements a number of interesting and novel plotting methods that aren't directly available through matplotlib. In particular it makes plotting grouped data much easier (see example below).\n\nIf interactive, web-style graphics are more your thing, then [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/) (pronounced as either: bo-kay or bo-kuh) might be worth your time, the simple scatter plot example is reproduced below. Try interacting with the plot.\n\nFinally, if you are an R user who has familiarity using ggplot2, or are otherwise interested in the 'grammar of graphics' (gg) approach, then 'plotnine' may interest you. However, it is not currently part fo the anaconda distribution, so you need to install it (use: 'pip install plotnine' from the command line), unfortunately this can be tricky.

Tech. in Computer Engineering program at [Dr Babasshaeb Ambedkar Technological University Lonere India.](http://dbatu.ac.in) The students learn the basics of Python programming in their Third Semester.\n\nI usually start the lab session of Machine Learning with a programming activity of Exploratory Data Analysis. Hence, this happens to be their first hands-on session for learning Machine Learning. This lab activity is preceded by a few introductory theory sessions on the definition of machine learning, data types from a machine learning point of view, descriptive statistics, and data visualization techniques. Hence I assume the knowledge of these concepts here.\n\n**Dataset** This notebook uses the Titanic Dataset to demonstrate exploratory data analysis with Python. I organizethis notebook in three sections as follows:\n\n1. Dataset initialization\n2.  Querying a Dataset\n3. Dataset Visualization\nThese are the generic steps applicable in any exploratory data analysis activity.\n\n# Dataset initialization:\n\nThe dataset initialization can be divided into two parts. First is importing necessary modules. Here, we import Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn modules.\n\nThe second activity in the data initialization includes loading of the dataset into memory for processing. Here, we are assuming a structured and crossectional dataset. The structured dataset is usually available in CSV (Comma Separated Variables) format. By cross-sectional, I mean data instances are collected over the period of a single duration.\n\n\nPython's Pandas library provides the method *read_csv()* to read a CSV file and to load it as a data frame. The data frame is two-dimensional data structures like the matrix. It can be indexed through non-integer variables also. Further, the data frame method *head()* displays complete information of the first five instances in the dataset which is also referred to as the header\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"y575gcQf2FpK","outputId":"8e03d9ef-d39e-43be-fa34-9eda1e8e16e1","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\n \ndf=pd.read_csv('../input/titanicdataset-traincsv/train.csv')\ndf.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"_BqS_ica9hx2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The next activity is to get the meta-information about the dataset.

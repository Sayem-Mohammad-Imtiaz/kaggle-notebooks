This is to show that the text generator will work just as well by simply changing the text input. The after the Changing Database to Text section, this notebook is the same. Check it out here: https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/pythonicpythonscript4makingmontypythonscripts) \n\nNow we can also generate an unlimited supply of new Seinfeld scripts! This notebook is a compressed version of my text generating AI. Text generator like this one require a lot of computational power so it only became really feasible to do them on Kaggle Kernels when they upgraded to have a GPU and a 6 hour computational limit. Even so, 6 hours is still kind of lean for an LSTM text generator but we can make it work quite well anyways. \n\nThe goal of this notebook is to serve as a introduction to text generation NLPs. These LSTM text generator are actually not that difficult to make. However, most tutorials on the topic are incomplete and/or generate poor results. I'll try to talk about every step of the process thoroughly and clearly. Other than that, this notebook is pretty easy to adapt to any text generation you might want to do. Just pop in any sizeable txt file and the model will learn to make more text in that style. Things like Shakespeare are common and work well for this type of text generation. Make sure that GPU is enabled in settings. Now lets make an AI generate something completely different.\n\n## Imports\nAs always, a block of imports.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ec584a9c8eebbbd2a9403f3d76d67256e4f1715a","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport keras as K\nimport random\nimport sqlite3\n\nfrom keras.layers import Input, Dropout, Dense, concatenate, Embedding\nfrom keras.layers import Flatten, Activation\nfrom keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\n\nfrom keras.preprocessing import sequence\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nfrom keras.layers import LSTM, CuDNNGRU, CuDNNLSTM\nfrom keras.layers import MaxPooling1D\nfrom keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, Callback\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ba7cb1f576a22127ba3f693c034ab0c0cfd8812e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Changing Database into Text\nThe first thing that needs to be done is change the Monty Python database into one nice long string of all the scripts.

Every so many character predictions, the program just changes one of the characters in the pattern to predict on (except the last few, to prevent spelling errors). This causes our model to perceive a slightly different text which causes it to change it's overall predictions slightly too. Without this, even a well trained model might start to repeat itself at some point and get caught in a loop. The loopbreaker can even prevent overfitting or allow under trained models to perform much better. Without a loopbreaker like this, models will need to be trained for many more hours before they can function without looping in on themselves.\n\nChanging this value up and down an interesting way to significantly change the output. Setting it high will have more repeated speech, slightly lower might get many line starting the same then vering off into different directions, really low will get lots of varied text but line structures and format might become unstable.

Text generators like this are pretty good on a line by line basis. Some of the lines seem really plausible as Seinfeld dialogue. Plot and scene structure is off. Different characters show up talking about irrelevant things. In some ways that works comedy. Still, more AI structures are needed to keep track of the plot and such. Anyways, this is the extent of most AI text generation these days without more structured custom code.\n\nFinal thought: Seinfeld is kind of a tough text to generate from. As a general rule, text generators work better the more abstract the language.  Well, not neccarily *better* just that abstract language makes the imperfect text generation less detectable. This is why stuff like Shakespeare and poetry are popular for AI generation (Also why jazz is popular for AI music generators). People have trouble detecting flaws in less everyday language.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"93797c8ca1bf0e897c9c7bf8527e2aab2ed452dd","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"outp = [charindex[x] for x in outp]\noutp = ''.join(outp)\n\nprint(outp)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"db35c3e349e8055f4bc5f6df964bbfc927080cb2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Save Text Output"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e7226b8031c3999c35f17fe26cbf6426970b84e4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"f =  open(\"output_text_sample.txt\",\"w\")\nf.write(outp)\nf.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

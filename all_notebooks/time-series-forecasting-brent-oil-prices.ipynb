It is worth noting that we have uncertainty in the trend, as we do not know  the potential future trend changes, when they will take place and why they will take place (it is virtually impossible). We therefore can do the best we can in the present time - assume the future price of the oil will see similar trend changes as it's history. \n\nThus, we are going to try and slice the time data as much as we can to where it is evident that more of a trend is occuring - as we can see from the above plot, lets decide to forecast the trend occuring after the year 2004.\n\nThe Prohpet forecast model will detect the changes in the trend, and an uncertainty level is set into this by default (80%) - this increases the forecast uncertainty and gives a \"window\" for change in future trends.

We can draw the following conclusions:\n\n* The model correctly predicted (the turqoise line) that the price will increase from the date our original data ends (2019-09-30)\n* However, the prediction did not detect the suddon decrease the actual price data experienced (orange line). Possible reasons are that the model did not develope sufficiently after the drastic trend decrease we identified between 2014 - 2016. Moreover, our forecasting 365 day forecast period may be rolled forward too much i.e. the prediction model is not sensitive enough to the data to predict short term fluctuations"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

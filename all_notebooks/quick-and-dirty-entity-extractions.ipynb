This task could be step one of many towards the development of an automated scientific discovery tool. Society can thank us later. \n\nBut where do we begin? Well, a part of the solution has to deal with [knowledge extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_extraction). In order to create a conversational engine that understands scientific papers, we'll first need to develop an entity recognition module, and this, lucky for us, is the topic of our notebook! \n\n\"What's an entity?\" you ask? Excellent question. Take a look at the following sentence:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"eaf6ec29040862106ea42ad59e0ffd61bbfd6a5a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Dr. Abraham is the primary author of this paper, and a physician in the specialty of internal medicine."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a244b432b4d1fa6aba94fe1b1d580d7c8f65b5d6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, it should be relatively straighforward for an English-speaking human to pick out the important concepts in this sentence:\n\n> **[Dr. Abraham]** is the **[primary author]** of this **[paper]**, and a **[physician]** in the **[specialty]** of **[internal medicine]**."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1d35311478ba8c958158b4258d478b349bd448c4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These words and/or phrases are categorized as \"entities\" because they represent salient ideas, nouns, and noun phrases in the real world.

The good doctor is a real person and an instance of the \"physician\" class, and is therefore considered \"named\". Examples of named entities include \"Google\", \"Neil DeGrasse Tyson\", and \"Tokyo\", while regular, garden-variety entities can include the list just mentioned, as well as things like \"dog\", \"newspaper\", \"task\", etc.\n\nLet's see if we can get a computer to run this kind of analysis to pull important concepts from sentences.

Indeed, blindly pulling all entities from a text source is in fact simple, but it's sadly not all that useful. In order to justify this exercise, we'd need to develop an entity extraction approach that is restricted to, or is cognizant of, some particular domain, for example, neuroscience, psychology, computer science, economics, etc. This paradoxical complexity makes it nontrivial to create a generic, but useful, entity recognizer. Hence the lack of support in most open-source libraries that deal with natural language processing. \n\nTo largely simplify our task then, we must generate a set of entities from a scientific paper, that is <strong><em>larger</em></strong> than a simple list of named entities, but <strong><em>smaller</em></strong> than the giant list of all entities, restricted to the domain of a particular paper in question. \n\nYikes. Are you sweating a little? Because I am. \n\nInstead of reaching for some Ibuprofen and deep learning pills, let's make a prototype using a little ingenuity, simple open-source code, and a lot of heuristics. Hopefully, through this process, we'll also learn a bit about the text processing pipeline that brings understanding natural language into the realm of the possible.

We're dropping any numeric entities for now because they are harder to deal with and don't really represent new concepts. You'll notice (if you look closely enough), that we are also ignoring any hyphenated entities. In spaCy's tokenizer, it is possible to prevent hyphenated words form being split apart, but we'll reserve this, along with other types of advanced fine-tuning or low-level editing to if and when we move beyond the prototype phase. \n\nSo far, in the past few steps, we've deal with one-word entities. However, it's also entirely permissible for combinations of two or more words to represent a single concept. This means that in order for our prototype to successfully capture the most relevant concepts, we'll need to pull n-length phrases from our academic abstracts in addition to single word entities.

The <strong>noun phrase</strong> or <strong>chunk</strong> is an abstraction which consists of two or more words, and is the by-product of dependency parsing, POS tagging, and tokenization. spaCy's POS tagger is essentially a statistical model which learns to predict the tag (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for a given word using examples of tagged-sentences. \n\nThis supervised machine learning approach relies on tokens generated from splitting text into somewhat atomic units using a rule-based tokenizer (although there are some interesting [unsupervised models](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) out there as well). Dependency parsing then uncovers relationships between these tagged tokens, allowing us to finally extract noun chunks or phrases of relevance. \n\nThe full pipeline goes something like this: \n\n<strong>raw text</strong> &rarr; <strong>tokenization &rarr; </strong> <strong>POS tagging</strong> &rarr; <strong>dependency parsing</strong> &rarr; <strong>noun chunk extraction</strong>\n\nTheoretically, one could swap out noun chunk extraction for named entity recognition, but that's the part of the pipeline we are attempting to modify for our own purposes, because we want n-length entities.

In addition to this granular processing, we'll also want to remove words that are frequent in the English language, as a heuristic to naturally drop stop words and uncover the domain of each academic source. \n\nWhy is this?\n\nWell, in NLP, as in search engine optimization (SEO), the most common words in a given corpus are known as [stop words](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/dropping-common-terms-stop-words-1.html). These unfortunate candidates are hunted down with extreme prejudice and removed from the population to improve search results, enhance semantic analysis, and in our case, help restrict the domain. This is because removing stop words automatically limits the vocabulary of a corpus to the words that are less frequent and therefore, more likely to exist in that abstract than anywhere else. \n\nYou can, of course, argue that the most common words in a scientific paper might in fact be the most important concepts, but stop words are usually overwhelmingingly overrepresented in any corpus. This intuition however, is exactly why we aren't going to simply take the most common words in one specific abstract and remove them. Instead, we'll be targetting the most frequent words based on a large, general domain sample of the English language. \n\nThe \"freq_words.csv\" file you might have noticed earlier in our data environment, is actually a list generated from a corpus with 10 billion words gathered by the good people at [Word Frequencey Data](https://www.wordfrequency.info/).\n\nLet's take a look at the list and then remove these words from our set of entities.

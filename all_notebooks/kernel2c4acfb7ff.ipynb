After crossing various levels, there are gates placed which are usually there to show users ads or it is a paywall to purchase the app this acts as an income for the mobile puzzle game.\n\nProblem: We now consider a challenge of placing gates. Initially the control group has a gate placed on level 30, but what if we place the gate at level 40. There are chances the user might be interested to play more i.e. retention might increase for each player and increasing the traffic for the mobile game but to be confident enough we should back up our conversion rates with valid explaination or statistical analysis. To check whether placing gate is leading to more retention we perform A/B testing.\n\nThe unit of diversion is a user id through which the user(experimental units) are randomly split into two different groups i.e. Control and Experiment. \nEvaluation metric or response variable chosen here is the retention of a player.This metric is used to measure the impact of your change. Retention is basically people coming back to your product to use it gain.\n\nOur interest lies in comparing means of both the control and experimental group \n\nWe first start with EDA of the dataset to get a picture of what kind of data is and what it holds.\n\n\nGenerate Hypothesis: \nNull Hypothesis: It states there is no difference between the control and experiment group. \n                 The conversions rates are same in both the groups.\n                 There is no statistical significanct result.\n\nAlternate Hypothesis: There is difference between the control and experiment group.\n                      Convsersion rates are different in both groups\n                      It gives Statistical Significant result\n\n\nRejecting the Null Hypothesis\nDetermine their is a difference between the treatment and control\nStatistically signicant result\n\n\nPower analysis and Significance level: Once after deciding the metrics and the hypothesis, we should check whether do we have enough data to run our A/B testing. When calculating sample size these errors should be avoided:\n<li>To avoid type I errors, you specify a significance level when calculating the sample size.\n<li>To avoid type II errors, you set the power at 0.8 or 0.9 if possible when calculating your sample size, making sure that the sample size is large enough.\n\nFor this problem, We choose a confidence Interval i.e. 95% that gives us the value of alpha=0.05 and beta .\nSignificance Level of the test(Alpha) =0.05\nPower level of the test( 1 - Beta) = \n\nA test having a smaller significance level and high power is desirable.\n\nThe goal of power analysis is to estimate sample size using the values of alpha and beta.\n\nConclusion : If the p value is smaller than the alpha(0.05) . Then we can reject the null hypothesis.\n\nHave a look on my article for more better understanding.\nhttps://medium.com/@anjalitiwari02199/a-b-testing-a-python-approach-part-1-75fdb904f271\nhttps://medium.com/@anjalitiwari02199/a-b-testing-a-python-approach-part-2-9958ed870a6f\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing Libraries needed for this project\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport math as mt\nfrom __future__ import division\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the dataset\ncookie_cats = pd.read_csv(\"C:/Users/VArun/Downloads/cookie_cats.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><b>Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis<b>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Checking what kind of data is stored\ncookie_cats[0:10]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"The dataset contains 5 variables.

The Data Science of Shoelaces\n\nNike has hired you as a data science consultant to help them save money on shoe materials. Your first assignment is to review a model one of their employees built to predict how many shoelaces they'll need each month. The features going into the machine learning model include:\n- The current month (January, February, etc)\n- Advertising expenditures in the previous month\n- Various macroeconomic features (like the unemployment rate) as of the beginning of the current month\n- The amount of leather they ended up using in the current month\n\nThe results show the model is almost perfectly accurate if you include the feature about how much leather they used. But it is only moderately accurate if you leave that feature out. You realize this is because the amount of leather they use is a perfect indicator of how many shoes they produce, which in turn tells you how many shoelaces they need.\n\nDo you think the _leather used_ feature constitutes a source of data leakage? If your answer is \"it depends,\" what does it depend on?\n\nAfter you have thought about your answer, check it against the solution below."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_1.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

Getting Rich With Cryptocurrencies?\n\nYou saved Nike so much money that they gave you a bonus. Congratulations.\n\nYour friend, who is also a data scientist, says he has built a model that will let you turn your bonus into millions of dollars. Specifically, his model predicts the price of a new cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin, but a newer one) one day ahead of the moment of prediction. His plan is to purchase the cryptocurrency whenever the model says the price of the currency (in dollars) is about to go up.\n\nThe most important features in his model are:\n- Current price of the currency\n- Amount of the currency sold in the last 24 hours\n- Change in the currency price in the last 24 hours\n- Change in the currency price in the last 1 hour\n- Number of new tweets in the last 24 hours that mention the currency\n\nThe value of the cryptocurrency in dollars has fluctuated up and down by over \\$100 in the last year, and yet his model's average error is less than \\$1. He says this is proof his model is accurate, and you should invest with him, buying the currency whenever the model says it is about to go up.\n\nIs he right?

But how can you best incorporate the surgeon information into the model?\n\nYou have a clever idea. \n1. Take all surgeries by each surgeon and calculate the infection rate among those surgeons.\n2.

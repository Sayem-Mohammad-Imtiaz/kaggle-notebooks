Using latitude and longidute, it can be determined that this source is located in Minneapolis, MN. Due to the high proportion of office, residential, storage, and parking data from this location, it likely corresponds to Downtown Minneapolis Minnesota United States.\n- Most common energystarscore is 1.0.\n- Mostly recorded in Offices. Also a few data points in lodging/residential, warehouse/storage, parking and healthcare space usages.\n- All buildings with reported energystarscore also have reported eui (energy usage intensity). This is important to note because in the metadata dataframe as a whole both of these fields are very sparsely populated.\n\n\n### What is it?\n**Using the 1 – 100 ENERGY STAR score, you can understand how your building’s energy consumption measures up against similar buildings nationwide. The ENERGY STAR score allows everyone to quickly understand how a building is performing.**\n\nBased on general building information including size, location, number of occupants, etc., this score’s algorithm estimates hypothetical energy usage for best performance, worst performance, and every level in between. It then compares the actual energy data reported to these estimates to determine where the building ranks relative to other buildings across the country with the same primary use. In this way, ENERGY STAR scores are based on national survey data originating from the  Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS).\n\nThis rating system is used by the EPA to determine energy efficiency in buildings nationwide (USA). This system is also used in Canada.\n\nThe following property types are eligble for receiving a 1 - 100 ENERGY STAR score in the US:\n- Bank branch\n- Barracks\n- Courthouse\n- Data or Distribution center\n- Hospital\n- Hotel\n- K-12 school, Residence hall, or Dormitory\n- Multifamily housing\n- Non-refrigerated or refrigerated warehouse\n- Office (including Financial and Medical offices)\n- Retail store, supermarket/grocery store, or wholesale club/supercenter\n- Senior care community\n- Wastewater treatment plant\n- Worship facility\n\n\n**Interpreting the Score:** 50 represents median energy performance, while 75 or above means your building is a top energy performer.\n\n*Learn more* [here](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/energy-star)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"energystarscore = meta[meta['energystarscore'].notna()]\nprint(energystarscore.shape)\nenergystarscore.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"energystarscore['energystarscore'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(energystarscore['energystarscore']=='-').sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"energystarscore['energystarscore'] = energystarscore['energystarscore'].replace('-', np.nan).astype('float64')\nenergystarscore['energystarscore'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"starscore = energystarscore[energystarscore['energystarscore'].notna()]\nprint(starscore.shape)\nstarscore.head(54)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(starscore['energystarscore']).plot.bar(figsize=(15,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(starscore['primaryspaceusage']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploring leed_level\n### In this dataset...\n- There are 136 unique locations that reported an energystarscore out of the total 1636 rows.\n- The leed_level is measured in categories, ranging from certified to platinum.

Once these minimmum requirements are met, you are free to go for any credit you want within your chosen rating system. Credits are how you earn points toward your LEED cerification. The following are the different rating systems:\n- LEED for Building Design and Construction\n- LEED for Interior Design and Construction\n- LEED for Building Operations and Maintenance\n- LEED for Neighborhood Development\n\n\nThe LEED rating system has seven areas of concentration: Sustainable Sites, Water Efficiency, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, Indoor Environmental Quality, Innovation in Design Process, and Regional Priority. Projects obtain credits in these areas to achieve certification. In totality there is a maximum of 110 available points to be achieved across all four categories. The point distributions offered across these categories is as follows:\n- Sustainable Sites: 26 Available Points\n- Water Efficiency: 10 Available Points\n- Energy and Atmosphere: 35 Available Points\n- Materials and Resources: 14 Available Points\n- Indoor Environmental Quality: 15 Available Points\n- Innovation in Design Process: 6 Available Points\n- Regional Priority: 4 Available Points\n\n\nProjects pursuing LEED certification earn points for various green building strategies across several categories. Based on the number of points achieved through credit completion, a project earns one of four LEED rating levels: \n1. Certified (40-49 points earned)\n2. Silver (50-59 points earned)\n3. Gold (60-79 points earned)\n4. Platinum (80+ points earned)\n\n*Learn more* [here](https://www.usgbc.org/)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"leed_level = meta[meta['leed_level'].notna()]\nprint(leed_level.shape)\nleed_level.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"leed_level['leed_level'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(leed_level['leed_level']=='None').sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"leed_level['leed_level'] = leed_level['leed_level'].replace('None', np.nan)\nleed_level['leed_level'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"leed = leed_level[leed_level['leed_level'].notna()]\nprint(leed.shape)\nleed.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(leed['leed_level'], normalize=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(leed['leed_level']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(leed['primaryspaceusage']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploring ratings\n\n## In this dataset\n\n* There are 184 locations that reported values for the ratings column\n* Each of these locations are in the UK or Ireland\n* There are 9 unique values in the ratings column (A-G, C1 and D1)\n* The wolf site recorded the C1 and D1 values most likely because the wolf site is the Univ.

Both BER and EPC measure and rate energy performance in a similar enough way to compare the two. However, they have slightly different formats. EPC uses a scale of A-G with A being the most energy efficient and G being the least. BER uses a scale that goes A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, E1, E2, F, G. These ratings are considered comarable because they use such a similar scale and criteria to measure energy efficiency.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings = meta[meta['rating'].notna()]\nprint(ratings.shape)\nratings.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings['rating'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings[ratings.rating == 'C1']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings[ratings.rating == 'D1']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings['rating'] = ratings['rating'].replace('C1', 'C')\nratings['rating'] = ratings['rating'].replace('D1', 'D')\nratings['rating'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(ratings['rating']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(ratings['site_id']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.value_counts(ratings['primaryspaceusage']).plot.bar(figsize=(10,5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

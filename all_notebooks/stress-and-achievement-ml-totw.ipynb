{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Task: Can you predict stress levels or personal achievements with ML?\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to use machine learning to rank important features for determining a person's daily stress and achievements. The notebook begins with descriptions of each feature, followed by a plot of the distributions of each feature. Next, the notebook shows feature weights using permeation importance. The final section of the notebook uses the model to predict a person's level of stress and achievement based on a user's input (one will need to fork the notebook to enter their own info).\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n* Yvon Dalat https://www.kaggle.com/ydalat for both the dataset and the task.

Typically I look for (based on experience and not a firm formula) a weight of .2 or higher for a given feature.\n\nIt is worth noting that a high feature importance does not mean a linear relationship. For example if high achievers were primarily made up of two groups of people, one who rarely ate vegetables and slept 8 or more hours a day, and another group who ate tons of vegetables and slept fewer than eight hours a day. In this example both sleep and vegetable eating would have a strong impact on the model, but would have a mediocre correlation.

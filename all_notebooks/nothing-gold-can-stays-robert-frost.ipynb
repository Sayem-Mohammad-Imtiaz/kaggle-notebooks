His work was initially published in England before it was published in the United States. Known for his realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech, Frost frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early 20th century, using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.\"\n\n\"Frost was honored frequently during his lifetime and is the only poet to receive four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. He became one of America's rare \"public literary figures, almost an artistic institution.\" He was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 for his poetic works. On July 22, 1961, Frost was named poet laureate of Vermont.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ2HE-uDLvOoiRdNw810jMvODPrc24976bALg&usqp=CAU)slideshare.net","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/robert-frost-collection/robert_frost_collection.csv\", low_memory=False)\nprint(df.shape)\ndf.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'gold',\n                                     'color': 'purple'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T23:33:34.216691Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T23:33:34.217065Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T23:33:34.250336Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T23:33:34.217033Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T23:33:34.249286Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:52:52.899918Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:52:52.90029Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:52:52.909806Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:52:52.900257Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:52:52.908636Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.redd.it/m721qo3ywsk31.jpg)reddit.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features with missing values\ncategorical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>0 and df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint(categorical_nan)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:58:05.929564Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:58:05.930022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:58:05.938796Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:58:05.929972Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:58:05.937669Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# replacing missing values in categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_nan:\n    df[feature] = df[feature].fillna('None')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:58:23.798339Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:58:23.798973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:58:23.805714Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:58:23.798928Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:58:23.804938Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df[categorical_nan].isna().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:58:38.587517Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:58:38.588046Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:58:38.597565Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:58:38.588013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:58:38.596607Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Handle numerical features with nan value\nnumerical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>1 and df[feature].dtypes!='O']\nnumerical_nan","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:59:09.87699Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:59:09.877512Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:59:09.886344Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:59:09.877471Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:59:09.885464Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df[numerical_nan].isna().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-25T21:59:34.640914Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-25T21:59:34.641267Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-25T21:59:34.652003Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-25T21:59:34.641237Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-25T21:59:34.650978Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Replacing the numerical Missing Values\n\nfor feature in numerical_nan:\n    ##

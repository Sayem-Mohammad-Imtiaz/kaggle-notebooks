The death penalty is an extremely complex topic and much deeper analyis could be conducted. The normalizing data that I used was simply easily accessible census data. More targeted normalization with appropriate historial data for each year could be very helpful. Also, as noted above, some of the analysis concerning the death penatly and race could benefit from the use of a crime dataset that aligned with the feature values in this dataset.\n\nThere are a few additional areas that I can immediately think of for further exploration that I would be intersted in exploring at a later date.\n\n1) Does the sex of the victim appear to correlate to to application of the death penalty? What about race?\n\n2) What methods of the death penalty are most commonly used.

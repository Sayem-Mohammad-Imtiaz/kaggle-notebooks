(skip if you do SEO)\n\n1. **You typically search alone:** Whether on your phone or laptop,  you are mostly by yourself. This means two things. \n    - Alone means only for you: If two or more people were to decide on a movie to watch, or a restaurant to go to, they would have to find an option that caters for most people, something like the average. You end up compromising a little. Not with search, you say exactly what you want.\n    - Alone means private: If a group of friends are talking about something new to you, you might be embarassed to ask what that thing is. Not with Google, you simply search for \"who is X?\" or \"what is Y?\". No embarrasment. Sometimes you might be concerned about something, maybe a medical or psychological condition you might be having. Before alarming your loved ones, you safely go and ask The Google. \n2. **Search is active:** Compared to most other media, search is one of the few that only happen when you make a request. Listening to the radio, for example, you get messages that you didn't ask for during a show that you asked for.\n3. **Perfect timing:** Because search is an active task, it happens at the perfect moment. Because you search when you are interested, ready, and receptive.  \n4. **Expression of interest (not a selection from options):** When you go to a restaurant and are given a menu, you have to choose an option. There might not be exactly what you are craving at that moment, or what your body needs. Again, you will have to compromise a little and order something quite close. With search you say exactly what you want, no matter how ridiculously detailed that thing is that you are searching for. \n\nSo, on search we express our exact desires, actively, in private, honestly, and when we are most receptive. So, I think it's important to know what content people are given at those moments.\n\n\n### Approach\n\nWe will connect to Google's custom search engine API: This is mainly used to create a search engine on your website, and allows you to customize it. We will use it to get results for research purposes:\n1. [Create a custom search engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/).  At first you might be asked to enter a site to search. Enter any domain, then go to the control panel and remove it. Make sure you enable \"Search the entire web\" and image search. You will also need to get your search engine ID, which you can find on the control panel page.  \n2. [Enable the custom search API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/customsearch.googleapis.com). You wil need to create a project for this first.\n3. [create credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/customsearch.googleapis.com/credentials) for this project so you can get your key.\n4. [enable billing for your project](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects) If you want to run more than 100 queries per day. The first 100 queries are free, then for each 1,000 queries you pay $5.\n\nOnce this is set up (once you have your custom search engine ID, and your key), we will be ready to construct our queries and get the data. \n\nWe will be using the `serp_goog` function from the [advertools](https://github.com/eliasdabbas/advertools) package. To install it:  \n`pip install advertools`\n\nStart first be defining two variable as we will be using them in every request.

For example you operate in two English-speaking countries, Canada and Australia.  \nAs with the last example, you simply need to pass a list of countries as you did with the keywords, and all combinations will be requested and handled: \n\n`yoga_mats = adv.serp_goog(q=['manduka yoga mats', 'thick yoga mats', 'cheap yoga mats'],   cx=cx, key=key,   gl=['ca', 'au'])`\n                           \nThis will create 3 (keywords) x 2 (countries) = 6 (requests, and 60 rows therefore)\n\nKeyword | Country\n--------|----------\nmanduka yoga mats| Canada \nthick yoga mats| Canada \ncheap yoga mats| Canada\nmanduka yoga mats| Australia\nthick yoga mats| Australia\ncheap yoga mats| Australia\n\nAgain, this is done with one request, and the resulting DataFrames get merged into one. \nThe same applies to any of the parameters of the function.

But sometimes you want to go futher than the first page, to explore futher. The `start` parameter determines which position to start the results from. So if you specfiy `start=7` for example, you will get the ten results starting from position seven.  \nYou can further restrict the number of results you get with the `num` parameters. This determines the number of results to return, and can only be between one and ten, inclusive.  \nBecause we can specify multiples parameters, we can use a simple trick of passing multiple `start` numbers.\n\n`basketball = adv.serp_goog(q=\"basketball\", cx=cx, key=key, start=[1, 11, 21]`  \nThis means simply to make three requests, starting at position 1, 11, and 21.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6042a5f8bad3c80eeb080b3189e0d0b6135fe289","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# basketball = adv.serp_goog(q=\"basketball\", cx=cx, key=key, start=[1, 11, 21])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"404b8265a1bb7a58c88085c06df06c737453a95a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"basketball = pd.read_csv('../input/basketball.csv', parse_dates=['queryTime'])\nprint('Rows, columns:', basketball.shape)\nprint('\\nRanks:', basketball['rank'].values, '\\n')\nbasketball.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e06478be527a2faa0ed8cc33f33502ff362645db"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Date Restriction\n\nYou can make a request while restricting the date of the content you are asking for, to be within the last X days, weeks, months, or years.  \nThis is done through the `dateRstrict` parameter. It takes the following possible values: d, w, m, y, and possibly you can add an integer to specify how many days or months you want to restrict your query. \n- `d`: results from the last day.\n- `d5`: results from the last five days.\n- `w` or `w5` for example.\n- `m`, `m3`, `y`, `y6` etc.\n\nLet's see for example how results differ if we search for \"Donald Trump\" with different dates:\n\n`trump =  adv.serp_goog(q='donald trump', cx=cx, key=key, dateRestrict=['d1', 'd30','m6'])`  \n\nAs you can guess, this will make three requests one asking for data from one day ago, from 30 days ago, and finally six months.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# trump = adv.serp_goog(q='donald trump', cx=cx, key=key, dateRestrict=['d1', 'd30','m6'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"512b3c6b8adcc7beb5a45b8735e11d151e06b5d9","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trump = pd.read_csv('../input/trump.csv', parse_dates=['queryTime'])\ntrump.groupby(['dateRestrict']).head()[['rank','dateRestrict','title', 'snippet', 'displayLink', 'queryTime']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fb23108593f615b0fd19c35f2267c085735796bb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Naturally, some sites like Wikipedia or Twitter would show the same URL, but the news ones show a different story based on the date option that we specified.

This can be done by the `siteSearch` and `siteSearchFilter` parameters. For example: \n\n`adv.serp_goog(q='iphone', cx=cx, key=key, siteSearch='www.apple.com', siteSearchFilter=['e', 'i'])`\n              \nAs you can guess this will make two requests for the keyword 'iphone', one including `i` only www.apple.com and the other excluding `e` apple.com and searching the whole web. \n\n\nThis was a quick overview of how you can get SERP data easily, on a large scale, and consistently.  \nThis can be used for exploration and ongoing work.\n- **Exploration:** at the beginning of a project where you still don't know about the main players, how diverse the landscape is, competition etc. You would typically make a few queries, analyze some data and decide on what to focus on. \n- **Ongoing:** once you have a good idea, then you would probably want to run the same queries once a month, to keep track of how things are progressing, how positions are changing, and whether other players are making changes in their strategies. \n\nHappy to get any [feedback, bugs](https://github.com/eliasdabbas/advertools), or [suggestions](https://twitter.com/eliasdabbas).\n","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

The two-pronged plan, which aligns with federal and state plans, focuses on scaling up specific COVID-19 related interventions, mainly by reinforcing healthcare services, while maintaining critical programmes and activities within the 2020 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP).\n\nSomalia has so far recorded five cases and has instituted measures to contain the possible spread of COVID19 including closing schools, banning large gatherings and suspending international and domestic passenger flights. Preventing deaths and debilitating illness are the prime concerns, humanitarian partners are also concerned about the possible impact of the virus on the livelihoods of vulnerable populations in Somalia including internally displaced people, food insecure communities, and people living in locust infested or floodprone areas. The reliance on remittance by relatives in the diaspora is also likely to diminish as bread winners outside the country see their economic opportunities reduced.\n\nGiven the current global context of the outbreak, including the exponential reporting of confirmed cases, the risk of COVID-19 spreading remains high because of crowded living conditions in urban centres and poor hygiene practices.\n\nAccording to WHO, countries in fragile, conflict and vulnerable settings like Somalia are especially at risk for wide-spread community transmission should an imported case go undetected among the general population.\n\n`Somalia’s capacities to prevent, detect and respond to any global health security threat scored 6 out of 100` as measured by the Health Emergency Preparedness Index in 2016.https://www.africanews.com/2020/04/04/coronavirus-somalia-somalia-humanitarian-bulletin/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://scontent.fsdu5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/97610244_1729044917252606_5697977058261467136_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=6e5ad9&_nc_oc=AQl_YZch2q0ZsBFGVxFl1xtDTz2jCeEsWk_6BLSh3RWXYDpuMpBVGbTNyg1HYDPDqtGZ5Jsu0drHrmQZLg5BTtA7&_nc_ht=scontent.fsdu5-1.fna&oh=47514cd8ffa1d53a4286e4d3f886a99d&oe=5F230DE8)\nhttps://pt-br.facebook.com/pg/iomsomalia/posts/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/SO/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf1 = pd.read_table(\"/kaggle/input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/SO/Somalia-en-result-119-original.txt\",header=None)\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#OCHA AND COVID-19 \n\nThe coronavirus now has a foothold in 216 countries, areas or territories.

I wanted to check two basic questions : \n\n* ** Does the number of versions a kernel has any impact on popularity?** \n* **Does the number of days a kernel is worked on has any impact on popularity?**\n\nPopularity in this dataset can refer to Votes, Forks, Views, Comments etc. I basically saw some users running their kernels multiple times,  so I wanted to know if that has any impact.  Also some kernels in this dataset has been worked over multiple days while other kernels has 2-3 versions at max. However, after extracting the info from the version histories I also checked how the number of kernels ran varies by year and month. (For this I only used the last time the kernel was ran instead of all the other versions, assuming that was the published finalized kernel). \n\nTl, dr answer is neither number of versions of a kernel nor number of days a kernel has been worked on show high positive or negative correlation with Votes, Views, Forks, Comments etc, but since this is a dataset of top kernels, the minimum number of upvotes for a kernel in this dataset is 33(!) and on average the kernels here has 98 upvotes, which is way more than regular 3-4 upvote kernels, if we had checked correlation in the population of all kernels we'd likely get different results.

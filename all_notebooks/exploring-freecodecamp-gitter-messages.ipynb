In other words, it was removed from the list of things that users were directed to immediately after they signed up. This reduced a _lot_ of traffic (probably mostly from low-volume posters). If I have the time, I would love to see what the impact of that change was in the type of messages (and level of noise) created in the chat. I suspect me-too type posts went down quite a bit, and that that effect would be measurable with a bit of NLP work.\n\nHere's another way of representing the same information.

I haven't even taken a look at by far the most interesting feature of all: its textual NLP content. This dataset is a record of millions of messages from novice computer science learners and learning community members; what can you discover about the language they use, and/or about freeCodeCamp itself, by examing the text content of their speech? The possibilities are major!\n\nHopefully you enjoyed this simple EDA!"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

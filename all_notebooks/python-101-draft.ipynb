Python Basics\n### 2.1 Data Types\n\nBefore we can learn about how to write and execute Python code, it is important that we first learn about some of the most common data types that we will be working with.\n\nPython comes with the following built int data types:\n\n![](https://i2.wp.com/ivyproschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/blog-1.png?resize=972%2C450)\n\n1. Numerical Data Types:\n    * Integers (int): Positive or negative whole numbers e.g. 5\n    * Floats (float): Any real number with a decimal place e.g. 5.7\n\n\n2. Booleans:\n    * Booleans (bool) are built in True or False values. Take note that booleans are denoted with a capital 'T' and 'F'\n\n\n3. Sequence Types:<br>\n    * Sequence data types are an ordered collection of similar of different data types and the two most common types are\n        * Strings (str): A collection of one or more chracters in single or double quotes. e.g.'a', 'abc'\n        * Lists (list): A list is a collection of one or more data items which need not be of the same type, encapsulated in square brackets e.g. ['a', 1]\n\n\n4. Dictionaries:\n    * Dictionaries (dict) are an unordered collection of data that always come in a key: value pair enclosed in curly brackets. e.g. {'Fruit':'Apple'}\n\n\nOne easy way to identify the data type of an item is to use the in-built `type()` function.    \n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(type(5))\nprint(type(5.7))\nprint(type(True))\nprint(type('abc'))\nprint(type(['a', 1]))\nprint(type({'Fruit':'Apple'}))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Trivia #1: Without using the `type()` function, identify the data types of the following items.\n1.

In Python, variables are **mutable**, meaning that they can be changed after you have created them.\n\n\nVariables cannot be reserved words (eg. \"sum\", \"print\", \"type\") and cannot contain any spaces between characters."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"a = 5\nb = 3.5\n\nprint(type(a))\nprint(type(b))\n\nc = a + b\n\nprint(c)\n\nc = 500\n\nprint(c)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 2.2.2 Operators\n\n1.

Logical/Comparison Operators\n\n| Operator     | Description                            |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| ``a == b``   | ``a`` equal to ``b``                   |\n| ``a != b``   | ``a`` not equal to ``b``               |\n| ``a < b``    | ``a`` less than ``b``                  |\n| ``a > b``    | ``a`` greater than ``b``               |\n| ``a <= b``   | ``a`` less than or equal to ``b``      |\n| ``a >= b``   | ``a`` greater than or equal to``b``    |\n\nNote that in python, `=` is used as an assignment operator whereas ``==`` is used to check for equality and the two cannot be used interchangeably.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Indexing\nWe've learnt previously that strings and lists are an ordered collection of data types. This means that we can access each individual list/string element by using square brackets and the corresponding index numbers of the element. \n\nNote that Python uses _**zero-based**_ indexing so the first element in a list always has index 0. Alternatively, we can also access elements from the end of the list using negative numbers startin from -1.\n\n![](https://www.alphacodingskills.com/python/img/python-string.png)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']\n\nprint('The planet closest to the sun is',planets[0])\nprint(planets[-4],'and',planets[-3], 'are also known as Gas Giants')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"a = 'Papaya'\nprint(a[0])\nprint(a[-1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 2.2.4.

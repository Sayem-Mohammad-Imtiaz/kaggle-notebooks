The series comprises the period of approximately 10 years (1998 to 2017).\n\n### Column\n\n- year: the year when the Forest Fires happen\n- state: Brazilian State\n- month: the month when the Forest Fires happen\n- number: Number of Forest Fires reported\n- date: Date when Forest Fires where reported\n\n## Limitation\n\nAfter went through the data set, I suspect that there are outliers on the data. This indicated by how high the number of reported forest fire is several months and states. However, we do not know how sever is 1 forest fire reported. It maybe represent some area or some duration, but who knows?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preview and Data Cleaning\n\nWe will first look at our data, try to understand the structure of the data and the basic statistic.

This information should be a lead for us to take action to investigate deeper on what is the trigger of the forest fire.

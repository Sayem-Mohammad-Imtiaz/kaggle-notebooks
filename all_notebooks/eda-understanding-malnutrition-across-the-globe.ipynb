This includes:\n* Undernutrition caused by wasting, stunting and underweight\n* Inadequate vitamins and minerals \n* Overweight and obesity\n\nAn estimate of 1.9 billion adults were overweight or obese, while approximately 462 millions of them were underweight. WHO also estimated that 45% death among children were caused by undernutrition. This mostly happen in low and middle-income countries. Shockingly, the amount of obesity and overweight issues were on the rise in these same counties. In this exploratory data analysis, we will dive deeper into the topic and identify key issues that lead to the prevalance of malnutrition across the world.

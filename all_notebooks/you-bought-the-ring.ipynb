However, I cannot overlook the expensive talents of Jon Lester, John Lackey, Ben Zobrist, Dexter Fowler and Aroldis Chapman.\n\nI've been saying this non-stop since October 2016:\n*The Chicago Cubs purchased their 2016 World Series Ring.*\n\nBut does this hold up? Does how much a team spend on talent increase the odds of winning? Do the big-market teams really have an edge in this game? **We'll use the data to see the league payroll ranking of each World Series winner in the respective year.**\n\nOriginally, I wanted to use all WS and payroll data since the Modern Era, however, we only have salaries from 1985 onward."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f5bc938d-c309-2b74-8fa9-ebce7efbee82"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsalary = pd.read_csv(\"../input/salary.csv\")\nteams = pd.read_csv(\"../input/team.csv\")\n\ngroupedSalary = salary[salary['year'] >= 1985]['salary'].groupby([salary['year'], salary['team_id']]).sum()\nwsWinners = teams[(teams['year'] >= 1985) & (teams['ws_win'] == 'Y')][['year', 'team_id', 'name']]\n\nfor index, row in wsWinners.iterrows():\n    yearlySalaries = groupedSalary[row['year']]\n    wsWinners.set_value(index, 'payroll', yearlySalaries[row['team_id']])\n    wsWinners.set_value(index, 'payroll_rank', yearlySalaries.rank(ascending=False)[row['team_id']])\n    \nwsWinners[['year', 'name', 'payroll', 'payroll_rank']]"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19873039-57da-a0c8-5b49-01dc29a00d5c"},"outputs":[],"source":"winData = wsWinners['payroll_rank'].value_counts().reset_index()\nwinData.columns = ['payroll_rank', 'win_count']\n\nplt.bar(winData['payroll_rank'], winData['win_count'], color = 'red')\nplt.axis([0, 25, 0, 5])\nplt.ylabel('World Series Wins')\nplt.xlabel('Payroll Rank')\nplt.title('World Series Wins by Payroll')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"029a58b3-ea11-4e8d-6f4e-e193729d45f0"},"source":"**Takeaways**\n\n 1.

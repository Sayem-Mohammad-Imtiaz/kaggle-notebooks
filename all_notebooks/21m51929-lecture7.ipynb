I chose this column because it will give a clear picture of which countries are promoting vaccination at the highest pace.\n\nFor the color bar, I chose viridis instead of rainbow. The reason is that viridis consists of colors in the same color system, hence we can judge the values simply base on the color depth.\n\nThe results of the analysis are as shown. Observing the recent dates, we found that China, the US, India, and Brazil have the most fastest vaccination speed. (brightest color) The number of daily vaccine injections in these countries can exceed millions, but when the upper limit of the range was set at about millions, the numbers in the other countries were compared and stayed in a deep color. Therefore, I set the upper limit to 800k in order to show the differences between countries in an understandable way.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Mission2: Hourly animation of global earthquake locations ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Code and result:**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv(\"../input/earthquakedata20100112/query.csv\")\ndf.index=pd.to_datetime(df['time'])\ndf['time']=df.index.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00')\ndf=df.sort_index()\nfig2=px.scatter_geo(df,lat='latitude',lon='longitude',color='mag',animation_frame='time',color_continuous_scale='rainbow',range_color=(1.0,9.0))\nfig2.update_layout(title_text=\"Earthquake happened on 12nd January 2010\",title_x=0.5)\nfig2.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T11:25:07.282298Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T11:25:07.282898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T11:25:07.475777Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T11:25:07.282846Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T11:25:07.474574Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Description**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The analysis was conducted on January 12, 2010, the day when Haiti earthquake occurred.

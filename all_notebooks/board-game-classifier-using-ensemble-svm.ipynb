In this dataset we have been provided with three files. Our major concern is with the board game review file, which contains user comments and ratings for a game. Our goal is, given the board game review, we have to predict what rating out of 10 it will have.\n\nFor multi-class text classification Naive Bayes theorem has proved to be the best algorithm out there, but a lesser known fact is that a machine learning model is only as good as the data it has been trained on.\n\nWe are dealing with a massive dataset with a file size of more than 1GB. Alot of preprocessing and cleaning of data will be required before we can feed the model the data for it to train on. Since this is a textual dataset, we will be making use of regexp and many other libraries throughout this project to keep our focus on the actual problem, of building a good machine learning model.\n\nDisclaimer: This notebook is not created on jupyter, but on Google Colab, since i kept running into memory issues in pd.read_csv, even with reading the inputs in chunks.

Empty Strings can also be counted under missing values and be removed,by making them NaN and dropna().\n\n5. Applying lowercase to all text ensures that, words like 'the' and 'The' arent identified separately.\n \n6.

The sheer volume of Data set, was a major hurdle. Reading the dataset on my personal computer wasnt even possible. I had to use google colab to complete all of this work. Even then i had to sample the data, instead of using the whole data as the time it would take to proces the data was insanely long\n2.   Preprocessing the data was also cumbersome, since this was a text classification problem, it was critical the data was as clean as possible. With the help of regex and python's apply function, the data was cleaned, but tasks such as lemmatizing and stemming were too tedious to perform\n3.   The imbalanced dataset was a problem on its own, and training pretrained classifiers on it dropped accuracies to single digits. I was able to undersample a dataset of relatively large size and use ensemble method to get a ensemble classifier which performed perfectly\n4.   The low accuracy score of the coveted Naive Bayes algorithm was a shock, which opened my eyes to the fact that data can make or break an algorithm, and SVM performed better than our Naive Bayes\n5.   Deploying the model on live website was a challenge on its own. 1GB dataset was way beyond the limitations of free hosting websites.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"Pnb9aCmxmCmd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##Conclusion:\n\nEnsemble SVM, which contained had Linear SVMs from both balanced and imbalanced dataset, had the highest accuracy in our study.

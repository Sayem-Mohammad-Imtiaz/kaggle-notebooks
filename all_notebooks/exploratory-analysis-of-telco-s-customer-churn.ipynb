Also, I would really appreciate recommendations or feedback of Kaggle's users that would help improve my python skills.\n\n#### Context\n\nExploratory analysis of Telco's customer database, with information about the attributes of its customers, services hired, monthly and total charges among others.\n\n#### Aim of the Analysis\n\nThe aim of this analysis is to explore the data set and try to find out if there is a strong relation (correlation) between the different customer attributes and the target variable, \"Churn\".\n\n#### Customer Churn\n\nOK, we are going to analyze Telco's Customer Churn, but *What is Customer Churn???* *Customer Churn* is the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame. It is possible to calculate churn rate by dividing the number of lost customers during that time period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that time period. Obviously, companies should aim for a churn rate that is as close to 0% as possible.\n\nFor example, if you start your quarter with 400 customers and end with 380, your churn rate is 5% because you lost 5% of your customers.\n\n### Step 1 - Import libraries\n\nFirst of all, we have to import the different libraries (with all their functions) that we are going to use in this analysis:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n```\n\n- **pandas:** help us to organize data and manipulate the data by putting it in a tabular form.\n- **numpy:** is mainly used for working with arrays.\n- **math:** give us the possibility of calculate advanced mathematical operations.\n- **matplotlib.pyplot:** is a plotting library used for 2D graphics in python programming language.\n- **seaborn:** is a data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. \n- **LabelEncoder:** help us to encode target labels with value between 0 and n_classes-1, in others words will convert categorical fields into numerical.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 2 - Read document\n\nOnce we have imported the libraries, we are going to use the *read_csv* function of pandas to read the [Telco's Customer Churn data](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) and create our Panda's DataFrame.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv\")\n```\n\nThis will help us to transform the csv data to a 2-D labeled data structure with columns of potentially different type.

Actually, this is happening to me right know! \n\nExpert's recommendation is to always keep in mind the aim of the analysis as a whole. Every step should be oriented to answer or explain the problem raised.\n\nOK! I get it ...

Also, as we have verified before, there is a negative correlation between with the people that have Partner (-0.15), those that have a partner are more likley to stay on the company.

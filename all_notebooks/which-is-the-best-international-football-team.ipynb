Let's also note the impressive series of Spain, France and Brazil, at a time when each of this teams dominated the worldwide football. At a local level, Padania (North of Italy) also had a very long streak from 2008 to 2014.\n\nHowever, this table doesn't seem to show which were the best teams, having local teams (Padania, Guyana) and teams winning a lot of game at a regional scale (Mauritius, Australia, ...).

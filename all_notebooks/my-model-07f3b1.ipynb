You will need to translate the concepts to work with the data in this notebook, the Iowa data.\n\nCome to the [Learn Discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-forum) forum for any questions or comments. \n\n# Write Your Code Below\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"86b26423-563a-4fa1-a595-89e25ff93089","_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"1c728098629e1301643443b1341556a15c089b2b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom learntools.core import *\n\n\n\n# Path of the file to read.

It's also a well known fact that all millenials live in their parents basements. Clearly, they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! But.. if a millenial could find a city where the avocados are cheap, they could live out the millenial American Dream.\n\n### Data\nThe table reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados.\n\n**Some relevant columns in the dataset:**\n* `Date` - The date of the observation\n* `AveragePrice` - the average price of a single avocado\n* `type` - conventional or organic\n* `year` - the year\n* `Region` - the city or region of the observation\n* `Total Volume` - Total number of avocados sold\n* `4046` - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold\n* `4225` - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold\n* `4770` - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold\n\n### Objective\nIn this notebook, we will try to understand and answer the following questions:\n* In which cities can millenials have their avocado toast and buy a home?\n* Was the Avocadopocalypse of 2017 real?\n\n## Importing the libraries and retrieving the data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\navocado = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/avocado-prices/avocado.csv\", index_col=0)\n\n# sorting data frame by Date\navocado.sort_values(\"Date\", axis=0, ascending=True, inplace=True, na_position='last')\navocado.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**We need to check the file for missing data**  \nWe don't see any indication for the use of a special mark for missing data.

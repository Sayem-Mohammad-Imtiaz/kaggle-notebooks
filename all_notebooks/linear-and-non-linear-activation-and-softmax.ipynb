The inputs given to the node by the input tensors must be reshaped so that may be shipped off to the output tensor. The reshaping operation that does this is known as the **activation function**.\n\nThe simplest activation function is `linear`. A linear activation is simply a linear transform on the data. The input signals from the tensors that sink into the node are simply added up, and the result of that addition is packaged and sent downstream through the output tensor. A linear activator allows a node to learn linear relationships within the data. However, linear relationships are limited in power, as they can only learn on linear transformations of the dataset. A neural network consisting of linear layers is comparable to a simple linear regression model in power, as it can only discover and interpret signals in the data which are linearly shaped.  But, they are brutally simple, and trivially easy to train, as their derivative when performing backpropagation is a constant value of 1. In other words:\n\n$$f(x) = x \\implies f'(x) = 1$$\n\nTechnically speaking, there *is* one other activation function that is even simpler than linear activation: **binary activation**. We saw this kind of activation function in \"[Implementing a perceptron](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/implementing-a-perceptron/)\". Binary activation is so simple, however, that it isn't useful for anything except for trivial examples, and Keras doesn't even implement it.\n\nIn this notebook I'm going to look at an example application of both linear activation and a non-linear competitor: softmax activation. The example will be based on an artificial dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"acaf422dc804987457a6ea415e9a2d620bb79a8b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Single-class model\n\nWe'll start with a demonstration of basic `keras` in action.

The denominator in the expression is the sum across every value passed to a node in the layer. In other words, the softmax function is dependent not just on the contribution of the current value, but on that of every other value passed to this layer in the network. This is nice because it normalizes the values. The values outputted by nodes in a softmax layer will always sum to 1. When we are performing classification, these values are directly interpretable as probabilities!\n\nThe `exp` terms ($e$ to an exponent) give the resulting values an exponential character. This formula has a few interesting characteristics. Maximum values and values very near maximum are distorted to be even larger after the transformation, at the cost of smaller values, which are made even smaller.\n\nThis effect is further enhanced if you start with large values, which will increase the skew even further. In other words, unlike the linear function the softmax function is *not* scale-invariant. It can help (a lot) to normalize the values in the dataset prior to training.\n\nLet's train a neural network which differs from the previous neural network solely in its use of the softmax function for the output layer."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"64cd02b7de4dd053df06b0b5b7298bb76096a246","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = Sequential()\nclf.add(Dense(3, activation='linear', input_shape=(1,), name='hidden'))\nclf.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax', name='out'))\nclf.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=SGD(), metrics=['accuracy'])\n\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=128)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"171acf1da4983ca0b5a4d3234fde4dfd114a12c1","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_test_pred = clf.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fd75608048bc6b96183882ec2c7bde3f54b22ffa","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_test_pred[:5]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"41b1e979df115c53f9290fa172e7a30a4eecdeea"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, the values we get now are very easily interpretable. We can see in the second case for example that the network is highly confident that the given value is a class 0 observation. In the first case it is less confident that that the second.\n\nNote that the output of a softmax layer will always sum to 1, and can thus be *interpreted* as a probability. However, doing so is highly suspect when the loss metric we are using doesn't use these probabilities. For example, loss metric I used for this example, cross-entropy, only cares about getting things right or wrong, and not the probabilities assigned to those values by the model. Thus the model has no incentive to gauge realistic probabilities; it only needs to get close enough approximations to pick a winner. We can reliably order these values: e.g. look at `[0.29880288, 0.41953945, 0.2816577 ]` and say \"Class 2 is more likely than Class 1, which is more likely than Class 3\". But we would get into hot water if we tried to say \"Class 2 and Class 3 are almost equally likely\".\n\nThe Naive Bayes algorithm is a non-neural machine learning technique has a similar asterisk in this regard.

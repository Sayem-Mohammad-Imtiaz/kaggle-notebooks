Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.

For example: classifying the gender as male or female, predicting the result as win or loss, etc.</li>\n    <li><b>Multiclass Classification</b> : Here we have to classify the data into three or more classes.

We must take steps to remove outliers from our data sets.\n\nDue to these outliers bulk of the data in the loan amount is at the left and the right tail is longer. This is called right skewness. One way to remove the skewness is by doing the log transformation. As we take the log transformation, it does not affect the smaller values much, but reduces the larger values.

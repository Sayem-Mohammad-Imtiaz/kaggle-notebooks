It also includes vehicle to vehicle fatal     accidents, however these incidents are fewer in number when compared to the overall data set. Note: There is no neighbourhood information.\n        - Vehicle Collision or Pedestrian Struck (with Injury): Includes all categories of vehicle involved accidents with injuries. This includes pedestrian and cyclist involved incidents with injuries. Note: There is no neighbourhood information\n        - Homicide: A person, directly or indirectly, by any means, causes the death of another person.\n        - Mischief: A person commits mischief that willfully causes malicious destruction, damage, or defacement of property. This also includes any public mischief towards another person.\n        - Offence Against a Person: An attack on a person causing harm that may include usage of a weapon.\n        - Other Theft: Theft of property that includes personal items (purse, wallet, cellphone, laptop, etc.), bicycle, etc.\n        - Theft from Vehicle: Theft of property from a vehicle\n        - Theft of Vehicle: Theft of a vehicle, motorcycle, or any motor vehicle\n        - Theft of Bicycle: Theft of a bicycle\n- YEAR: A four-digit field that indicates the year when the reported crime activity occurred\n- MONTH: A numeric field that indicates the month when the reported crime activity occurred\n- DAY: A two-digit field that indicates the day of the month when the reported crime activity occurred\n- HOUR: A two-digit field that indicates the hour time (in 24 hours format) when the reported crime activity occurred. Note: This information is based on the findings of the police investigation. No time information will be provided for Offences Against a Person crime type\n- MINUTE: A two-digit field that indicates the minute when the reported crime activity occurred. Note: This information is based on the findings of the police investigation. No time information will be provided for Offences Against a Person crime type.\n- HUNDRED_BLOCK: Generalized location of the report crime activity. Note: Locations for reported incidents involving Offences Against a Person have been deliberately randomized to several blocks and offset to an intersection. No time or street location name will be provided for these offences. For property related offences, the VPD has provided the location to the hundred block of these incidents within the general area of the block. All data must be considered offset and users should not interpret any locations as related to a specific person or specific property. Coordinates data for records with “Offset to Protect Privacy” was not disclosed to provide privacy protection. X NK_LOC ST is default location value used for incidents with unknown location and is geolocated to 312 Main Street\n- NEIGHBOURHOOD: The Vancouver Police Department uses the Statistics Canada definition of neighbourhoods within municipalities. Neighbourhoods within the City of Vancouver are based on the census tract (CT) concept within census metropolitanarea (CMA). The Musqueam Indian Band is located in the southwest corner of the City of Vancouver. There is a service agreement between Musqueam and the City of Vancouver, where the City provides municipal services such as policing. As a result, Musqueam crime data is included with the VPD Open Data.\n- X: Coordinate values are projected in UTM Zone 10. All data must be considered offset and users should not interpret any locations as related to a specific person or specific property.\n- Y: Coordinate values are projected in UTM Zone 10.

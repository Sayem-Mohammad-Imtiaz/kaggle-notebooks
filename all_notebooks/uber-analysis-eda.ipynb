If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

City:**\nAs per the analysis, the morning time slot is most problematic where the requests are being cancelled. Most probably the requests are being cancelled by the drivers due to the morning rush as it being the office hours and seeing the destination as airport which would be too far, the driver would think to earn more for the shorter trips within the city.\n\n**Pickup Point - Airport:**\nUpon analysis, the evening time slot seems to be most problematic for pickup points as airport where the requests being No Cars Available. The reason seems to be that not enough cars are available to service the requests as cars might not be available at the airport due to the cars serving inside the city.\n\n**Conclusions:**\nBased on the data analysis performed, following recommendation can be used by Uber to bridge the gap between supply and demand: -\n\nFor bridging the demand supply gap from airport to city, making a permanent stand in the airport itself where the cabs will be available at all times and the incomplete requests can come down significantly.\nUber can provide some incentives to the driver who complete the trip from city to airport in the morning part. This might result the driver to not cancel the request from city to airport trips.\nLast but sure solution to bring down the gap is to increase the numbers of cab in its fleet."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

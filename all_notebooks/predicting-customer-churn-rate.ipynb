Introduction:**\n\n\nChurn is defined as movement of customer from one company to another. \nThe reasons can for exa[](http://)mple be: \n• Availability of latest technology \n• Customer-friendly bank staff \n• Low interest rates • Location \n• Services offered \n\n\nIt is very important for a bank to predict the churn rat eof customers which will further help them in deciding the marketing strategies.\nThe cost of attracting new customers can be five to six times more than holding on to an existing customers.\nLong term customers become less costly to serve, they generate higher profits, and they may also provide new referrals, on the other hand,Losing a customer usually leads to loss in profit for the bank.\n\n\nSo with this dataset we can analyse the features responsible for customer churn, which will help the bank in determining its future plans and strategies and help the bank predict whether the customer will churn or not.

So the bank needs\n   to review the decisions and implement more strategies and programs in order to target the older customers may be by including some schemes\n   such as better investment plans, tax-free bonds etc.There are also exceptions that ther are many older people which even tend to stick with\n   their banks as can be seen from the Extreme/Values or outliers in the people whi have not churned.\n3. From the boxplot of tenure it can be seen that majority of the people have been in the bank for around 5 years.

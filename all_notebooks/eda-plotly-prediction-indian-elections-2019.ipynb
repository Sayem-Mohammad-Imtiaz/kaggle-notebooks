Let us look at them in the below points:\n\n1. In 2019, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed the most number of seats all over India- dominating clearly over all the national and the satte specific parties. The outreach created by them has really made them claim their position in the Lok Sabha.\n2. Gerneally, education is regarded as a significant factor while voting. Arounf 72%+ of the winners are having a gradutae + degree. This is a significant factor for a developing nation like India- where we need educated politicians to lead the nation.\n3. The general paticipation of Female politicians is much less than the male politicians. A balanced gander ratio would be good enough- as people from all sectors would be able to contribute to the progress of the society.\n4. The average age of polticians is high. It might be an advantage if younger politicians contest and are able to lead the nation. Altough is is never a parameter to think that the older politicians wouldn't be able to perform their tasks well- but it comes with the risk of health and age related issues.\n5. Criminal activities is a serious concern- as the people who are elected by us- indirectly are the face of the nation. They should be more of a role model-rather than someone who is not respected.\n6. As our prediction suggestes, we have reached an accuracy of 96.2% in estimating the winning participants using Random classifier model. I shall work upon to improve this model further in the future updates\n\n# About the data\n\n1. The data is very good- cleaned and well presented. Need to just have some further checks upon the validity. I have found some discrepancies in the data which I will be sharing.\n2. Some data types and columns needed basic cleaning which we have done as seen above.\n3. Overall it gives us a good sense about Indian poltical scenerio and what factors should we consider while we choose our representative. Its our reponsibility to choose the right candidates, such that they can make the difference!\n\n# Please upvote if you liked the Analysis!!!","metadata":{}}]}

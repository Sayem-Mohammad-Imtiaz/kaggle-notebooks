Some plots are very helpful in visualizing outliers, such as **box plots** and **scatter plots**. However, it is sometimes tricky to decide whether or not to remove the outliers. We should remove outliers when we are certain that these outliers were results of some errors.\n\n#### Box plot\n----\n\nBox plots, by definition, plot outliers as points and group the rest of the observations.

Random Forest Classifier \n\nThe Random Forest method, first introduced by Breiman in 2001 can be grouped under the category of ensemble models. Why ensemble? The building block of a Random Forest is the ubiquitous Decision Tree. The decision tree as a standalone model is often considered a \"weak learner\" as its predictive performance is relatively poor. However a Random Forest gathers a group (or ensemble) of decision trees and uses their combined predictive capabilities to obtain relatively strong predictive performance - \"strong learner\". \n\nThis principle of using a collection of \"weak learners\" to come together to create a \"strong learner\" underpins the basis of ensemble methods which one regularly comes across in Machine learning.

Gradient Boosted Classifier\n\nGradient Boosting is also an ensemble technique much like the Random Forest where a combination of weak Tree learners are brought together to form a relatively stronger learner. The technique involves defining some sort of function (loss function) that you want minimised and an method/algorithm to minimise this. Therefore as the name suggests, the algorithm used to minimise the loss function is that of a gradient descent method which adds decision trees which \"point\" in the direction that reduces our loss function (downward gradient).\n\nTo set up a Gradient Boosting classifier is easy enough in Sklearn and it involves only a handful of lines of code. Again we first set up our classifier's parameters\n\n**Initialising Gradient Boosting Parameters** \n\nIn general there are a handful of key parameter when setting up tree-based or gradient boosted models.

In the last exercise you used bag of words vectors as the model input. We can, of course, improve on bag of words which is typically considered a baseline encoding.\n\nWord embeddings (also called word vectors) are vector encodings for words that are learned by considering the context in which the words appear. Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors. For example, vectors for \"leopard\", \"lion\", and \"tiger\" will be close together, while they'll be far away from \"galaxy\", \"oolong\", or \"castle\".\n\nWhat's even cooler is that relations between words are often maintained. Subtracting the vectors for \"man\" and \"woman\" will return another vector. If you add that to the vector for \"king\" you'll end up at the vector for \"queen\" (or at least close by).\n\n![Word vector examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/linear-relationships.png)\n\nThese vectors can be used as features for machine learning models. Word vectors will typically improve the performance of your models above bag of words encoding. SpaCy uses embeddings learned from the Word2Vec model. To access them, you need to load one of the large language models, like `en_core_web_lg`. Then they will be available on tokens from the `.vector` attribute."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport spacy\n\n# Need to load the large model to get the vectors\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# Disabling other pipes because we don't need them and it'll speed up this part a bit\ntext = \"These vectors can be used as features for machine learning models.\"\nwith nlp.disable_pipes():\n    vectors = np.array([token.vector for token in  nlp(text)])"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"vectors.shape"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The embeddings from SpaCy are 300 dimension vectors.

Instead, you need a vector representation for the entire document. A document vector is calculated by averaging the word vectors for each token in the document. Then, these document vectors are used to train the model. \n\nSpaCy calculates the average document vector which you can get with `doc.vector`.

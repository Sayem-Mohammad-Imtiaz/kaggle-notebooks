I always keep exploring how to make my visualizations more interesting and informative. One of the jobs of a data scientist is to tell a story with the data at their disposal, and you really want to make the data jump out at the reader, to make your visualizations as understandable as possible. \n\nAnother one of our main tasks is data manipulation. Today the main tool I use for that is Pandas (Python). What if I tell you that you can build some beautiful and interactive charts for the web right from your Pandas dataframes? Well, you can! We can use Plotly for that. Fortunately, this is a great time for Python plotting, and after exploring the options, a clear winnerâ€Šâ€”â€Šin terms of ease-of-use, documentation, and functionalityâ€Šâ€”â€Šis the [plotly Python library](https://plot.ly/python/). In this article, weâ€™ll dive right into plotly, learning how to make better plots in less timeâ€Šâ€”â€Šoften with one line of code.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with plotly itself, I drew up a brief beginner's guide a while back, available [here](https://kyso.io/KyleOS/plotly-intro). Some of the plots I generated in that post are re-created here - so it'll be interesting for you to see how cufflinks simplifies plotly's (already surprisingly simple)syntax when working with pandas."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plotly - Brief Overview"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plotly python package is an open-source library built on plotly.js which in turn is built on d3.js.

I hear negative stories about 'suicide rates' is not going down in Japan. I remember growing up there, there were so many rules I had to follow,,, like you can't dye your hair, you can't have your opinions unless your senior allows you to talk, etc. \n\n### I remember being an unique individual wasn't friendly as much as here in the United States. There is a saying 'a nail sticks out gets hammered down'- if you are different, you won't be accepted. I always had my opinions, and I remember it was not easy for me to growing up there. People thought I was different since I talked too much. lol.\nAs a girl and being young, it was not okay for me to say my opinions unless it was my turn to talk. Well, enough talk for me about my cultural experience there. It is time for coding! \n\n### By the way, I love being in Japan. This is NOT for negative idea toward Japanese society or anything, but just wanted to see an idea of how Japanese people rated for this outcome. As much as I miss going back to Japan, I wanted to see how the hapiness grade is doing compared to other countries.

Being an unique in Japan is still a challenge for the country. \n- *Gaenerosity* - I was a little shocked to see the result. Japanese people are pretty generous, they are very kind and group oriented. But compared to european countries, maybe they are not still catching up.\n- *Perceptions of Corruption* - I haven't heard that much goverment corruption issues, but something like retired public servants take up lucrative private sector roles in retirement, is known as corruption in Japan. Some embezzlement between politicans and other big well known corporations, etc, are the main issues. \n\n### Japan and Worst Countries\n- *Social Support* - Japan is a peaceful and well-organized country. Japanese government has a good health care system, public transportations, and education systems, that would give people in Japan comfortable. \n- *Perceptions of Corruptions* - It is still a decent country compared to the worst countries. \n\n## Japan is a very beautiful, clean, and organized country that almost everyone wants to visit, but it is not the perfect for people who wants to live in an unique society. It is a very strict and deciplined society. If you go to school or work there, you would know! If you don't want to follow the country's idea, maybe it might be hard for the person to live there for a long time. This project taught me great points of Japanese view of living there.

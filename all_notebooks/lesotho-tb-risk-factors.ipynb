Its population of approximately 2 million inhabits mostly rural areas – some living near treacherous roads that are sometimes obliterated by floods or blanketed by heavy snows. Others live far from roads, tucked into the folds of mountains that can be a day’s ride by horse to the nearest town. Cell phones do not work there; foot messengers bring news.\n\nWhen it came to mounting a national response to multidrug-resistant TB, or MDR-TB, Lesotho faced other obstacles. It had no laboratory capacity to process sputum samples for TB diagnosis; it shipped all samples to South Africa. It had no pharmaceutical system through which to order the proper drugs for patients. It had almost no doctors or nurses trained in treating MDR-TB. It had no hospital with the proper infection control measures to protect health-care workers. And most frighteningly, its TB epidemic was being fuelled by the explosive number of HIV and AIDS cases: an estimated 23% of adults aged 15 to 49 years were infected with HIV, the third highest rate in the world, unknown thousands of whom were coinfected with TB.\n\nBut the country did respond, acting almost immediately in 2006 when, in the words of Health and Social Welfare Minister Dr Mphu K. Ramatlapeng, “we had the scare from South Africa”.\n\nThe scare was an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) in Tegula Ferry, a town in South Africa’s KwaZulu Natal province, just beyond Lesotho’s eastern border. Of the first 53 patients, 52 had died. From that moment, Lesotho treated drug-resistant TB as an emergency. It created a national plan of action, and from the start sought outside experts.https://www.who.int/tb/publications/2009/airborne/lesotho/lesotho_patient/en/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsburdencsv/burden.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'burden.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"World Health Organization (WHO) led to an application to the Green Light Committee, a WHO initiative that oversees distribution of quality assured drugs used to treat MDR-TB; the committee approved, with money from UNITAID, the release of drugs for up to 400 MDR-TB patients.\n\nTwo knowledgeable outside groups: Partners In Health, which has experience in treating drug-resistant TB in the developing world, and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) helped with the experience in setting up laboratory systems for a range of diseases, including for TB diagnosis.\n\nIn April 2007, FIND renovated the country’s main laboratory in two months, reconfiguring the facility from six to four rooms, installing a negative air system with air locks on rooms to protect workers from infection, and introducing a MGIT machine that could complete a number of tests to determine the drug-resistance patterns of TB cases.

It began renting several one or two-room homes for TB patients who lived far from Maseru but would need to live there during their treatment in case of emergency. And on the outskirts of Maseru, the Government identified an underused health centre for leprosy patients and turned it into a 20-bed TB hospital that also had a negative air pressure system to lessen the risk to health workers. The renovations, and other work on the MDR-TB project, were paid for with a US$ 3 million grant from the Open Society Institute. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare also made available its in-house air service – the Lesotho Flying Doctor Service – which picked up TB patients at three remote locations and flew them to Maseru for treatment.\n\nManaging and treating MDR-TB (multidrug resistant TB) are never simple, not even in the most advanced medical settings, and the programme has wrestled with several complications. In Health Lesotho’s MDR-TB programme, it appears that patients there have experienced more serious side effects from anti-TB drugs than in other countries, likely related to HIV-TB coinfection and severe malnutrition. That has complicated efforts to return patients to their communities as quickly as possible; one side effect, renal or kidney failure, “could create an emergency situation that has to be managed in a few hours or the patient could die. https://www.who.int/tb/publications/2009/airborne/lesotho/lesotho_patient/en","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.catplot(x=\"measure\", kind=\"count\",hue = 'risk_factor',palette='viridis',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#TB Risk Factors: alcohol, diabetes, HIV, smoking, under-five years (old)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_dist_col(column):\n    pos__df = df[df['best'] ==1]\n    neg__df = df[df['best'] ==0]\n\n    '''plot dist curves for train and test weather data for the given column name'''\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n    sns.distplot(pos__df[column].dropna(), color='green', ax=ax).set_title(column, fontsize=16)\n    sns.distplot(neg__df[column].dropna(), color='purple', ax=ax).set_title(column, fontsize=16)\n    plt.xlabel(column, fontsize=15)\n    plt.legend(['best', 'iso_numeric'])\n    plt.show()\nplot_dist_col('iso_numeric')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Patients must adhere to treatment\n\nA key strategy towards that end was training hundreds of community health workers in the basics of TB control, including making sure patients adhered to their treatment. “It was a long effort,” “Sometimes  they didn’t want to take the drugs – they make patients feel confused and angry.

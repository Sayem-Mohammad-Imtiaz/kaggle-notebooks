This would ensure most bookings to not being cancelled. They could also apply no-refund policies or make the refund policies rather strict so the customers choose not to cancel.\n* It is quite clear most customers travel in pairs and bringing children or babies along are very rare so the hotels could advertise in ways that attract couples more and also business travellers.\n* Most guests do not return but as these customers have already visited once, advertisements should be targeted in such ways so they are bound to return the next time they visit. The customers could also be offered special benefits if they do return to stay."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

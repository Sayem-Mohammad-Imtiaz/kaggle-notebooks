It was developped with the aim to analyse BigData efficiently. Following is about  datatable package.(**Taken from datatable github page**)\n\nThe set of features that we want to implement with datatable is at least the following:\n\n- Column-oriented data storage.\n\n- Native-C implementation for all datatypes, including strings. Packages such as pandas and numpy already do that for numeric columns, but not for strings.\n\n- Support for date-time and categorical types. Object type is also supported, but promotion into object discouraged.\n\n- All types should support null values, with as little overhead as possible.\n\n- Data should be stored on disk in the same format as in memory. This will allow us to memory-map data on disk and work on out-of-memory datasets transparently.\n\n- Work with memory-mapped datasets to avoid loading into memory more data than necessary for each particular operation.\n\n- Fast data reading from CSV and other formats.\n\n- Multi-threaded data processing: time-consuming operations should attempt to utilize all cores for maximum efficiency.\n\n- Efficient algorithms for sorting/grouping/joining.\n\n- Expressive query syntax (similar to data.table).\n\n - LLVM-based lazy computation for complex queries (code generated, compiled and executed on-the-fly).\n\n- LLVM-based user-defined functions.\n\n- Minimal amount of data copying, copy-on-write semantics for shared data.\n\n- Use \"rowindex\" views in filtering/sorting/grouping/joining operators to avoid unnecessary data copying.\n\n- Interoperability with pandas / numpy / pure python: the users should have the ability to convert to another data-processing framework with ease.\n\n- Restrictions: Python 3.5+, 64-bit systems only."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About data used in this kernel"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Data has been taken from \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews\n\n- Data is by Griko Nibras.

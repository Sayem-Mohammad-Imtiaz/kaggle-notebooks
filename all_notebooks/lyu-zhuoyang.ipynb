Discussion part\nName:LYU ZHUOYANG\n\nStudent number:21M51935\n\nFrom here I will start the rest part of the homework.\nFirst, I choose Canada to be the target country for this homework. And from the data, we can see that up to today, Canada totally has 1359172 people infected COVID-19, and to be 22nd country in terms of the total numbers of cases.\nAnd total vaccinations per hundred people is 4.49.\n\nFrom the data, we can see that new cases appeared from February 2020 in Canada, and it will arrive first peak in May 3 2020(2760), and then the number decreased. From September 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases increase again, and in Janurary 3 2021 the number became maximum 11.383k. At the same time, around Janurary 2021, people start to vaccinate. And because the influence of vaccine, the number of cases decreased. But unfortunely, from March 2021, the cases increase again. And it arrives the third peak in April 3 2021, and up to today, the number of cases decreases continuously. And the number of vaccination is increasing untill now.\n\nCanada government try to address the issue from lots of aspects. In economic aspect, the government take actions to support canadians and business. For individuals, it provides like employment Insurance program, Canada Recovery Benefit program(provides 500 dollar per week for up to 38 weeks for workers who are not employed or ...)and apprentice loan for student. For business, it also provide Financial support, loan and access to credit. And also it provide public education for citizen to increase awareness and understanding of the disease. For the border, it set travel restrictions. And all international passenger flight arrivals have been redirected to 1 of 4 airports which decided by government. Since May 21, 2020, Canada government has gradually increased its presence at key high-volume ports of entry across Canada, including land borders.\nSo, from those news, we can see that gonvernment has done lots of things to prevent the infected person inbound(travel restriction, entry airport limitation, more staff in borders etc.) broadcast for epidemic prevention(public education) and financial support etc.\n\n\nWith the vaccination rate increase, the cases decrease exactly.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

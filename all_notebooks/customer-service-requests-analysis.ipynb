Each day, NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars. These requests are received by NYC311 and forwarded to the relevant agencies such as the police, buildings, or transportation. The agency responds to the request, addresses it, and then closes it.\n\n#### Problem Objective :\n\nPerform a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. You will focus on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types.\n\n#### Domain: \n###### Customer Service\n\n\n#### Tasks Performed:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Import a 311 NYC service request.</li>\n<li>Read or convert the columns ‘Created Date’ and Closed Date’ to datetime datatype and create a new column ‘Request_Closing_Time’ as the time elapsed between request creation and request closing.</li>\n<li>Provide major insights/patterns that you can offer in a visual format (graphs or tables); at least 4 major conclusions that you can come up with after generic data mining.</li>\n<li>Order the complaint types based on the average ‘Request_Closing_Time’, grouping them for different locations.</li>\n    <li>Perform a statistical tests.</li>\n</ul>\n\nPlease note: For the below statements you need to state the Null and Alternate and then provide a statistical test to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis along with the corresponding ‘p-value’.\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Whether the average response time across complaint types is similar or not (overall)</li>\n<li>Are the type of complaint or service requested and location related?</li>\n    </ul>\n\nWhether the average response time across complaint types is similar or not (overall)\nAre the type of complaint or service requested and location related?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing the Library"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency \n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading the Data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv(\"../input/311-service-requests-nyc/311_Service_Requests_from_2010_to_Present.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Descriptive Analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"color:green\">We see lots of missing value.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SciBERT Embeddings Analysis\nThis is a basic tutorial and analysis of how to download and use BERT models to create naive embeddings, which can be used for exploring concepts in the COVID-19 literature corpus. [SciBERT](https://github.com/allenai/scibert) is a large transformer model trained on scientific text. While this tutorial shows how to use SciBERT, specifically you should be able to reuse the code for any HuggingFace transformer model. Using it allows us to explore several interesting questions:\n\n    1. Are raw embeddings from the language model useful without any further fine-tuning?\n    2. Can we construct a memory efficent semantic search using these embeddings?\n    3. What does the embedding space look like when visualized? Are similar articles clustered together?\n\nOf course long-term we would probably want to use richer embedding, specifically, embeddings from a model trained on this corpus or formed in a richer way. For instance, the embedding method displayed here is a simple MEAN over all the words in the text passage. Possibly more advanced methods would include using sentence transformers or document embedding techniques, but these methods (usually) require annotated training data.

This makes an entirely semantic search impractical (2). \n* BERT cannot accomodate text passages longer than 512 characters which would make it difficult to embed an article's full-text.\n* Visualized clusters of titles seemed to make sense, but could use evaluation by a biology/chemistry/drug expert (3)\n\n## Next Steps\nThere are a bunch of possible next steps so I'm going to split them based on the area. \n\n** Evaluation **\n* Get expert evaluation of title clusters to see if they actually make sense. \n* Figure out a way to plot abstracts in Bokeh in a visually appealing way. Have experts inspect abstract clusters.\n* Continue to run semantic search on groups of returned BM25 results. Get experts to rank results. \n\n\n**Making better embeddings **\n\n* Train a language model specifically on the COVID-19 corpus and evaluate its embeddings versus SciBERT\n* Investigate sentence transformers (pre-trained on MedNLI/SciTail) and explore if these embeddings work better\n* See if anyone has a scientifically trained transformer-XL model  or equivalent.\n\n**Performance/Productionizing**\n\n* Explore and benchmark speed/space constraints of returning larger numbers of BM25 results to re-rank with embeddings.\n* Figure out storage method for embeddings and iteratively embed each article.\n* Research if U-Map as a dimensionality reduction technique can return embeddings. Easier to load 100D into memory then 768D.\n\nHope you enjoyed this analysis. If you found it useful please upvote as it helps more people to see it.

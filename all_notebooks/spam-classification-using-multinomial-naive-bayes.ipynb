This is needes as input Value for the multinomial naive bayes because it can't handle raw test_messages.\n- Transform train and test date into a sparce matrix (rowsxcolumns) which creates a new column for every word in the messages and counts how often they have been used in each message.\n\nExample:\n\nMessage 1: random text text\n\nMessage 2: another random text \n\nAfter transformation: 2x4 sparce matrix (type = integer) with 4 Stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format (one element for each unique word)\n\n                                      Displayed as an Array: array([[0, 1, 2], \n                                                                    [1, 1, 1]] \n                              \n                              Message 1: another = 0x, random = 1x, text = 2x. \n                              Message 2: another = 1x, random = 1x, text = 1x.\n                              \nThis means we will have thousands of columns, one for each word.  One of the strenghts of the (multinomial) naive bayes is that it can handle a lot of data. \n\n#### Filter non-relevant words\n\n- The CountVectoricer allows us to set a minimum and maximum occurence requirement, which allows us to filter out the non-relevant/harmful words (most common/uncommon) which I displayed in the Text (Message) Analytics. This will reduce the amount of columns we train our classifier with. We can use the parameters min_features and max_features to do this. To be sure all stop words are removed, I added the stop_words = 'english' parameter."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3fa0e0e19cc4e7bb55f00e7c003f7decfea2caf1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = df[\"message\"]\ny = df[\"label\"]\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state = 0, test_size = 0.25)\n\ncv = CountVectorizer(min_df = 0.01, max_features = 300, stop_words = 'english') #1% / 300 occurences \ncv.fit(X_train)\n\nX_train = cv.transform(X_train)\nX_test = cv.transform(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4e69f6e947e23c6cd9c6d81c37700ec509314b13"},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = MultinomialNB()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(model.score(X_test, y_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"62c5e77cae41a49e8c41a6a904352a0a78d9425a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Confusion-Matrix\n\nDue to the fact that the already classified data we trained our model with is not very balanced (way more no-spam messages), we don't know if the  R2 score is reliable.

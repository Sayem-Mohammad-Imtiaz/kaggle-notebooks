LDA\n\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation, is an unsupervised generative model that assigns topic distributions to documents.\n\nAt a high level, the model assumes that each document will contain several topics, so that there is topic overlap within a document. The words in each document contribute to these topics. The topics may not be known a priori, and needn't even be specified, but the **number** of topics must be specified a priori. Finally, there can be words overlap between topics, so several topics may share the same words.\n\nThe model generates to **latent** (hidden) variables\n1) A distribution over topics for each document\n2) A distribution over words for each topics\n\nAfter training, each document will have a discrete distribution over all topics, and each topic will have a discrete distribution over all words.\n\nIt is best to demonstrate this with an example. Let's say a document about the presidential elections may have a high contribution from the topics \"presidential elections\", \"america\", \"voting\" but have very low contributions from topics \"himalayan mountain range\", \"video games\", \"machine learning\" (assuming the corpus is varied enough to contain such articles); the topics \"presidential elections\" may have top contributing words [\"vote\",\"election\",\"people\",\"usa\",\"clinton\",\"trump\",...] whereas the top contributing words in the topic \"himalayan mountain range\" may be [\"nepal\",\"everest\",\"china\",\"altitude\",\"river\",\"snow\",....]. This very rough example should give you an idea of what LDA aims to do.\n\nAn important point to note: although I have named some topics in the example above, the model itself does not actually do any \"naming\" or classifying of topics. But by visually inspecting the top contributing words of a topic i.e. the discrete distribution over words for a topic, one can name the topics if necessary after training. We will show this more later.\n\nThere a several ways to implement LDA, however I will speak about collapsed gibbs sampling as I usually find this to be the easiest way to understand it.\n\nThe model initialises by assigning every word in every document to a **random** topic. Then, we iterate through each word, unassign it's current topic, decrement the topic count corpus wide and reassign the word to a new topic based on the local probability of topic assignemnts to the current document, and the global (corpus wide) probability of the word assignments to the current topic. This may be hard to understand in words, so the equations are below."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2a40e5b74b1722e8505d75620c0ee954be64b6af"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The mathematics of collapsed gibbs sampling (cut back version)\n\nRecall that when we iterate through each word in each document, we unassign its current topic assignment and reassign the word to a new topic.

Very briefly, this is because the model infers parameters from observations and if there are not enough observations (words) in a document, the model performs poorly. For short texts, although yet to be rigoursly tested, it may be best to use a [biterm model](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f499/5dc2a4eb901594578e3780a6f33dee02dad1.pdf).\n\nUnlike the word2vec algorithm, which performs extremely well with full structured sentences, LDA is a bag of words model, meaning word order in a document doesnt count. This also means that stopwords and rare words should be excluded, so that the model doesnt overcompensate for very frequent words and very rare words, both of which do not contribute to general topics.\n\n#### Hyperparameters\n\nLDA has 2 hyperparameters: $\\alpha$ and $\\eta$\n\n$\\alpha$ - A low value for $\\alpha$ means that documents have only a low number of topics contributing to them. A high value of $\\alpha$ yields the inverse, meaning the documents appear more alike within a corpus.\n\n$\\eta$ - A low value for $\\eta$ means the topics have a low number of contributing words. A high value of $\\eta$ yields the inverse, meaning topics will have word overlap and appear more alike.\n\nThe values of $\\alpha$ and $\\eta$ really depend on the application, and may need to be tweaked several times before the desired results are found... even then, LDA is non-deterministic since parameters are randomly initialised, so the outcome of any run of the model can never be known in advance."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"829417a9fa15a8bbf4e021bb74ed668d4dfcec90","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def train_lda(data):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function trains the lda model\n    We setup parameters like number of topics, the chunksize to use in Hoffman method\n    We also do 2 passes of the data since this is a small dataset, so we want the distributions to stabilize\n    \"\"\"\n    num_topics = 100\n    chunksize = 300\n    dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(data['tokenized'])\n    corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in data['tokenized']]\n    t1 = time.time()\n    # low alpha means each document is only represented by a small number of topics, and vice versa\n    # low eta means each topic is only represented by a small number of words, and vice versa\n    lda = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary,\n                   alpha=1e-2, eta=0.5e-2, chunksize=chunksize, minimum_probability=0.0, passes=2)\n    t2 = time.time()\n    print(\"Time to train LDA model on \", len(df), \"articles: \", (t2-t1)/60, \"min\")\n    return dictionary,corpus,lda","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e44e222c5a57aae307c952aaee9c914af4ea430d","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"dictionary,corpus,lda = train_lda(train_df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a7e4d96a00d039e7eb7141e46da7658d2f14aaba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Let's inspect some topics!\n\nBear in mind, when we see the words they may seem shortened.

We can do this by comparing the topic distribution of the new document to all the topic distributions of the documents in the corpus. We use the [Jensen-Shannon distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence) metric to find the most similar documents.\n\nWhat the Jensen-Shannon distance tells us, is which documents are statisically \"closer\" (and therefore more similar), by comparing the divergence of their distributions. Jensen-Shannon is symmetric, unlike Kullback-Leibler on which the formula is based. This is good, because we want the similarity between documents A and B to be the same as the similarity between B and A.\n\nThe formula is described below.\n\nFor discrete distirbutions $P$ and $Q$, the Jensen-Shannon divergence, $JSD$ is defined as\n\n$$JSD\\left(P||Q\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}D\\left(P||M\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}D\\left(Q||M\\right)$$\n\nwhere $M = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(P+Q\\right)$\n\nand $D$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence\n\n$$D\\left(P||Q\\right) = \\sum_iP(i)\\log\\left(\\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}\\right)$$\n\n$$\\Rightarrow JSD\\left(P||Q\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i\n\\left[\nP(i)\\log\\left(\\frac{P(i)}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(P(i)+Q(i)\\right)}\\right)\n+\nQ(i)\\log\\left(\\frac{Q(i)}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(P(i)+Q(i)\\right)}\\right)\n\\right]$$\n\nThe square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence is the Jensen-Shannon Distance: $\\sqrt{JSD\\left ( P||Q\\right )}$\n\n**The smaller the Jensen-Shannon Distance, the more similar two distributions are (and in our case, the more similar any 2 documents are)**"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"c3151a3bf152082155a41df161583347282ae0f4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can use the scipy implementation of entropy to do this.

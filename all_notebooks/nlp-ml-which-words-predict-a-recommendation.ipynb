However, there seems to be an issue with Class 0 (would not recommend) across all trained models; looking at the LinearSVC both Precision & Recall are low, contributing towards a mediocre 0.60 F1 score. \n\nMy sense is this is due to class imbalance. As depicted earlier, there are around five times fewer 0 classifications compared to 1 classifications, which can sometimes be problematic within Machine Learning, whereby modelling generally tends to work better when there is an almost equal numbers of samples from each class in the target variable. With this dataset, we're way off that. \n\nTo overcome this problem, we can either DownSample the majority Class or UpSample the minority class. In this notebook I will use an Oversampling technique from the handy SMOTE library. Let's apply this technique and then re-run all four models to re-assess precision & recall performance."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9be6bdfe9a08eb5023e9baab5f09184cc075f048"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Algorithms round 2"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"26c70ab18efd7d9704b02e76739d8243863aa07a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the hopeful solution to our problems\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nsmote=SMOTE()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"491b39e696783285b4d69d131d932ee35832c920"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Setting up new variables for ML\nX_sm, y_sm = smote.fit_sample(X,y)\n\nX_train_sm, X_test_sm, y_train_sm, y_test_sm = train_test_split(X_sm, y_sm, test_size=0.3, random_state=100)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"e7af8e4e55af97e0e299dffcc8cf8994e8765036"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Defining a new function with revised inputs for the new SMOTE variables\ndef model_sm(mod, model_name, x_train_sm, y_train_sm, x_test_sm, y_test_sm):\n    mod.fit(x_train_sm, y_train_sm)\n    print(model_name)\n    acc = cross_val_score(mod, X_train_sm, y_train_sm, scoring = \"accuracy\", cv = 5)\n    predictions = cross_val_predict(mod, X_train_sm, y_train_sm, cv = 5)\n    print(\"Accuracy:\", round(acc.mean(),3))\n    cm = confusion_matrix(predictions, y_train_sm)\n    print(\"Confusion Matrix:  \\n\", cm)\n    print(\"                    Classification Report \\n\",classification_report(predictions, y_train_sm))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"2162390832fff2e627d63068e3b4e0671bdc4ae4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 1.

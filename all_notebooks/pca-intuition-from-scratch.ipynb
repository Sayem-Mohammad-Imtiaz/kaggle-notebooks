PCA provides the advantage reducing computational costs and errors during paramter estimation by reducing the number of dimensions in the data to a subspace which 'best' describes the data. Primarly applications of PCA is for pattern recognition, classification, dimensionality reduction.

Think of it as a basketball&mdash;with concentric cirlces going from top to bottom like in the picture&mdash;which you can stretch or squeeze both vertically and/or horizontally but cannot twist or deform it in a way that the lines on its surface no longer remain parallel. It follows the constraints of a linear transformation in that respect. \n\nIf our underlying pattern, or function is found on the tip of the ellipsoid, then imagine all the features spread across the different axeses of the ellipsoid. If an axis is small, then variance of the feature spread on that axis is also small. By omitting that axis and the principal component (feature) associated with that axis, we reduce our feature space and only lose a commensurately small amount of information. \n\nReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis\n\n**Note**: PCA does **not** improve accuracy. It is a method to reduce dimensions in order to improve computation, reduce noise, and it can also be used as a regularizing method to prevent overfitting. However, it usually does not make any difference when it comes to accuracy. \n\nPCA can also be thought of as an unsupervised algorithm since it ignores the class labels and the goal is to find the principal components (or directions) that maximize the variance in the dataset.\n\n![Ellipsoide](https://i.imgur.com/ehwizHt.png)\n### Linear Algebra\n**Eigen-stuff**: Whenever a linear space goes through a scalar transformation, the vector space only gets scaled or squeezed, there is no rotation or direction change in the vector space which offsets the vectors of their spans. In matrix transformations though the vectors do get knocked off their span because the vector space gets rotated and squished and stretched as well. However, in certain cases of vector transformations, there are some vectors in the vector space which&mdash;despite undergoing a matrix transformation&mdash;do not get knocked off their span and retain it. These vectors are known as Eigenvectors (also known as proper vectors). \n\nThey merely get squeezed or stretched like during a scalar transformation. The magnitude of difference between their length before the transformation and their length after the transformation are known as Eigenvalues.\n\nReference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g\n\nWe want to use this same principle to find the eigenvectors for the covariance matrix of our dataset. The covariance matrix describes how one feature covaries with respect to the other feature. Finding the eigenvectors of this feature space will help us identify the magnitude of the span of each feature vector (also known as eigenvalues). If the span (axis) is small, then the variance of the feature spread on that axis is also small and we can drop it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a4df35f9a6e29618fa646e211999264a7dbb2cf2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Steps\n\n1.

It has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. Observations have been made since 1998 and have been made accessible to everyone who is interested.\n\nFor this purpose a special 2.5 m diameter telescope was built at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, USA. The telescope uses a camera of 30 CCD-Chips with 2048x2048 image points each. The chips are ordered in 5 rows with 6 chips in each row. Each row observes the space through different optical filters (u, g, r, i, z) at wavelengths of approximately 354, 476, 628, 769, 925 nm.\n\nThe telescope covers around one quarter of the earth's sky&mdash;therefore focuses on the northern part of the sky.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b844f35169b51dabcda57ce910b2e4f0f5b727f1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing required libraries\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ncmap = sns.color_palette(\"Blues\")\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e8d1e56df69a0b1960e68e2a54f80997e45610f0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing in the data\nsky = pd.read_csv(\"../input/Skyserver_SQL2_27_2018 6_51_39 PM.csv\")\n\n#taking a peek at the data\nsky.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d2a8f68dd36d061acfaba15960ce4f9fb97239e5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature Description\n\n**Camera Features**\n\n- objid = Object Identifier\n- ra = J2000 Right Ascension (r-band)\n- dec = J2000 Declination (r-band)\n\n**Right ascension (abbreviated ra)** is the angular distance measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the hour circle of the point above the earth in question.

The field number typically starts at 11 (after an initial rampup time), and can be as large as 800 for particularly long runs.\n- An additional number, rerun, specifies how the image was processed.\n\n**Physics Features**\n\n- specobjid = Object Identifier\n- class = object class (galaxy, star or quasar object)\n\n**The class identifies an object to be either a galaxy, star or quasar.

These fibers then feed into the spectrographs. Each plate has a unique serial number, which is called plate in views such as SpecObj in the CAS.\n\n**Modified Julian Date (mjd)**, used to indicate the date that a given piece of SDSS data (image or spectrum) was taken.\n\nThe SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light at the focal plane from individual objects to the slithead.

The signs do not have any effect on the variance of the vector because the span remains the same. \n\nNow, let's do the same with mjd and plate."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"51746862b44ccfdf65b146a5e9bedd29d1c77123"},"cell_type":"code","source":"pca = PCA(n_components=1)\nmjdplate = pca.fit_transform(sky[['mjd','plate']])\nmjdplate","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"525f9e8fa0f0f140ee7c803d59552fee4af33b86"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's update our data with the PCA columns."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f36b316d3baaf00a5dbe4162cd3acddfddc21103"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# update dataframe \nsky_pca = pd.concat((sky, pd.DataFrame(ugriz)), axis=1)\nsky_pca.rename({0: 'bands_1', 1: 'bands_2', 2: 'bands_3'}, axis=1, inplace = True)\nsky_pca = pd.concat((sky_pca, pd.DataFrame(mjdplate)), axis =1)\nsky_pca.rename({0: 'mjdplate_1'}, axis=1, inplace = True)\n\nsky_pca.drop(['u','g','r','i','z'], axis = 1, inplace=True)\n\n#Encoding the class variables to quantitative variables\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nle = LabelEncoder()\ny_encoded = le.fit_transform(sky_pca['class'])\nsky_pca['class'] = y_encoded\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0f6631a4163c3c8842eef4c0ad6b1bd1a0c0e56c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sky_pca.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c58413ca830432419a4e0a305bbab09c507befe3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's extract the feature vectors and class vector separately for classification."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2986b85708dc7106d86969721f0cb8e0c3fcb8bc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = sky_pca[['bands_1','bands_2','bands_3','redshift','ra','dec','fiberid','mjdplate_1']].values\ny = sky_pca[['class']].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"449b35069958f127799b7267037527f401fdc0b3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Standardization/Normalization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b9e6b34e81de5cbb4f5f916e2a16472ecbf6a6bf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nss = StandardScaler()\nX_scaled = ss.fit_transform(X)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"01410556a1e7f75c68dbbada0033e6646202e516"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Train-Test Split"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"63d642bf26ce5ab41559df303523d832e3f6d59b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 420)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0f15d6b07c7337bce7c44f3c3c5918e2b4cb3fb6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Logistic Regression"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"43ae41864f3d650b0911cb2a2c3c509c611fdda9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nLG = LogisticRegression(penalty=\"l2\")\nLG.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"927f5e7f391d15feb6e804ad44ed06dd18c36030"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Assessment"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"365f4e511d846e3e58dc70132f9f1e7299eba517"},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_preds = LG.predict(X_test)\naccuracy = LG.score(X_test,y_test)\n\nprint(f\"Accuracy of Logistic Model: {accuracy*100}%\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1ba6a530ffaa00a3bede910af2982aefa001dfa2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Plotting the confusion matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport seaborn as sns\nss, sg, sq, gs, gg, gq, qs, qg, qq = confusion_matrix(y_test,y_preds).ravel()\ncm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_preds)\nax = plt.subplot()\nsns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, ax = ax, fmt=\"g\", cmap=\"Blues_r\");

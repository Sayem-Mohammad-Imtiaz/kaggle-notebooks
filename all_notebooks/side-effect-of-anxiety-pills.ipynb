However, these half not enough for some brain dysfunction such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and anxiety. \nAlso, the number of the doctor who tries to find a cure society is as equal as the number of doctors who diagnose that dysfunction. In that kernel, we study 2 pills which are given by Steve Ahn and these pills use for anxiety treatment.  \n\n**What is the anxiety?**\nAnxiety is the body's natural response to stress. When you were fired your job or broke up your relationship, Your body release Cortisol which causes stress. You think rapidly that okay if cortisol causes stress, we get rid of that f*cking shit.\nI cannot explain why that bad idea is but I can give an idea.\nFirstly we cannot get rid of that because hormones are produced by the hormone system which spread the human body plus We cannot understand the human body effectively. All in all, we try to use some pills to press the adrenal medulla. However, these pills every time have side effect for the human body because we do not know that which chemical molecules affect where.  \n\n\n**What we have ?**\nWe have Alprazolam (C17H13ClN4) and Triazolam (C17H12Cl2N4) also the Suger pill and some memory score whom attendance.\n\nAlprazolam ::\n\nAlprazolam is long-term medicine for anxiety. Common side effects which I found on the internet are sleepiness, depression, headaches, dry mouth, memory problem.\n\nTriazolam ::\n\nTriazolam is used for sleepness problem but That pill is a hardworking guy and It affects more than one disorder. I do not know that is exactly true, Wikipedia told that. Also, this is short-term medicine."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data import time "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"memory = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/memory-test-on-drugged-islanders-data/Islander_data.csv\")\nmemory[\"Drug_num\"] = memory.Drug.map({\"A\":1,\"T\":2,\"S\":3})\nmemory[\"HSgnum\"] = memory.Happy_Sad_group.map({\"H\":1,\"S\":2})\nmemory.Drug_num = memory.Drug_num.astype(int)\nmemory.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Drug vs Placebo\n\nPlacebo is the most complicated effect on human psychology and most time that sh*t affect the all drug experiment.And you can see  that experiment was affected by placebo."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"layer =go.Scatter3d(x=memory.Drug,y=memory.Dosage,z=memory.Diff,mode=\"markers\",\n             marker= dict(size=7,colorscale=[[0, 'crimson'], [0.5, 'gold'], [1.0, 'darkgray']],color=memory.Drug_num) )\n\nlayout = go.Layout(margin=dict(l=0,r=0,t=100,b=0),title=\"Drug type & resualt\")\n\ndata =[layer]\n\nfig = go.Figure(data =data ,layout=layout)\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Memory result  (Without placebo)  \n\nWe caught the placebo a few minutes ago because of that we get rid of the sugar pill.

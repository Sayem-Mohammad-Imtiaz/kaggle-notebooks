I won’t go into the technical details but you should understand these concepts in detail if you wish to apply them more effectively. ARIMA stands for **Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages**. The ARIMA forecasting for a stationary time series is nothing but a linear (like a linear regression) equation. The predictors depend on the parameters (p,d,q) of the ARIMA model:\n\n* **Number of AR (Auto-Regressive) terms (p):** AR terms are just lags of dependent variable. For instance if p is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be x(t-1)….x(t-5).\n\n* **Number of MA (Moving Average) terms (q):** MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction equation. For instance if q is 5, the predictors for x(t) will be e(t-1)….e(t-5) where e(i) is the difference between the moving average at ith instant and actual value.\n\n* **Number of Differences (d):** These are the number of nonseasonal differences, i.e. in this case we took the first order difference. So either we can pass that variable and put d=0 or pass the original variable and put d=1. Both will generate same results.\n\nAn importance concern here is how to determine the value of ‘p’ and ‘q’. We use two plots to determine these numbers. Lets discuss them first.\n\n**Autocorrelation Function (ACF):** It is a measure of the correlation between the the TS with a lagged version of itself. For instance at lag 5, ACF would compare series at time instant ‘t1’…’t2’ with series at instant ‘t1-5’…’t2-5’ (t1-5 and t2 being end points).\n\n**Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):** This measures the correlation between the TS with a lagged version of itself but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons. Eg at lag 5, it will check the correlation but remove the effects already explained by lags 1 to 4.\n***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lag_acf = acf(ts_log_diff, nlags = 20)\nlag_pacf = pacf(ts_log_diff, nlags=20, method = 'ols')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(lag_acf, label='acf')\nplt.plot(lag_pacf, label='pacf')\nplt.legend(loc='upper right')\nplt.axhline(y=-1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\nplt.axhline(y=1.96/np.sqrt(len(ts_log_diff)),linestyle='--',color='gray')\n\n# We set the range from 0 to 5 after analising the full chart, to find the exact number \n#for acf and pacf where it crosses the confidence limits\nplt.xlim([0, 5]) ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The p,d,q values can be specified using the order argument of ARIMA which take a tuple (p,d,q).\n\n* **p –** The lag value where the **PACF** chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time.

Naturally, these actions make some customers super valuable in terms of lifetime value but there are always some customers who pull down the profitability. We need to identify these behavior patterns, segment customers and act accordingly.\nCalculating Lifetime Value is the easy part. First we need to select a time window. It can be anything like 3, 6, 12, 24 months. By the equation below, we can have Lifetime Value for each customer in that specific time window:\n\n**Lifetime Value: Total Gross Revenue - Total Cost**\n\nThis equation now gives us the historical lifetime value. If we see some customers having very high negative lifetime value historically, it could be too late to take an action. \n\nWe are going to build a simple machine learning model that predicts our customers lifetime value.\n\n<h3>Lifetime Value Prediction</h3>\n\n* Define an appropriate time frame for Customer Lifetime Value calculation\n* Identify the features we are going to use to predict future and create them\n* Calculate lifetime value (LTV) for training the machine learning model\n* Build and run the machine learning model\n* Check if the model is useful\n\n**1. How to decide the timeframe**\n\nDeciding the time frame really depends on your industry, business model, strategy and more. For some industries, 1 year is a very long period while for the others it is very short. In our example, we will go ahead with 6 months.\n\n**2. Identifying the features for prediction**\n\nRFM scores for each customer ID (which we calculated in the previous article) are the perfect candidates for feature set. To implement it correctly, we need to split our dataset. We will take 3 months of data, calculate RFM and use it for predicting next 6 months. So we need to create two dataframes first and append RFM scores to them.\n\nAfter the first two steps, it is easy to calculate CLTV and train and test the model.\n\n- <a href='#1'>1.

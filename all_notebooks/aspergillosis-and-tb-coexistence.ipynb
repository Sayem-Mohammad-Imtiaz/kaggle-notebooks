ABPA occurs predominantly in patients with underlying chronic airway disorders. Pulmonary tuberculosis is one of the most common chronic pulmonary infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis in developing countries. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and those requiring immunosuppressive therapies are more susceptible to tuberculosis. The occurrence of ABPA in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis has been rarely reported. Some of them are cases of ABPA developed in patients with previous histories of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the others are cases of ABPA misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nPercutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy was performed, and histologic examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with staining as well as for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterium.\nThe resection specimen showed bronchiectasis with mucus plug and fungal hyphae, morphologically consistent with Aspergillus species and PCR analysis for M. tuberculosis. \n\n On the basis of these findings, they confirmed diagnosis of coexistent ABPA and active pulmonary tuberculosis in the same lobe.\n https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/ajrccm.183.1.137","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import feature_extraction, linear_model, model_selection, preprocessing\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#ABPA (Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) and TB\n\nAlthough there are typical radiologic findings of ABPA and pulmonary tuberculosis, it is not easy to diagnose these two diseases when they present with atypical radiologic pattern, especially in asymptomatic patients. In areas with a high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis, patients with ABPA are often misdiagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis and treated with antituberculosis drugs for a long time. \n\nTherefore, pulmonary tuberculosis developed in patients with ABPA may be difficult to recognize radiologically without a clinical suspicion. In the present case, chest CT and MRI showed mucoid impaction and central bronchiectasis, suggesting ABPA. There were no radiographic findings or clinical features of active pulmonary tuberculosis. However, during the evaluation process to confirm the cause for chronic granulomatous inflammation, active pulmonary tuberculosis was incidentally diagnosed through surgical excision.\n\nIn conclusion, this first case of coexistent ABPA and active pulmonary tuberculosis suggest that pulmonary tuberculosis should be carefully evaluated in patients with ABPA, particularly those in the endemic area.\n\nhttps://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/ajrccm.183.1.137","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsaspergilluscsv/aspergillus.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'aspergillus.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Aspergillosis and Covid-19\n\n#Confirmed Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis and COVID-19: the value of postmortem findings to support antemortem management\n\nRev.

Autopsies of COVID-19 confirmed cases were performed. The patient died despite antimicrobials, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor support. Histopathology and peripheral blood galactomannan antigen testing confirmed IPA. Aspergillus penicillioides infection was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and BLAST analysis. Further reports are needed to assess the occurrence and frequency of IPA in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and how they interact clinically.\n\nIt is possible that aspergillosis could predispose patients with COVID-19 to clinical worsening, and it is therefore necessary to further assess this two-way interaction between both infections.\n\nIn their case, no CT imaging of the lung, sequential GM, or culture for fungus was performed, thus reinforcing the role of autopsies as a form of postmortem surveillance of such a severe disease. As the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, further reports are needed to assess the occurrence and frequency of IPA (Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis )in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and their clinical interaction. These studies are needed to assess the incidence of IPA and define at-risk populations, thus offering a strategy for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and timely clinical management.https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0037-86822020000100719&script=sci_arttext","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRftBldDTQ7Y5j1JQ0FwF2rc8yvsqBw_ZwSTw&usqp=CAU)kncvtbc.org","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#COVID-19–associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis\n\nAuthors: Andreas L.

Here, they describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19–associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA - CAPA = COVID-19–associated pulmonary aspergillosis;) cases and the frequency in our ICU. \n\nEleven ICU patients with COVID-19 developed a secondary infection, of whom six (19.4%) were presumed to have IPA. They identified Aspergillus fumigatus in five patients, and in three patients, the Aspergillus antigen galactomannan (GM) (Platelia Aspergillus; Biorad) was found positive on BAL fluid. Three patients had preexisting lung diseases, but none were positive for the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) host factor. Serum GM tested negative in three patients.\n\nThey observed a high incidence (19.4%) of presumed aspergillosis in our cohort of 31 ICU patients, which might indicate that patients with COVID-19 are at risk for developing IPA.\n\nAlthough 94% of patients with IAPA (Influenza-associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis)had positive BAL GM and 71% had positive serum GM in a retrospective ICU study (9), the performance of GM in BAL and serum of patients with CAPA remains to be further evaluated, as it may differ from IAPA. Indeed, in three of our patients with CAPA, circulating GM was not detected in serum. In one patient, the serum GM index was 0.4, which is borderline negative. Including our case series, to date, 22 ICU patients have been reported with presumed CAPA (5–8). Only three patients tested GM-positive in serum. It is important to investigate the diagnostic value of serum GM in CAPA, as there is a general reluctance to perform bronchoscopy in patients with COVID-19 because of the risks for the patient and the pulmonologist.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7328331/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features with missing values\ncategorical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>1 and df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint(categorical_nan)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSOklr37pFSnRdGpJD6pAyceaxmLJEcvo_c-g&usqp=CAU)thehague.worldlunghealth.org","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"SARS-CoV-2 infection might be a risk factor for IPA, and early diagnosis and prompt treatment for CAPA in ICU patients seems warranted because high mortality rates have been reported. \n\nThe diagnosis of IAPA has controversies because varying frequencies of the infection have been reported in ICU influenza studies.\n\nIn their center, on suspicion of CAPA (COVID-19–associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis), a diagnostic workup is performed that includes serum GM and, if feasible, bronchoscopy with BAL for fungal culture and GM.

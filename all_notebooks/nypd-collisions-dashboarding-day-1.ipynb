It imght be difficult to provide that a view at that fine granularity without using an interactive map (zooming in and out or typing in an address). Utlimately, that would be one feature a dashboard will need and therefore the exact LATITUDE and LONGITUDE of a collision will be important.\n\n**__What will affect the choices you or others will need to make?__**  \nThe total number of collision by location will inform how dangerous an interction is, as will a breakdown by the type of person either killed or injured. I also think that an understanding of factors contributing to the collision might inforn law makers and/or enforment officials of how to improve safety.\n\n**_What changes have you made?_**  \nNone"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"695ff474a53444224823e6b916d3bbfc26edabac"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"collisions = pd.read_csv('../input/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions.csv')\ncollisions.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5c49889979123741558e223c7511c909c0754d32"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Distribution of Collisions by Borough\ncollisions['BOROUGH'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a26d532b2da2b9738b2081cdc064b7342546b594"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Look at only Collisions where a person was either killed or injured\n(collisions\n    .loc[(collisions[\"NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED\"] > 0) | collisions[\"NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED\"] > 0]\n    .loc[:,'BOROUGH']\n    .value_counts()\n    .plot(kind='bar')\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"90e9d6aa8e74b76c80c6256f47a5fe41d0e302b1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Deadliest collisions\n\n(collisions\n     .iloc[collisions.groupby(\"BOROUGH\")[\"NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED\"].idxmax()]\n     .loc[:,['DATE', 'BOROUGH']]\n     .sort_values(by='DATE', ascending=False)\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"069e6f3bc65206b9c4c2ce1ac971d123cb3592bc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Distribution of Collisions by Date\n# Time of day not recorded\n\ncollisions['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(collisions['DATE'], format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")\ncollisions['DATE'].value_counts().resample('m').sum().plot.line()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7ec3716d9f384135cb6b2553129628704e8a9234"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Causes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Although their percentage is increasing over the years, more work has to be done to have equal contributions from all communities.\n\n- Most of the working professionals have atleast a bachelor's degree and around 40% of them had a Master's Degree. So it seems that a Bachelor's degree is important for pursuing a career in Computer Science field.\n\n- Almost 60% of the Bachelor's degree holders have their major as Computer Science. But around 15% has their major other than Computer Science so it is very encouraging. It seems that a degree in the field of Computer Science might not be neccessary if you have enough skills.\n\n- Most of the programmers work as Full-Time employees but around 13% are self-employeed which is very encouraging for the begineers.\n\n- Most of the programmers seems to be working around 40 hours per week.\n\n- It is not important to start programming at young age. People above 30 years of age can start programming and make career in it.\n\n- Most of the people have been exposed to programming at leat once in their life. This shows the importance of having at least basic programming skills regardless of any field one is in.\n\n- Full time employeed work the most in a week but intrestingly, self-emlployeed and part-time employees also work almost same number of hours so it is highly possible that the dataset might be biased.","metadata":{}}]}

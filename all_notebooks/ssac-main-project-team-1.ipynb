WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER was the bestseller and also had a lot of resale. It was possible to categorize the main products through the sales ranking, high purchase rate and reorganize products with a low purchase rate and also reorganize the product composition plan\n\n\n 4. As a result of analyzing the product names by word unit, the popular product names were such as'SET','RETROSPOT', \"VINTAGE\", \"DESIGN\", and \"CHRISTMAS.\" It may not be able to identify the exact product category, but it can analyzed that this E-Commerce does not only sell specific product group but also various products groups.\n \n \n 5. Most of the transactions took place around 12 o'clock, and November was the most trading volume and sales, and the number of transactions increased with the end of the year. Over time, the rate of repurchases and regular purchases also increased.\n \n \n 6.  We don't know whether it is an online business based in the UK or neighboring countries, but we can guess as the UK accounted for 89% of the volume of transactions, with the highest total sales. The average of the transaction amount per item purchased was the highest in the Netherlands, which indicates that the Netherlands is purchasing products at a high price, although the total sales are not high.\n \n \n 7.

It was possible to divide the purchase rate of customers who made the first purchase and customers who made reorders (reorders) on a monthly basis.

In the original data, it was excluded from the pre-processing process, but there were cases where the purchase was refunded for 80,000 pieces per purchase. If this situation is repeated, a request for confirmation of the refund is proposed to the purchasing customer.\n2. Through the EDA process, we saw the state that the repurchase rate and the regular purchase rate were maintained well, and we can see that the site (shopping mall) is operating well. However, in order to develop, we need to run promotions for seasonal customers, which are 99% of our customers. Here are some options.\n   - In addition to widening the coverage of products for seasonal customers in a specific month, the purchase width is increased by gradually introducing products similar to those purchased by seasonal customers.\n   - Increase the discount range applied per product, and if a large purchase is made by more than a certain quantity, through contacts such as email with customers, give out various services such as shipping costs, discounts, seasonal promotion coupons, individual promotions to provide increased loyalty to the site.\n3. Give benefits for promotions such as coupons and discount events for each rating by creating a rating for each customer. However,start the basic group as a VIP so the lower group is not alienated. When a purchase is made as a customer who has a ID, give the VIP level immediately. Also make the first purchaser also proceed with promotions such as a discount on the first purchase and a free shipping coupon. This classifies the frequency of purchase by class, which can be a strategy for customized promotions for each customer. Also, since regular customers who are Silver VIPs are important customers who account for 30% of sales, they provide many discounts and services. In addition, since the number of Silver VIP and Gold VIP is small, communication with dedicated staff per customer can be provided.One thing to be aware of is the consignment customers who will become Gold VIPs, however, since they are doing a consignment business, they aim for profits between purchases, and if there is a cheaper seller, they can move to the place of purchase immediately. For them, thorough delivery times, delivery conditions must be kept at the best, and periodic price comparisons must be made to ensure that cheaper products are not listed in tight, and unique and special items must be maintained on the current site.\n   - Group 0,1(Seasonal Customer) : VIP\n   - Group 2 (Loyal Customer) : Silver VIP\n   - Group 3 (Dropshipper) : Gold VIP\n4. Promote Seasonal, holiday, and anniversary promotions by country. If the data is set in advance on the delivery date and sales start date of the products necessary for the national event day, It will be able to establish itself as the product group that generates the largest sales of the month even it is not a product that generates continuous sales. This will give you a corporate image that you can quickly and easily purchase anniversary event products for the site at low prices through the same promotion every year.\n5.

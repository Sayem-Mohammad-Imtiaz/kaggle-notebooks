"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Description\nFor this problem, we use the MNIST data which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and the actual number between 0-9 is the label. \n\nSince each image is of 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel forms a feature, there are 784 features. MNIST digit recognition is a well-studied problem in the ML community, and people have trained numerous models (Neural Networks, SVMs, boosted trees etc.) achieving error rates as low as 0.23% (i.e. accuracy = 99.77%, with a convolutional neural network).\n\nBefore the popularity of neural networks, though, models such as SVMs and boosted trees were the state-of-the-art in such problems.

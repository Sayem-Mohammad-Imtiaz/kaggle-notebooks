After a contextual [introduction](#introduction), we will start with [data selection and cleaning](#data), followed by interactive [visualization and exploration](#viz). In the second half of the project, we will gain deeper insights by employing [statistical inference](#stats) and [machine learning](#ml) methods.\n\n## Introduction <a id=\"introduction\"></a>\nEurope is a vast and diverse continent and its population is a fascinating subject for sociological studies. The [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) provides great data sets for exactly that purpose. According to their own description, *\"The European Social Survey (ESS) is an academically driven cross-national survey that has been conducted across Europe since its establishment in 2001. Every two years, face-to-face interviews are conducted with newly selected, cross-sectional samples. The survey measures the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of diverse populations in more than thirty nations.\"*. This data set contains the results of the 8th round of the ESS surveyed in 2016/17.\n\nWe may wonder, how do the citizens of European countries think about certain social issues?  What about climate change, politics, immigration, individual well-being? How do people's opinions and beliefs differ within a country or among the countries? I'm personally interested in these questions because I have been roaming around Asia for a long time but soon I may return to Europe. I've been quite disconnected from my home country but I heard the horror stories about anti-democratic political parties on the rise, anti-immigration tendencies, people denying climate change, and so on. One can easily get the impression from the media that many unhappy or dissatisfied about a lot of things. That's scary enough to make me want to check some actual numbers instead of listening to all the flashy headlines. Follow along while I dig into this data set to see what I should expect when I get back home to Europe soon. Oh, one more thing before we start: for whatever reason Israel took part in this survey; last time I checked Israel was not in Europe, but hey, welcome on board friends."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of contents\n1.

The 534 columns each represent one variable corresponding to a question asked in the survey. We have 44387 rows, each corresponding to one surveyed person. \n\nWhen dealing with a lot of numbers, it can be too easy to forget what is actually behind them - so at this point we should remind ourselves that each of these rows corresponds to a real human being who took the time for this survey. A human who answered all these questions, some of which were probably hard to reflect on. And in some of these rows, we will probably be able to read some really sad stories and personal tragedies. We should be grateful towards these people and appreciate their contribution to our scientific understanding, and we should use the knowledge we gain from this data to contribute to the well-being of all people.\n\nNow, regarding the **data selection and cleaning**, there is a lot to do before we can use the data properly, so let's go through some important points:\n- The variables are grouped in topics such as media and social trust, politics, subjective well-being, social issues, climate change etc. which contain important infomation for us, but also administrative variables (such as interview dates) and interview code variables which I will not consider here. There are also variables for specific countries (e.g. about specific political parties) which I will not consider either.\n- There are sampling stratification weights for each person and population weights for each country given which should usually be applied when calculating average aggregated values. I will not use them here though, because I am also interested in the whole distribution of the data, the spread of answers given, and multiplying these weights would greatly distort individuals' responses.\n- The ordinal answers to questions are not all on the same scale (e.g. 1 to 5 vs. 0 to 10) and some of the scales seem to be in reverse order with respect to how the corresponding question was phrased. Maybe this was done to avoid leading questions in the survey. I will reverse the order of these scale when it makes sense to me. Please refer to the survey documentation for more details.\n- Invalid answers (e.g. refusal, don't know, missing) are sometimes encoded with numbers 66, 77, 99 for the larger scales, sometimes with 6, 7, 8, 9 for the smaller scales, sometimes it's mixed. Generally, there are a lot of different ways of how the question encoding was designed. This  may be the result of many different groups of people working on this survey.\n\nDue to this many quite specific tasks, I manually went through the documentation, retrieved (hopefully) all the information needed for the cleaning, and saved it in a file named `variables.csv`.

I will also not consider the nominal answers (e.g. occupation, educational degree, political party voted for, country of birth, maritial status etc.) with a few exceptions: I want to see differences among the countries (`cntry`) and among genders (`gndr`, only 9 people in the whole survey did not categorize themselves as either male or female so we will consider only these two genders here).

There are the following three sub-plots:\n\n- The first sub-plot is a line graph that shows how one variable behaves as a function of another variable (e.g. how healthy are people vs. how happy are people). The variable on the X-axis stays in its original binned (e.g. integer scale 0 to 10) form. For the variable on the Y-axis, the values are randomly jittered a little bit and the median, first quartile (Q1), and third quartile (Q3), corresponding to each X-value, are calculated. An example: For all the people who answered X with a certain value, take their answers to Y, jitter them a little bit to create a more continuous scale, calculate median, Q1, and Q3. I decided to take the median as a central tendency and the interquartile range (IQR) (instead of mean and standard deviation) because some of the variables' distributions are quite skewed (meaning they have longer tails on one side), and this can be nicely seen if Q1's and Q3's absolute distance from the median is unequal. The dropdown menus allow to select which variables are displayed and to filter the sub-plot by country.\n- The second and third sub-plots are bar charts that show the mean values (and the standard deviation as lines around the bar tops) for variables X and Y, respectively, for each country. The countries are sorted according to the mean value of the variable, the highest being on the left. Note that this means that the X-axis for these two plots are generally not the same. You can use your mouse to hover over the bars and display the exact values for mean and standard deviation, also given separately for female and male respondents.\n\nNote that since the answers in the survey were not encoded on identical scales, **the sub-plots do not necessarily have the same Y-axis range**. Another technical note: Once you create the plot a second time, you cannot update the first one anymore because the new one took the notebook hable which bokeh uses to update figures in notebooks.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# make our first plot\ness_plot()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can, unsurprisingly, see in the plots above that people who feel healthy are also happier.

If you have a look at the plots on the right, you can see that Israel (very European) feels the healthiest and Switzerland, probably due to chocolate, feels the happiest.

Let's for example compare the two European countries I've lived in: Germany and Sweden.

And even if we can be confident that an observed difference is probably not just due to random fluctuation, is its magnitude large enough to be meaningful at all? To answer these questions  we'll dive into the realm of statistical hypothesis testing and the effect sizes we can deduce from such tests.\n\nThe next couple of cells contain a somewhat lengthy theory recap on parametric and non-parametric null hypothesis significance testing, error control, and effect sizes.

I want to test my hypotheses on the same data which I used to generate them! I built the visualization first before planning the rest of the project, that's why. But th[](http://)is means that I'm not strictly separating my exploratory research from my confirmatory research which should always be done if possible. Exploring a data set with somewhat flexible methodology and a lot of comparisons will inflate my false positive rate (type 1 error). Often, apparently significant insights from exploration will [fail to replicate](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/15/precognition-studies-curse-failed-replications) in a confirmation study. I think this idea is comparable to a common problem in machine learning: overfitting to the training data and then being surprised that the model generalizes poorly to new data. That's why we keep a holdout set (which I'll get to later again). Using Richard Fineman's words: *\"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\"* If you want to confirm a theory without fooling yourself (too much), a great idea is to pre-register your methodology (e.g. with a scientific journal if you work in academia or with the experimentation team at your company). In the present case, however, our sample size of about 2000 respondents per country is so large that this is hopefully not much of a problem here.\n\nOkay, now back to testing. In this example, we want to compare two samples and see if they are different from each other (alternative hypothesis) or if they might come from the same population and the observed difference might be due to random fluctuations (null hypothesis). If we talk about probabilities in this (frequentist) context, we consider probabilities as long-term frequencies of the data we observe, assuming a hypothesis is true. If we would repeat our sampling process an infinite amount of times, the frequency with which the observed data would appear would correspond to its probability under the given hypothesis. In null hypothesis significance testing, depending on the situation, there are a lot of different test statistics that can be calculated. Based on this statistics one can obtain a probability for how likely the observed data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This probability is called the p-value. This is not a magical number that tells you how likely you think it is that any of the hypotheses is true or false (for that you may want to use Bayesian concepts); it simply is the probability of observing the data assuming the null is true. If the p-value is very small, the data would be very surprising if the null was true. \n\nHow surprising does it have to be to be willing to reject the null? That's up to us. We (completely subjectively) choose a significance level, $\\alpha$ (often chosen to be 0.05). If p falls under $\\alpha$ we decide to reject the null. Same here, $\\alpha$ is not a magical number that tells us how true or false a hypothesis is. For any give test, a hypothesis is either true or not (probability 1 or 0). Instead, $\\alpha$ is what we chose as the highest possible false positive (type 1 error) rate we are willing to accept. Given e.g. $\\alpha$=5% that means, in the long run, if we were to repeat the experiment an infinite amount of times, we would incorrectly reject the null (make a type 1 error) at most 5% of the time. With $\\alpha$=5%, in the long run, 1 out of every 20 test results might be a false positive. Of course, we can also find false negatives (type 2 error rate, $\\beta$, not finding a significant effect when it's actually there). The quantity 1-$\\beta$ is known as statistical power and it represents the probability of finding a significant effect when it is really there. It depends on $\\alpha$, the sample size, and the effect size. If you want to get a more intuitive understanding of error rates, check out [this amazing animation](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/).\n\nThere is one more aspect we have to consider for properly controlling the false positive rate. As discussed above, the more tests we perform, the higher the chance that one of them will be a false positive (finding a significant result just by chance). That means, if we perform multiple comparisons, we have to lower each test's significance level to keep the overall $\\alpha$ at the desired level. The most straightforward approach is probably the [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction) which just divides $\\alpha$ by the number of tests for each test. However, it assumes that all of the hypothesis tests are statistically independent which is most likely not the case. That means it will be overly conservative and reduce the tests' power more than necessary. I think being conservative is not much of a problem here due to the large sample size (and hence, inherently high power), but we could also have chosen to control the false positive rate via the [false discovery rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we should figure out which test statistic to use. We want to compare if, and to what extent, two groups (in our example the respondents from Germany and Sweden) are different from each other or if they are, statistically speaking, from the same underlying population. A very common choice would be a two-independent-sample [Student's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) which tests if the means of two groups are significantly different. One assumption of this test is that the two groups have equal variance (homoscedasticity). This could for example be tested by [Levene's test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test) and in case the assumption is violated, one can perform [Welch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test) version of the t-test which accounts for  unequal variances. Another important assumption is that the sample mean of a group should be normally distributed around the mean (and scaled by the variance) of the underlying population.

They're called like that because they do not make assumptions of the shape of the underlying distribution and instead compare the ranks of different groups. A non-parametric alternative to the two sample t-test is the [Mann-Whitney U test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test), which tests if one group is stochastically greater than the other. It does so by ranking the data from both groups and calculating how often any obervation from one group is higher in rank than any obervation from the other group. This ranksum is the U statistic, which is approximately normally distributed and, hence, can be assigned a z-score and a corresponding p-value. For assuming this distribution of U under the null, the test does also assume equal variance of the samples' underlying populations. Have a look [here](http://www.statisticslectures.com/topics/mannwhitneyu/) for an example.\n\nLet me show you that the Mann-Whitney U test will yield approximatley the same result as a t-test on ranked normallly distributed data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, mannwhitneyu, rankdata\n\n# make some random data\na = np.random.normal(0.0, 1.0, size=1000)\nb = np.random.normal(0.1, 1.0, size=1000)\n# perform a Mann-Whitney U test, the continuity correction should only be applied for non-continoius data to handle ties\nU, p_mw =  mannwhitneyu(a,b,use_continuity=False,alternative=\"two-sided\")\n\n#rank data\nranked = rankdata(np.append(a,b),method=\"average\")\nranked_a = ranked[:len(a)]\nranked_b = ranked[len(a):]\n# perform a t-test on ranks\nt, p_t = ttest_ind(ranked_a,ranked_b,equal_var=True)\n\nprint(f\"Mann-Whitney U test p-value: {p_mw}\\nt-test p-value: {p_t}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I want to use both the t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test her to compare their results. The p-value will help us in deciding if we want to consider a difference between the groups as statistically significant or not but it does not tell us how large the difference is. Since the answers in the survey don't have a common unit, it makes sense to look at standardized effect sizes. \n\nA standardized difference in means can be expressed by [Cohen's $d$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d), the difference in group means divided by the pooled standard deviation. It assumes equality of variance as well, and can be positively biased for small samples which shouldn't be a problem here. It has a less biased cousin called [Hedge's $g$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Hedges'_g) which is, however, not used as commonly. I will use $d$ here because there are well accepted descriptors for magnitudes: 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 medium, and 0.8 large of an effect. Note that these are just conventional benchmarks and that a different interpretation may make sense in some cases.\n\nAn effect size coming directly out of the Mann-Whitney U test is called the [common language effect size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test#Common_language_effect_size), $f = \\frac{U}{nm}$, where n and m are the sizes of the two groups. It basically tells you, out of all pairs between both groups, the proportion of pairs that support one group being stochastically greater than the other. A value of 0.5 means the groups are stochastically equal and a value of 1.0 means one group is fully greater than the other. This is actually the same metric as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC), which is commonly used to evaluate machine learning models. We can also define a rank biserial correlation as $r = 1 - \\frac{2U}{n m}$. If we'd treat this correlation like a Pearson's correlation, we could transform it into a Cohen's $d$ as $d =  \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{1-r^{2}}}$. Please note that I'm not really confident if that last move can actually be done with a rank biserial correlation and I just want to use it for comparison here - don't quote me on this.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I need to quickly modify Scipy.stats' mannwhitneyu function so that it returns the U statistic for both groups, not just the smaller one\n\nfrom scipy.stats import tiecorrect, distributions\ndef mannwhitneyu(x, y, use_continuity=True, alternative=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    EDIT: My modified version that returns the U statistic for both groups, not just the smaller one\n    \n    Compute the Mann-Whitney rank test on samples x and y.\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x, y : array_like\n        Array of samples, should be one-dimensional.\n    use_continuity : bool, optional\n            Whether a continuity correction (1/2.) should be taken into\n            account.

We saw, for example, that there is no significant difference in the reported happiness of German and Swedish respondents, whereas there is a very large difference in how important Italian and French respondents consider personal success and recognition.\n\nFinally, we employed [machine learning](#ml) methods to predict how happy respondents considers themselves, based on how they answered other questions. We compared the predictions of linear and gradient-boosted decision tree models in terms of their predictive power and interpretability. We then used SHAP values to explain how each feature contributes to an individual prediction for the two models. Good subjective health, high satisfaction with the present state of the economy, and an emotional attachment to the home country tend to contribute positively to the respondents' happiness. On the contrary, worries about not having enough money for household necessities, or being hampered by illness or disability contributes negatively to the respondents' happiness.\n\nThat's it! Thanks a lot for following me through this project and thanks as well to the organizers and participants of this survey and to the developers of the many great open-source tools I used in this project."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python

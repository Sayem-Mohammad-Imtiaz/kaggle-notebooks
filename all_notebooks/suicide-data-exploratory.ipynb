This additionally shows that the country that a person lives in has a similar impact regardless of sex. That is, the ordering of male suicide rates by country is the same as female. This would suggest that there is an approximate scalar proportion between the number of men vs women committing, and therefore that cultural, religious, political, ideological, and other societal factors do not affect men and women _qualitatively_ differently, alternatively, that those effects roughly cancel out in aggregate.\n\n---\n\n### b) by year?\nHave there been different behaviors between the sexes globally over years?\nIf we break this down by countries, it seems likely that some years lows or highs could be related to recorded historical events.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"male = suicides[suicides[\"sex\"] >= \"male\"]\nmale = male.groupby(by=\"year\").mean()\nmale = male.sort_values(by=[\"suicides/100k pop\"], ascending=False)\n\nfemale = suicides[suicides[\"sex\"] <= \"female\"]\nfemale = female.groupby(by=\"year\").mean()\nfemale = female.sort_values(by=[\"suicides/100k pop\"], ascending=False)\n\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(nrows=2, sharey=True, figsize = (30,20))\nsns.barplot(x=male.index, y=male[\"suicides/100k pop\"], ax =ax1)\nsns.barplot(x=female.index, y=female[\"suicides/100k pop\"], ax =ax2)\n\nmx = max(max(male[\"suicides/100k pop\"]), max(female[\"suicides/100k pop\"]))\nax1.set_ylim(0, 1.1*mx)\nax2.set_ylim(0, 1.1*mx)\n\nax1.set_title(\"MALE\")\nax2.set_title(\"FEMALE\")\n\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.5.

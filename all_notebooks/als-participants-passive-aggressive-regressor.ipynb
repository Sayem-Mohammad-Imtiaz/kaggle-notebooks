Approximately, 72.0% reported initial limb weakness onset of disease, followed by bulbar (22.1%), and trunk/global onset (6.1%).\" \n\n\"Other symptoms ever experienced included cramps (56.7%), fasciculations (56.3%), and dysarthria (33.0%). The median time between an increase of muscle cramps until an ALS diagnosis was 12 months; limb onset participants had cramps longer preceding diagnosis versus those with bulbar onset.\"\n\n\"The most frequent interventions used included riluzole (48.3% currently using), wheelchairs/scooters (32.8%), and noninvasive breathing equipment (30.0%). Participants with trunk/global onset were referred to hospice almost four times earlier than others.\"\n\n\"These data show how ALS clinical characteristics differ widely in a large cohort of participants preceding diagnosis and reflect variations in disease onset, progression, and prognosis. Better characterization of symptom onset may assist clinicians in diagnosing ALS sooner, which could lead to earlier therapeutic interventions.\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31131638/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pycaret.classification import *","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/aals_participants.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Median time from ALS diagnosis to symptoms onset among adults with ALS, 19 October 2010–31 December 2015.\n\nCitation: Raymond J, Oskarsson B, Mehta P, Horton K.

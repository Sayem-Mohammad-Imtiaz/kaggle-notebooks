While training the algorithm on the entire dataset (rather then just the test set) will yield a lower error, it does not make for a better algorithm. The point of checking the error on a test set is to see how well the algorithm can predict values it has not seen before. By testing my algorithm on the entire dataset (training + test set), I defeated the purpose of splitting the dataset in the first place. You live and you learn I guess.

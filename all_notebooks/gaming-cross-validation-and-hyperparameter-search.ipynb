In particular, we wonder whether or not we can extrapolate the amount of money a Linux gamer will spend per month based on the amount of hours that said Linux gamer puts into gaming per week.\n\nLooking at the pure distribution from this survey, the correlation between these two things is actually (surprisingly, to me) very low:","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"16a5fd6bacc472fb4dd5a1806f119c26f2b28e37","_cell_guid":"daef904c-eaff-4575-b6af-0de0ec75fb45"},"source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\nsns.jointplot(spend['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'], spend['LinuxGamingSpendingPerMonth'])","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{},"source":"Let's try to use linear regression to get a better handle on how this data is shaped.

The problem is that the more degrees we add to our function, the better it will seem to perform on the whole of the data, as a rule. After all, it's hard to imagine making a model more complex decreasing your predictive strength on the data being trained on!\n\nBut we also clearly have a sense of when there is clearly too much going on. For example, here's what polynomial regression of degree 10 looks like:","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"source":"y_hat = predict(10).predict(PolynomialFeatures(degree=10).fit_transform(hours))\nsortorder = np.argsort(spend['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'].values)\ns = spend['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'].values[sortorder]\ny_hat = y_hat[sortorder]\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(s, y_hat)\nplt.scatter(spend['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'], spend['LinuxGamingSpendingPerMonth'], color='black')","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{},"source":"This is clearly a bogus predictor. The spike at around 60 hours per week is obviously an instance of overfitting: that is, of our model wanting to minimize phantom distances that happen to occur in the data but which have no relationship to reality.\n\nThe problem is that on the face of it, this is a \"better\" model. It's better because for this data it performs better. For example, if we take the Mean Squared Errors, a measure of model fitness, of either model, we fwill ind that the 10-degree one has a smaller mean error than the 1-degree one.\n\nIn this case it's pretty easy for us to solve this issue by generating models of varying numeric compexity and examining them to determine which one has the best fit-simplicity tradeoff. But that's only easy to do because we are using just one variable. If the dataset had many variables to use, then this becomes much harder to do.\n\nIn general, running a model many, many times by hand is tedious. To solve this fit issue, we will use a fundamental tool: cross validation.\n\n## Cross validation\n\nCross validation is simply splitting a dataset into two components: a train dataset, which the model is trained on, and a test dataset, which the model is tested on. For example, a default split between these two parts of the dataset is 80-20. A model will be trained on a random 80% of the dataset; then we will evaluate how well it did using the remaining 20%.\n\nSince that 20% was never seen by the model during training, it is not optimized for, and we can except model performance \"in the wild\" to be closely approximated by model performance on our training data!\n\nThis is cross validation in a nutshell. It's a really simple but critically important idea.\n\nLet's apply this idea to our regression problem.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"n = len(y)\nratio = 0.8\npivot = int(np.round(0.8 * n))\ntrain = spend.iloc[:pivot]\ntest = spend.iloc[pivot:]\n\ntrain_X = train['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'].values[:, np.newaxis]\ntrain_y = train['LinuxGamingSpendingPerMonth'].values[:, np.newaxis]\ntest_X = test['LinuxGamingHoursPerWeek'].values[:, np.newaxis]\ntest_y = test['LinuxGamingSpendingPerMonth'].values[:, np.newaxis]","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"source":"test_y_hat= (LinearRegression()\n     .fit(PolynomialFeatures(degree=10).fit_transform(train_X), train_y)\n     .predict(PolynomialFeatures(degree=10).fit_transform(test_X))\n)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{},"source":"The mean squared error of the degree-10 model is >1300.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n\nmean_squared_error(test_y, test_y_hat)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{},"source":"When we look at what model predicts for the points in our dataset, it becomes obvious why performance is so dismal.

Hence we can use cross validation&mdash;that is, checking the mean squared error of the classifier applied to the test dataset&mdash;for, say, every degree polynomial regression function between 1 and 10. Clearly our best-performing model will be somewhere in there!\n\nThis is known as a hyperparameter search. Hyperparameter searches are important because they are, effectively, how we go about finding the most useful and effective model in a series of possible models controlled by some magic number (the so-named \"hyperparameter\").\n\nIn this case we'll do the search by hand (`scikit-learn` has extensive hyperparameter search facilities that vary model-to-model). For each polynomial regression model between degree 1 and degree 10, we will compute the mean squared error of that model as applied to our cross validation test dataset.

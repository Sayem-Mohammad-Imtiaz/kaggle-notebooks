It was my past experiences as a student, that was the premise which helped me frame analyses rather quickly.\n\nWith Crisis data, I had a quick look, made a few visualizations, and then made some more. At some point, it stopped being \"what insights can I get from this\" and became more about \"Just how many visualizations were possible on the data\". With that in mind, I'll try to keep this notebook simple. There will definitely be insights that I would have overlooked or missed out.\n\nI start off this notebook by mentioning the Source of Data. This data is hosted by the [City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/). The data is maintained in Kaggle by [Socrata](https://socrata.com/)'s API.\n\nI'm still trying to find the best way to acknowledge data, but this one should do for now. I know Kaggle associates each notebook with it's respective dataset, and that they provide acknowledgements, but starting from this notebook, I'll try to acknowledge the data even if there is one by default.\n\nI will also be using Pandas and Seaborn. Since I'm a beginner to Seaborn, there will be parts that might appear inefficient and could be improved significantly."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport datetime\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\nsns.set()\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0c4c638daf673946526aedc9f8a6614ae2a860ba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Loading the Data**\n* I will be importing the data into a DataFrame.

This leads me to believe that work, while not a direct influence, is in someway contributing to their crises\n* Considering initial reports, most reports are either Suicide related or Emotional/Behavioral crisis, with their final call types as General complaints. Does this mean that most were false alarms or worst case scenarios? I'm not sure about that\n* Only 5% of the reports in 2018 requested that a CIT officer be dispatched. This didn't make much of a difference as a CIT officer was dispatched regardless of the request. I like to think of this as a good thing considering that most reports were either Suicide related or individuals in Emotional/Behavioral crisis.\n\n**Final thoughts on this notebook**\n\nTo you, The Reader, Thank you for getting this far. The data might seem all over the place, but I'm pretty happy with where this notebook got me. I consider this as an exercise to look at the bigger picure more, than looking at just one metric. I don't know how Data/Business Analysts tell stories so well on such large data; then again, I didn't know what I was up against, when I started this notebook (mea culpa).\n\nI deviated several times while preparing this notebook. First I thought I'd use the plot method of Pandas, and got lost in finding ways to visualize the data, then I started anew and thought I'd use seaborn and visualize some data. Lost my way again, but this time got caught up on suicide and mental wellness; so much so, that I was on the verge of concluding that a lot of people in Seattle were depressed. Took another step back, and made a mix of seaborn and matplotlibs and looked at crisis data as a whole.\n\nWhile I liked using seaborn, I might not be using just that for all my visualizations. Towards the end, I made use of pivot tables, which I thought was nice. Some of the outputs returned unexpected text results, but I'm pretty sure they will be eliminated once I'm comfortable using variables and not plot off the data itself.\n\nI can't help shake the feeling that I ended the notebook abruptly. There was so much more I had expected (like cross referencing this data with the [WHO Suicide Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/szamil/who-suicide-statistics)) or something similar. I'll try it for another notebook, at a later time.\n\nComments and/or criticisms on the notebook? Any visualizations that I wrongly used or could be used better? Any best practices or general advice on how I can make these better in the future?

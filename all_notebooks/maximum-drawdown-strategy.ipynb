Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. It can be used both as a stand-alone measure or as an input into other metrics such as \"Return over Maximum Drawdown\" and the Calmar Ratio. Maximum Drawdown is expressed in percentage terms.\n\n**Formula**\n\n$MDD = \\frac{Trough Value - Peak Value}{Peak Value}$\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Necessary libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Analysis\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Data Visualisation \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Read in the data ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"monthly_data = pd.read_csv('../input/python/Portfolios_Formed_on_ME_monthly_EW.csv',\n                           header=0, index_col=0, parse_dates=True, na_values=-99.99)\nmonthly_data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's look at the data\nmonthly_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":"## Data Preprocessing\n\nCollect the data for Small Cap and Large Cap Companies named as Low10 and High 10","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract the data\nreturns = monthly_data[['Lo 10', 'Hi 10']]\nreturns.columns = ['SmallCap', 'LargeCap']\nreturns.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert Returns to percentages \nreturns = returns/100\nreturns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Plot the returns to see the trend.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make a line plot of the returns\nreturns.plot.line()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The index is actually messed up and we need to fix this by converting it to time series to get better visualisations.

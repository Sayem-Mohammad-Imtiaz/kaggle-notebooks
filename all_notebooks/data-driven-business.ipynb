The salary is the most sensitive variable to describe it. It specially applies to employees working overtime with low incomes. The income is reflected in different variables such as Education, Job Level, Overtime, Year at company and more. \n\nWe have also found that different variations of work-life balance might represent an issue for our employees. \nThere seems to be a link between attrition and age as well as the number of companies worked for.\nAlso, there seems to be a clear pattern that the people who left travelled more frequently compared to the others. This might have also been a big reason behind them leaving. \n\nIn order to fight attrition, we believe that we should focus on the following variables: \nWe considered Age, Monthly Income, OverTime, Marital Status, JobLevel, YearsAtCompany, Number of Companies worked for, Business Travel.\n \n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

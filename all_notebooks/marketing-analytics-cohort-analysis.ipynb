These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics or experiences within a defined time-span.\n\nCohort analysis is a tool to measure user engagement over time. It helps to know whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or is only appearing to improve because of growth.\n\nCohort analysis proves to be valuable because it helps to separate growth metrics from engagement metrics as growth can easily mask engagement problems. In reality, the lack of activity of the old users is being hidden by the impressive growth numbers of new users, which results in concealing the lack of engagement from a small number of people.\n\n*https://clevertap.com/blog/cohort-analysis/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Cohort analysis is a better way of looking at data.

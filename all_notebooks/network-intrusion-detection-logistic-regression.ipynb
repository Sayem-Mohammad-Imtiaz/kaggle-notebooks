Then I made analyzes using its library.\n\n**Network Intrusion Detection Dataset**\n\nThe dataset to be audited was provided which consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. For this dataset TCP/IP dump data was acquired by simulating a typical US Air Force LAN.For each TCP/IP connection, 41 quantitative and qualitative features are obtained from normal and attack data (3 qualitative and 38 quantitative features).The class variable has two categories:\n* Normal\n* Anomalous\n\nSince we need a binary result for this study, we will classify it according to whether it is normal or not.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we need to import necessary libraries to get dataset which will be used.

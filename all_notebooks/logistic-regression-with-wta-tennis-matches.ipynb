The distribution is non-normal (it can only take on two values after all).\n2. The error terms will be heteroskedastic by definition.\n\nLogistic regression returns a result that's interpretable as an exact probability because it's in the range $(0, 1)$. This form of regression returns a result based on the [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) (hence the name):\n\n$$\\sigma(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-t}}$$\n\nLogistic regression is premised around the squeezing that this function applies to data towards 0 or 1:\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Logistic-curve.svg/320px-Logistic-curve.svg.png)\n\nHere is the full logistic regression expression, expressed in terms of its fundamental unit, the logit:\n\n$$\\ln{\\frac{P}{1-P}} = \\exp{(\\beta_0 + \\beta X + \\varepsilon)}$$\n\nWhere $P$ is the prediction (the probability), $\\beta_0$ is the constant coefficient, $\\beta$ is the vector of non-constant coefficients, and $\\varepsilon$ is the error term. The term on the left is known as the \"logit\", and it does all of the heavy lifting.\n\nNotice that the term inside of the $\\exp{\\cdot}$ term is the linear regression formula! The logistic regression model is simply a non-linear transformation on linear regression. To get the result $P$ (or equivalently $y$), we do this to it:\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\exp{(-\\beta_0 - \\beta X)})}$$\n\nWhat we've achieved here is, via the application of the logistic function to the linear regression result formula, a transformation from a line to logistic curve:\n\n![](http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/service/logit/logit.gif)","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a9102530-ebb5-4e7d-9891-a1aa0815d768","_uuid":"4c44742e4ed263f6bcbf5a400b9b4a60137df603"}},{"source":"## Application\n\nLet's use the `scikit-learn` logistic regression function to predict which of two players will win a match, based on what each player's rank is.","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3144f88d-27e0-4bd5-8782-6e177cd52737","_uuid":"7ba12227fc76e66737d726898e7c661f7b72f8eb","collapsed":true}},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nmatches = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wta_matches_2015.csv\")\nmatches.head()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0710792a-c14e-4346-953b-29db1476a3d3","_uuid":"978351eb5b2b3712e1267758a6b3575acbc24438"}},{"source":"import numpy as np\n\npoint_diff = (matches.winner_rank_points - matches.loser_rank_points).dropna()\nX = point_diff.values[:, np.newaxis]\ny = (point_diff > 0).values.astype(int).reshape(-1, 1)\n\nsort_order = np.argsort(X[:, 0])\nX = X[sort_order, :]\ny = y[sort_order, :]","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a5b7ae93-3168-4262-8962-8411c186b752","_uuid":"0c59eef3920ca40ccc3c76540ae3c030cac20ccd","collapsed":true}},{"source":"from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nclf = LogisticRegression()\nclf.fit(X, y.ravel())\ny_hat = clf.predict(y[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1))\ny_hat = y_hat[sort_order]","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0be69c57-969e-4b50-866e-c32932c10a13","_uuid":"bd287d9d0a83c97e9a196d251c0dcc6740c5d48a","collapsed":true}},{"source":"Here is the raw result in the record, which shows that the player with more ranking points wins somewhat less than two-thirds of the time.","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ed9352d9-f76a-4947-ac45-cf39277089d6","_uuid":"b54fbbd1ff4689666ae421f784ed07cca9fbff04"}},{"source":"pd.Series(y[:, 0]).value_counts()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3db38716-5638-46c9-856a-d294d872cb9a","_uuid":"00eda93c0ac6e005655b554861b858dfc9535c33"}},{"source":"But our classifier classifies every single record as a greater-ranking-points-wins outcome!","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2ec96c8f-3eb1-4035-afc7-b2f39fac2552","_uuid":"4aa03e89c2a4a6ac947d325ec660774ba5b53b48"}},{"source":"pd.Series(y_hat).value_counts()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4d1cd385-26c3-4d63-ad6c-b08e63dbc05b","_uuid":"fc82ca52a64baa2c98b9832f82128997c4561923"}},{"source":"This results in the following propensity for error:","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6cb898a5-bf06-469d-86c9-7b20090c687e","_uuid":"301efc22c8a3cd21fc7b22f51027988786e07187"}},{"source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\npd.Series(y_hat == y[:, 0]).value_counts().plot.bar()","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0dda17d5-1bcc-40a0-8e35-307e6ed493d8","_uuid":"9d2666fa51fcd4a826f573755c2f1fe57fc1eedd"}},{"source":"We can understand this better by looking at `predict_proba`, which returns the probabilities that the result will be a 0 or 1 response, respectively.

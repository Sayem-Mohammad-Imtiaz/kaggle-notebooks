These are people who have been coding for less than 5 years.\nHere are some basic facts about them:\n62% of them live outside the US\ntheir average age is 28 years old\n19% are women\nThey’ve been coding for an average of 21 months\n25% have already landed their first developer job**"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2b34ab4b-5172-0617-cd70-b49aad3ee10e"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7c480e4f-db58-f779-2b84-7448d4d457f8"},"outputs":[],"source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fa30cc09-aa99-1d29-1c39-6edea3557d18"},"outputs":[],"source":"df.columns"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8e7e4027-126e-61ed-3839-298405ef7682"},"outputs":[],"source":"df.head()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7e90118d-cb09-00c9-df64-cb5a8c4b4895"},"outputs":[],"source":"#EDA\n#demographics results \n#Its seems US and India are focusing on learning coding \ndf_1=df[['CountryLive','ID.x']].groupby(['CountryLive']).count()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"899ffc6c-b2f3-70b2-53f5-721b7ef709eb"},"outputs":[],"source":"df_1.sort_values(by='ID.x',ascending=False)[:10].plot(kind='barh')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"38ee493c-5a50-c8f3-0a46-8075ea64eead"},"outputs":[],"source":"df_1.sort_values(by='ID.x',ascending=False)[:10]"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c405e077-00b5-b81e-c79f-7b3d2bd9abdd"},"outputs":[],"source":"#youngster rocking \nvar=df.Age\npd.cut(var,20).value_counts().plot.bar()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f855440c-9c30-93aa-caf1-57fd946e407e"},"outputs":[],"source":"most_common_ages = df.groupby(by='Age').size().sort_values(ascending=False).head(15)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a02e6eeb-3463-61b8-9d6a-ed6659ac4f99"},"outputs":[],"source":"print (most_common_ages)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"db2c1661-6d63-3738-f691-69f0a3853b94"},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

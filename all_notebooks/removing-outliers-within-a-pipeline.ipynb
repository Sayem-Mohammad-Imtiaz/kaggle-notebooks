Including this step in the pipeline ensures that samples with outliers are only removed from the training data, leaving the test data as it is.\n\nThe resulting pipeline can be tested with K-fold Cross Validation, where, for each iteration, the training folds will have its outliers removed while the test/validation fold will be completed used for prediction, giving us a more realistic notion of the model's performance in 'unseen' data.\n    \nTo test this approach, I chose two models, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors, both which are sensitive to outliers. Iâ€™ve compared them with and without the outlier removal function and these were their accuracies on 10-fold CV (with vs without our function):\n- Logistic Regression: 77,12% vs 76,38%\n- K-Nearest Neighbors: 73,60% vs 72,43%\n \nThe motivation for this notebook came from a question I had ([and solved after this answer](https://www.kaggle.com/discussion/230284#1261498)) about how to remove outliers inside K-fold CV to assess their impact on the model. I hope this notebook can be helpful for other beginners like myself. If you have a different approach, feel free to share. If you find useful, please consider upvoting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Libraries\n\nInstead of the sklearn pipeline, we're going to use the imblearn pipeline. The advantage of imblearn is that it allows the use of different samplers to deal with imbalanced data. The imblearn package provides its own set of samplers, but we can also use a custom sampler with imblearn.FunctionSampler.

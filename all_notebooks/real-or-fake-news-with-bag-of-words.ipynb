It is worth pointing out how fast the SVM is able to train and perform inference compaired the other two models\n\nDepending on the model used the difference between count vectorizer and tfidf is either trivial or signifigant. The most interesting of these changes is the naive bayes model, which not only becomes much more accurate, but also cuts a signifigant amount of time off training/inference. One explanation of this is that tfidf essentially has weighted values instead of a strightforward count, which help to start the model off with coeficients (or equivilant model parameters) closer to the optimal value.

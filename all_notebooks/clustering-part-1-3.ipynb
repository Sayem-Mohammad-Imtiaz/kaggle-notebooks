For this reason, the hourly solar power generation time series are released for meteorological conditions of the years 1986-2015 (30 years) without considering any changes in the solar installed capacity. Thus, the installed capacity considered is fixed as the one installed at the end of 2015. For this reason, data from EMHIRES should not be compared with actual power generation data other than referring to the reference year 2015.\n\n__Content__\n- The data is available at both the national level and the [NUTS 2 level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomenclature_of_Territorial_Units_for_Statistics). The NUTS 2 system divides the EU into 276 statistical units.\n- Please see the manual for the technical details of how these estimates were generated.\n- This product is intended for policy analysis over a wide area and is not the best for estimating the output from a single system.

In k-means clustering, we specify the number of desired clusters k, and the algorithm will assign each observation to exactly one of these k clusters. The algorithm optimizes the groups by minimizing the within-cluster variation (also known as inertia) such that the sum of the within-cluster variations across all k clusters is as small as possible. \n\nDifferent runs of k-means will result in slightly different cluster assignments because k-means randomly assigns each observation to one of the k clusters to kick off the clustering process. k-means does this random initialization to speed up the clustering process. After this random initialization, k-means reassigns the observations to different clusters as it attempts to minimize the Euclidean distance between each observation and its cluster’s center point, or centroid. This random initialization is a source of randomness, resulting in slightly different clustering assignments, from one k-means run to another. \n\nTypically, the k-means algorithm does several runs and chooses the run that has the best separation, defined as the lowest total sum of within-cluster variations across all k clusters. \n\nReference : [Hands-On Unsupervised Learning Using Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-unsupervised-learning/9781492035633/)\n\n## Evaluating the cluster quality\n\nThe goal here isn’t just to make clusters, but to make good, meaningful clusters. Quality clustering is when the datapoints within a cluster are close together, and afar from other clusters.\nThe two methods to measure the cluster quality are described below:\n- Inertia: Intuitively, inertia tells how far away the points within a cluster are. Therefore, a small of inertia is aimed for. The range of inertia’s value starts from zero and goes up.\n- Silhouette score: Silhouette score tells how far away the datapoints in one cluster are, from the datapoints in another cluster. The range of silhouette score is from -1 to 1. Score should be closer to 1 than -1.\n\nReference : [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-from-a-to-z-f6242a314e9a)\n\n__Optimal K: the elbow method__\n\nHow many clusters would you choose ?\n\nA common, empirical method, is the elbow method. You plot the mean distance of every point toward its cluster center, as a function of the number of clusters.

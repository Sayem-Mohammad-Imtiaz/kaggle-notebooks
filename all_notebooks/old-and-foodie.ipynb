However,the chance of an older person to have eaten more variety of food is more than that of a younger person.A person of age range 40-50 is expected to have tasted more variety of food than a child of age group 10-20.It is because a person of age 40 had more oppurtunities to try a new variety of food than a person who is 20 years old now.We are going to prove this theory based on this data. \n\nFirst,let's have a look at the data.

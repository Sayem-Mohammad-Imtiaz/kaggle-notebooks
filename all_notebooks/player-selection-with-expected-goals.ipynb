After a deceiving 2016/2017 season finished below the middle of the table and the retirement of the club's lifelong striker, the team needs more than ever a new forward in order to grab one of the few European tickets.\n\nOur club usually plays in a 4-4-1-1 defensive formation, quite popular in the league. This new striker will be surounded by a good offensive mildfielder with nice passing ability and two wingers on their favorite foot that enjoy throwing crosses. \n\nBased on this statement, the coach gave you the following requirements :\n\n- **poacher** --> this striker doesn't have to be a playmaker as he will have quality teammates around him to do the job, but must be super effective in front of the target \n- **aerial threat** --> our guy needs to be solid in the air to compete with the physical PL defenders and take benefits from our wingers' crossing quality\n- **counterattacker** --> the perfect candidate for the role should be performing well in counter-attack, as most of the chances he will get will come from this type of plays\n- **clear headed** --> due to the playstyle of our team, based on counter-attacks, our number of chances will be scarced, so we need someone who will not waste opportunities with shots that have no chance of going in\n- **experienced** --> this forward needs to have at least 5 years of experience at the highest level, in one of the Top 5 European Leagues","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#hide the warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/football-events/events.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data exploration","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset we have is perfect for our mission.

We can pretend that Messi has good teammates that do all the job for him and allow him to only score taps-in, while Ronaldo has to take harder shots, and thus has a lower ratio of goals/shot.\n\nThat's why we need another way of evaluating the performances of a striker : the **Expected Goals** (xG) are the perfect indicator for that.\n\nThe objective of the xG is to give a value to each shot, between 0 and 1.

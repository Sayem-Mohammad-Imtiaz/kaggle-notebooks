You can find the first day's challenge [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/regression-challenge-day-1). Today, we’re going to learn how to fit a model to data and how to make sure we haven’t violated any of the underlying assumptions. First, though, you need a tiny bit of background:\n____\n\n**Regression formulas in R**\n\nIn R, regression is expressed using a specific type of object called a formula. This means that the syntax for expressing a regression relationship is the same across packages that use formula objects. The general syntax for a formula looks like this:\n\n    Output ~ input\n\nIf you think that more than one input might be affecting your output (for example that both the amount of time spent exercising and the number of calories consumed might affect changes in someone’s weight) you can represent that with this notation:\n\n\tOutput ~ input1 + input2\n    \nWe'll talk about how to know which inputs you should include later on: for now, let's just stick to picking inputs based on questions that are interesting to you. (Figuring out how to turn a quesiton into a \n\n**What are these “residuals” everyone keeps talking about?**\n\nA residual is just how far off a model is for a single point. So if our model predicts that a 20 pound cantaloupe should sell for eight dollars and it actually sells for ten dollars, the residual for that data point would be two dollars. Most models will be off by at least a little bit for pretty much all points, but you want to make sure that there’s not a strong pattern in your residuals because that suggests that your model is failing to capture some underlying trend in your dataset.\n____\n\nToday, we're going to practice fitting a regression model to our data and examining the residuals to see if our model is a good representation of our data.\n\n___\n\n<center>\n[**You can check out a video that goes with this notebook by clicking here.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C8SxyD8C7I)\n","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"72649db2fc382d9639f94da23c687b61726cf04b","_cell_guid":"58cd1596-f45b-4fb6-99cc-dd7b7152da74"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example: Kaggle data science survey\n___\n\nFor our example today, we're going to use the Kaggle we’re going to use the 2017 Kaggle ML and Data Science Survey.

Spoiler alert: all of these plots are showing us big warning signs for this model! Here's what they should look like:\n\n* **Residuals vs Linear predictor**: You want this to look like a shapeless cloud. If there are outliers it means you've gotten some things very wrong, and if there's a clear pattern it usually means you've picked the wrong type of model.\n* **Quantiles of standard normal vs. ordered deviance residuals**: For this plot you want to see the risiduals lined up along the a diagonal line that goes from the bottom left to top right. If they're strongly off that line, especially in one corner, it means you have a strong skew in your data.\n* **Cook's distance vs. h/(1-h)**: Here, you want your data points to be clustered near zero. If you have a data point that is far from zero (on either axis) it means that it's very influential and that one point is dramatically changing your analysis.\n* **Cook's distance vs. cas**e: In this plot, you want your data to be mostly around zero on the y axis. The x axis just tells you what row in your dataframe the observation is taken from. Points that are outliers on the y axis are changing your model a lot and should probably be removed (unless you have a good reason to include them).\n\nBased on these diagnostic plots, we should definitely not trust this model. There are a small handful of very influential points that are drastically changing our model. Remember, we didn't convert all the currencies to the same currency, so we're probably seeing some weirdnesses due to including a currency like the Yen, which is worth roughly one one-hundredth of a dollar. \n\nWith that in mind, let's see how the plots change when we remove any salaries above 200,000.

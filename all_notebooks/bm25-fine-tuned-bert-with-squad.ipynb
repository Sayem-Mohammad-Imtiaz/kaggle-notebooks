To do so, for a given query, we rank each document using BM25+ scoring. \n\n**BM25+** is the next generation of TFIDF (term frequency–inverse document frequency) and stands for “Best Match 25 +”. It is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query. The score increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. BM25+ is the version of BM25 adapted for a long documents.\n\n**Example**\n\n*Document A: \"The man went out for a walk\"*\n\n*Document B: \"The children sat around the fire\"*\n\nFirst we create a dictionary of words and their occurence for each document in the corpus (collection of documents):\n\n![freq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/84591334-c3d55e80-ae3d-11ea-9b59-addde9b0fc76.png)\n\nin which row 0 stands for the document A and row 1 - for the document B.\n\n**Term Frequency (TF)** is defined as *the number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document.* Every document has its own term frequency.\n\n**Inverse Data Frequency (IDF)** id defined as *the log of the number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the word w.* Inverse data frequency determines the weight of rare words across all documents in the corpus.\n\nLastly, the **TF-IDF** score is simply *the TF multiplied by IDF*.\n\n![fff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/84591503-3dba1780-ae3f-11ea-8e30-d0f365a4a30a.png)\n\nAs one can see, TF-IDF score for the word \"fire\" much higher for the document B (row 1), than for the document A (row 0) when \"walk\" is more significant for the document A. \nThus, if the query would be **\"Who is sitting around the fire?\"**, our document retrieval will select the document B as the most related document to the query.\n\nWe need to clarify, that certain words are used to formulate sentences but do not add any semantic meaning to the text. For example, the most commonly used word in the english language is **the** which represents 7% of all words written or spoken. You couldn’t make deduce anything about a text given the fact that it contains the word **the**. On the other hand, words like **fatality** and **death** could be used to determine a death rate for example. In natural language processing, useless words are referred to as stop words, for this reason we filter all stop words.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2> <span style=\"color:green\"> Information Extraction </span> </h2>\n\n> The aim of the information extraction is to find an answer for a given question in a given article. First we need to exptract the paragraph(s) that contain(s) the answer and then find the answer in a given paragraph.\n\nWe use a new baseline for the SQuAD based on BERT. \n\n**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a recent model introduced by researchers at Google AI Language. BERT makes use of Transformer, an attention mechanism that learns contextual relations between words in a text. In its vanilla form, Transformer includes two separate mechanisms — an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that produces a prediction for the task.\n\nThe chart below is a high-level description of the Transformer encoder. The input is a sequence of tokens, which are first embedded into vectors and then processed in the neural network. The output is a sequence of vectors of size H, in which each vector corresponds to an input token with the same index.\n\nBefore feeding word sequences into BERT, 15% of the words in each sequence are replaced with a [MASK] token. The model then attempts to predict the original value of the masked words, based on the context provided by the other, non-masked, words in the sequence.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/84592125-87a4fc80-ae43-11ea-9d18-09678cd9e43f.png\" width=\"450\" align=\"center\"/>\n\nGenerally speaking during training BERT learns to understand a language and the relation between words. Then BERT has to be fine-tuned for a specific task: *the model receives a question regarding a text sequence and is required to mark the answer in the paragraph*.\n\nFor this reason we use **SQuAD 2.2 dataset** (Stanford Question and Answers Dataset) is a question answering dataset containing  100,000+ questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a segment of text from the corresponding reading passage.\n\nThe model tokenize every example in QA, then generate multiple instances per example by concatenating a “[CLS]” token, the tokenized question, a “[SEP]” token, tokens from the content of the document, and a final “[SEP]” token, limiting the total size of each instance to 512 tokens. For each document we generate all possible instances, by listing the document content. For each training instance start and end token indices are computed  to represent the target answer span.\n\nThe chart below is a high-level description of the fine-tuning BERT:\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/84592410-d5baff80-ae45-11ea-970e-f93d3ac717a8.png\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n**Example continuation**\n\nAfter document selection we stay with the Document B:\n\n*Document B: \"The children sat around the fire\"*\n\nAnd now the idea is to extract the answer for the following question:\n\n*Query: \"Who is sitting around the fire?\"*\n\nThen the model output will be\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28005338/84592625-6c3bf080-ae47-11ea-9cd3-5820fdede06f.png\" align=\"center\"/>\n\nSince we are working with the long documents, the model will first select only those paragraphs that contain the answer and for each paragraph will perform the extraction.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2> <span style=\"color:green\"> Difference with other approaches </span> </h2> \n\nWe have seen that most approaches rely entirely on embedding techniques to find the answer or on document retrieval techniques to find the most relevant documents.

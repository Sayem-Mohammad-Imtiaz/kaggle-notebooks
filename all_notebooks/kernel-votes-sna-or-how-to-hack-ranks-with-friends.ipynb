Just kidding.  But honestly, this is an interesting \"feature\". A group of 20 people could make each other Masters in Kernels in ~10 minutes. And such trend could easily turn Kaggle into Youtube / Instagram by \"vote me and I vote you in response\" comments.\n\nLet's explore the voting data to find out if there were such precedents. To do this we need to find clusters or communities of people with high vote rate for each other. We will build a social graph with nodes corresponding to users and edges corresponding to votes. Then we will search for \"k-cores\" - clusters of fully-connected subgraphs with k nodes. Will we discover \"kernel friends\"?

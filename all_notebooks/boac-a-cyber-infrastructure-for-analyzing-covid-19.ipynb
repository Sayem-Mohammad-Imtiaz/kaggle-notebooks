Some examples of such questions include but are not limited to:\n\n* What antiviral drugs have been tested against coronaviruses?\n* What drugs are effective and what are ineffective?\n* There are many types of vaccines (inactivated vaccines, modified live virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, genetically engineered vaccines, etc.). What types of vaccines have been developed and evaluated against different coronaviruses?\n* What has been the conclusion on the effectiveness of the vaccine candidates?\n* What are the origins of coronaviruses? How have the coronaviruses been transmitted (cross-species or not)?\n\n### Who is behind BoaC?\n\nThe BoaC project is led by [Hridesh Rajan](https://http//web.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/) at Iowa State University and [Robert Dyer](https://www.cs.bgsu.edu/rdyer/) at Bowling Green State University. The project also involves PhD students [Yijia Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yijiahuang) and [Rangeet Pan](https://rangeetpanisu.web.app/). We have also significantly benefited from our collaborators [Simon Geletta](https://www.dmu.edu/directory/simon-geletta/), a professor of public health, [Jianqiang Zhang](https://vetmed.iastate.edu/users/jqzhang), and [Tomislav Jelesijević](https://vetmed.iastate.edu/users/tomislav) both faculty in veterinary medicine and experts in virology and coronaviruses.\n\n### What are some key current capabilities?\n\nThe BoaC cyberinfrastructure already provides the following capabilities and we are adding more capabilities as we speak.\n\n**Basic search capabilities**. BoaC's search capabilities include:\n\n* The ability to search through the articles.\n* Limit your search to exact phrase.\n* Exclude certain words from your search.\n* Limit your search to title, abstract, body, or findings of the articles.\n* Limit your search by publication date of the articles.\n\n**Advanced text analysis.** The BoaC infrastructure also provides the capability to search through every part of the paper including the body of the paper and references. This data is stored in a structured form and your analytics can browse over that structure. This includes the ability to:\n\n* Analyze each part of the paper including title, abstract, all sections, references.\n* Analyze metadata including authors, affiliation, etc. and make search decisions based on that.\n* Analyze references and do cross-linking between various sections of a paper.\n* Analyze cited references, and accumulate papers citing certain papers.\n* Remove stop words during analysis to focus on important contents.\n* Much more coming soon...\n\n**[Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/ea_eWXJrbM8)**\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n\nWe have evaluated several risks mentioned in the task and ran our query to find insights from the research papers.\nWe answer several question in regards to the task and the details of the question and the findings are mentioned below.\n\n**Q1: **What do we know about transmission dynamics of the virus, including the basic reproductive number, incubation period, serial interval, modes of transmission and environmental factors?\n\n**A1: ** Query result can be found at http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/boac/?q=boa/result/public/398.\nBelow we have shown some of the examples of our result and how it can help to answer the question.

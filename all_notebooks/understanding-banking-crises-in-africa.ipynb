The output layer contains a single neuron in order to make predictions. It uses the sigmoid activation function in order to produce a probability output in the range of 0 to 1 that can easily and automatically be converted to crisp class values.\n\nFinally, we are using the logarithmic loss function (binary_crossentropy) during training, the preferred loss function for binary classification problems.

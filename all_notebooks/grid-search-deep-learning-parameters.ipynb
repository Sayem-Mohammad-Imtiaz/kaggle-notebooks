In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that makes this problem more challenging.\n***\n\n<b>Domain: Finance</b>\n\nAnalysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model. \n\nContent: \n\nDataset columns and definition:\n\n- credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.\n\n- purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values \"credit_card\", \"debt_consolidation\", \"educational\", \"major_purchase\", \"small_business\", and \"all_other\").\n\n- int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by   LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n\n- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.\n\n- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.\n\n- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).\n\n- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.\n\n- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.\n\n- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).\n\n- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).\n\n- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n\n- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n\n- pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Approach \n-  Exploratory Data Analysis\n-  Statistical Hypothesis Tests on

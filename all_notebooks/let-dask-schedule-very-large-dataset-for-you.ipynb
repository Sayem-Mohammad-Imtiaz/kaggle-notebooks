To enable massive \"big data\" processing, one could execute data ingestion functions such as `read_csv`, where the data is held on storage accessible to every worker node (e.g., amazon's S3), and because most operations begin by selecting only some columns, transforming and filtering the data, only relatively small amounts of data need to be communicated between the machines.\n\nDask.dataframe operations use `pandas` operations internally.  Generally they run at about the same speed.\n\nDask.dataframe only covers a small but well-used portion of the Pandas API.\nThis limitation is for two reasons:\n\n1.  The Pandas API is *huge*\n2.  Some operations are genuinely hard to do in parallel (e.g. sort)\n\nAdditionally, some important operations like ``set_index`` work, but are slower\nthan in Pandas because they include substantial shuffling of data, and may write out to disk.","metadata":{}}]}

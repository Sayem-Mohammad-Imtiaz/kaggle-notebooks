Another common way of preprocessing numerical input is **standardisation**, which subtracts the mean from each datum and divides it by the standard deviation. **Min-max normalisation** puts the input in a confined range, i.e. from 0 to 1, whereas **standardisation** would result in variables that range from negative to positive.\n* For our preprocessing purposes, we are going to use the min and max of the **training** dataset.

This can reveal how rich they are.\n* Policy sales channels can play a role (e.g. agent channels are more effective due to interpersonal relationship).

The [World Bank](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/) has done a great job in collecting all sorts of indicators that could point in the direction of financial inclusion or exclusion. \nIn my previous notebook I summarised \"financial inclusion\" as the average of the three dimensions that capture the essence of financial inclusion across the population that has an income that is lower than the countries mean income:\n- Account at a financial institution\n- Borrowed from a financial institution\n- Able to come up with emergency funds\n\nAnother way to measure financial inclusion is to compare financial inclusion of the poorest population against financial inclusion for the richest population within a country. That is what we are going to do in this analysis. This gap is important to know, because it shows us the dispersion between the richest and poorest population. \n\nIn this notebook I frame financial inclusion in terms of the ratio of the population that has the opportunity to borrow from a formal financial institution versus that borrows from an informal lender, while I'm also particularly interested in the gap that exists between the richest population and the poorest population.  \n\nI frame formal and informal borrowing as the ratio that an individual has borrowed from a financial institution, respectively borrowed from a private informal lender respectively, versus whether he/she has borrowed any money in the past year. \n\nNext, I will compute a measurement for financial exlusion as a I described above as the following:\n\nWhere:\n- RF = Formal borrowing for the richest population\n- RI = Informal borrowing for the richest population\n- PF = Formal borrowing for the poorest population\n- PI = Informal borrowing for the poorest population\n\n$$\n\\frac{(RF-RI)-(PF-PI)}{RF-RI}\n$$\n\nLet's build this variable."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom numpy import log10, ceil, ones\nfrom numpy.linalg import inv \n%matplotlib inline\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":169,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f689b35feee71e8109a242d95abaafe27e957f4e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Extract the variables from the dataset."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4e5120c47fda604dfe2335b4b85ec740d92d15f6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Fcol = ['Country Code', 'Indicator Name', 'MRV']\nF = pd.read_csv(\"../input/findex-world-bank/FINDEXData.csv\", usecols=Fcol)","execution_count":170,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"52dfb314a0dd1caf9d2bd499b83dca4463330c2e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"F.head()","execution_count":171,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"31b5a6a865cec37262089a7f6dc8a87b99436cf7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"indicators_search = 'Borrowed any money in the past year|\\\nBorrowed for education or school fees|\\\nBorrowed for health or medical purposes|\\\nBorrowed from a financial institution|\\\nBorrowed from a private informal lender|\\\nBorrowed from family or friends|\\\nBorrowed to start, operate, or expand a farm or business|\\\nComing up with emergency funds: not at all possible|\\\nComing up with emergency funds: not very possible|\\\nComing up with emergency funds: somewhat possible|\\\nComing up with emergency funds: very possible|\\\nAccount at a financial institution|\\\nSaved at a financial institution|\\\nMain source of emergency funds: family or friends|\\\nMain source of emergency funds: savings'\n# Loan in the past year\n\ngroup_search_income = 'richest|poorest'\n\ndef clean(findex, indicators_search, group_search=group_search_income):\n    \"\"\"Split Indicator Name into two columns: Indicator and Group.\"\"\"\n\n    #

Due to the higher rate of borrowing from informal lenders the value for financial exclusion is negative. Based on this value for Afghanisation we could conclude that both the richest and the poorest people are financially excluded.  \n\nIn **Angola** however, the majority of the richest people borrow from formal financial insitutions, while the poorest people borrow more from private informal lenders. The high value for financial exclusion indicates that there is a large difference between the richest and the poorest population in terms of opportunities for the poor to borrow from formal financial insitutions. \n\nIn **Albania** borrowing from formal financial institutions is more popular among both the richest and the poorest. However, there is a large difference between the two income groups and borrowing from a formal financial insitution is still very limited among the poor. The dispersion is closer to zero compared to Angola, but there is still a remarkable difference between the two income groups. \n\nIn the **United Arab Emirates** there is even more equality among the poor and the rich.

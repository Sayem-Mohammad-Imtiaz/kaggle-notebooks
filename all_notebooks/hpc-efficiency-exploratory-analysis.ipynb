Some predictives actions are taken (such as on-wing engine washing), but maintenance mostly relies on visual inspection and expert's knowledge.\n\n**But why don't they just meassure efficiency?**\nThat would be a fair question, sadly that is not possible, it is not even possible to meassure real thrust (at least not easily). Furhtermore, not all of the variables present on this dataset are usually meassure, only some of them.\n\nUsually, during a plane overhaul or engine maintenance these variables are meassured:\n**Shaft speeds, Fuel Flow, Exit-LPT temperature, Exit-LPT pressure**\n\nSo, let's look at these features closely..","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from seaborn import pairplot\npairplot(df, vars = ['HPSpoolSpeed_RPM', 'LPSpoolSpeed_RPM' , 'FuelFlow_kg/s', 'LPTExitPressureP5_kPA', 'LPTExitTemperatureT5_K', 'Isentr.HPCEfficiency'])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# *Everything is related..*\n**Let's have a look at the last row of the Pairplot above..**\nWhy are these variables correlated like so? Well, even though the engine is an agglomeration of different machines (compressors, turbines, nozzles, etc) everything works together as a hole and components affect each other's opperation.\n\nIn this case we are seeing that as HPC efficiency drops, the entire system must compensate for these losses in orther to keep the HPC rotation speed constant. The low pressure compressor rotates faster, increasing the pressure of the air exiting the LPC and entering the HPC. More fuel is burned as the efficiency drops as a way to compensate for the energy loss and this translates into higher temperatures and pressure at the exit of the low pressure turbine.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# A big fat *\nDisclaimer: im not an expert, on anything.. so let me know should you notice some error, or if you find better ways to explain the technical details. I will really appretiate that!\n\n**On another subject:**\nYou may wanna try fitting several regression models to predict HPC efficiency. This is a really easy and simplified example. In reality, all engine components affect each other, all suffer from some level of deterioration, affecting the behaviour of the system. One component may show a decreasse in its performance without being deteriorated, because of the change of working conditions introduced by other deteriorated part of the engine.","metadata":{}}]}

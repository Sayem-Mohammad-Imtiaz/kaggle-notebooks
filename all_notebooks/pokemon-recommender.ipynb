this dataset, I thought it would be great to build a pokemon recommender system since I like Pokemon\n\nThis dataset contains pokemons from first six generations and their stats, \nI'll be using stats and type of pokemon to know similarities between pokemon, \nI have labelled each pokemon with Normal/Mega/Legendary tag and included them while calculating similarity, it is kind of like adding more weight to the similarity score of pokemons with similar tag\n\nBelow I am importing required libraries\n\n* numpy, pandas basic libraries\n* seaborn and matplotlib for plotting\n* cosine_similarity heart of this model, to find the similarities between pokemons\n* warnings to ignore warnings\n* standard scaler to bring down the stats of the pokemon to same scale\n* ipywidgets for intracting with

Databases to be used:** \n* FIFA 19 player dataset\n* FIFA 20 player dataset\n* 2018-2019 match results from top European Leagues (~3000 matches)\n\n**2. Models to be developed:** \n* A predictor model will be developed using 2018-2019 match results and player dataset (actually we will be constructing team dataset using player attributes)\n* After the model is complete it will be used to predict Champions League match outcomes using FIFA 20 player dataset\n* My approach will be on categorisation of match outcomes (Home, Away, Draw) thus I will test KNN (yet I will not test other algorithms for this particular project)\n\n**3. Expected results:** \n* At the end of this study, we will have group standings predictions for each group in UEFA Champions League 2019/2020 season\n\n\nLet's begin to see if your favorite team will be able to make the second round this year!

We used each player's attributes to decide on overall ratings\n* I used 2018-2019 football results from major leagues around the world and FIFA 19 dataset to train the model (around 3000 matches) \n* I created fixtures for the teams in CL and merged this table with FIFA 20 dataset so each team's attributes are calculated\n* Then I used k-NN algorithm to build the model and predict the outcome\n\n***What was the outcome of the model?***\n\n* The model provided 54% accuracy which is near to levels achieved by some academic studies as well (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/computing/public/1718-ug-projects/Corentin-Herbinet-Using-Machine-Learning-techniques-to-predict-the-outcome-of-profressional-football-matches.pdf)\n\n***What could be further steps and development areas?***\n\n* Developing a different ML model: A linear regression model to determine how much goals would be scored by each team in each game or a decision tree model could be applied to see the outcomes and the accuracy\n* Data manipulation: More data regarding the form of each team, starting elevens, injuries, condition etc. could be added to the initial data for (hopefully) better accuracy. The model then could be runned just before each game to have a more accurate outcome\n\nPlease let me know in the comments if your team will make it to the next round or regarding the models itself!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

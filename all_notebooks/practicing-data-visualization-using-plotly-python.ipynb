What is plotly?\n\n* Plotly is a canadian company that builds a suite of data analytics and visualization tools with an emphasis on **online collaboration** on your graphs and charts.\n* The suite of products offered by plotly can be broadly divided into 3 categories. **BI software**, **Data Science & open source** and **Platforms**.\n* I am going to practice only **plotly.py** which is a Python API for plotly software.\n* Under the hood, plotly uses a rich D3.js framework. Every plotly graph is serialized to a JSON object.\n* plotly.py interacts with plotly.js behind the scenes to produce visualization\n\n### Important modules in plotly Python API\n\nWe mostly interact with 2 modules\n\n1. plotly.plotly module\n    * Allows us to communicate with the plotly servers in the plotly cloud platform which makes online collaboration on your graphs possible.\n\n2. plotly.graph_objs\n    * graph objects module contains all the functionality we need to build complex and interesting visualizations\n    \n###  Plotly Visualization Components\n    \n1. DATA\n    * This is a python list containing **traces**. \n    * A **trace** is an individual element of the figure\n    * Ex: imagine a line chart with 2 different lines plotted on the same plot. Each of the line would be a trace.\n    * A data can comprise of any number of traces.\n\n2. LAYOUT\n    * Defines the look and feel of a plot.\n    * Take care of Title, X-axis, Y-axis, Legend and Shapes\n\n3. FIGURE\n    * The data and layout objects are then pulled together in a FIGURE object.\n    * This is the final object which is plotted on screen\n    * Dictionary like specification that contains DATA and FIGURE objects."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.offline as offline\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\n\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\noffline.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"eff882158c5bda7126025d952fc9fea186652596"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

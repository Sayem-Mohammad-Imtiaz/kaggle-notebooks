This set of information also has various other factors which may or may not correlate with the total happiness score of each country. The second data set contains data on the perceived level of corruption for every country in the world. With this the following questions can be asked:\n\n 1. Is there a correlation between the Happiness Score and the Corruption level of a country?\n 2. Is there a correlation between the Happiness Score and the Global Country Risk Rating of a country?\n 3. Can a Regression Line or Prediction be made from the two correlations above?"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cbdc07b8-52ae-d50e-349d-54ed7dc6049d"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nfrom sklearn import datasets, linear_model\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"08b4fa89-9118-9833-bc4a-8cc92c9212b0"},"outputs":[],"source":"data_set16 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/world-happiness/2016.csv\")\ndata_setCI = pd.read_csv(\"../input/corruption-index/history.csv\")\ndata_setRR = pd.read_csv(\"../input/corruption-index/index.csv\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cabc4694-bdf3-4730-9f3c-406560ec62fe"},"outputs":[],"source":"country_setHP = data_set16.loc[data_set16['Country'].isin(data_setCI['Country'])]\ncountry_setCP = data_setCI.loc[data_setCI['Country'].isin(country_setHP['Country'])]\ncountry_setRR = data_setRR.loc[data_setRR['Country'].isin(country_setHP['Country'])]"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5e102fee-510d-fc98-e80b-3534c09be0c4"},"outputs":[],"source":"country_setHP"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"10a2cb65-623c-6601-c47d-83101ccc34c9"},"outputs":[],"source":"country_setCP"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"00673bb7-cddd-6326-21b3-e80fa89a06c0"},"outputs":[],"source":"country_setCP"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"47034e88-b8f4-74f6-3b9b-d80b84cae2be"},"outputs":[],"source":"country_setHP = country_setHP.sort_values('Country')\ncountry_setCP = country_setCP.sort_values('Country')\ncountry_setRR = country_setRR.sort_values('Country')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e194ed6-f61a-633c-fb45-2506557c7d43"},"source":"## Happiness and Corruption Index ##"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"72d1eb76-0234-17b5-f65c-0c73376abe37"},"outputs":[],"source":"x = country_setHP['Happiness Score'].values.reshape(146, 1)\ny = country_setCP['CPI 2016 Score'].values.reshape(146, 1)\n\nregr = linear_model.LinearRegression()\nregr.fit(x, y)\n\nplt.scatter(country_setHP['Happiness Score'], country_setCP['CPI 2016 Score'])\nplt.plot(x, regr.predict(x), color = 'red')\nplt.xlabel('Happiness Score')\nplt.ylabel('Corruption Perception Index')\nplt.title('Correlation between Happiness Score and CPI in 2016')\n\nprint('Pearson\\'s R:')\ncountry_setHP['Happiness Score'].corr(country_setCP['CPI 2016 Score'])"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"91d18687-2f33-cbaf-3461-792edafcb1c8"},"source":"## Findings ##\nFrom the graph showed above, we can see that the values for Happiness Score and Corruption Index for each country is very scattered but they do somewhat retain a diagonal line upwards that looks like the predicted regression line.

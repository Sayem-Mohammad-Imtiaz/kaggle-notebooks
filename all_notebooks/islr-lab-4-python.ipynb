While the formulas for the standard errors of the coefficients don't rely on the correctness of the model, our estimate for $\\sigma^2$ does. We saw previously that there is a non-linear relationship `mpg` and `horsepower`, which results in inflated residuals from a linear fit. In turn, this will affect our estimate of $\\sigma^2$.\n- In addition, the standard formulas make the (somewhat unrealistic) assumption that the $x_i$ are fixed, and that all of the variability comes from the variation in the errors $\\epsilon_i$.\n\nThe bootstrap approach doesn't rely on any of these assumptions, so it is likely that the bootstrap estimates are more accurate estimates of the standard errors of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ than those from the `summary()` or `bse()` functions in StatsModels.\n\nTo conclude, we use the bootstrap to compute standard error estimates for a quadratic model and compare them with the standard linear regression estimates. Since a quadratic model provides a good fit to the data, there is now a better correpondence between the bootstrap estimates and the standard estimates of $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)$ for $i = 0, 1, 2$."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.random.seed(17)\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree = 2, include_bias = False)\nreg = LinearRegression()\nbootstrap_estimates = pd.DataFrame()\nfor i in range(1000):\n    sample = resample(Auto)\n    X = poly.fit_transform(sample[\"horsepower\"].values.reshape(-1, 1))\n    y = sample[\"mpg\"]\n    coefs = pd.Series(fit_coefs(X, y, reg), index = [\"horsepower\", \"horsepower^2\", \"intercept\"], name = i)\n    bootstrap_estimates = bootstrap_estimates.join(coefs, how = \"right\")\npd.DataFrame({\"original\": bootstrap_estimates.mean(axis = 1), \"std. error\": bootstrap_estimates.std(axis = 1)})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree = 2)\nexog = poly.fit_transform(Auto[\"horsepower\"].values.reshape(-1, 1))\nendog = Auto[\"mpg\"]\nmod = sm.OLS(endog, exog)\nres = mod.fit()\nprint(res.summary())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"res.bse","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

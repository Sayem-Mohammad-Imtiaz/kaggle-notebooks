This shows that our labour force is getting much more advanced educated. But does our economy have that space to contain this massive army of educated labour? We can clearly see that only service sector is filling that gap, but this will create a vast *educated unemployment* in future (which doesn't show up in general unemployment data) as most of the service employment does not require highly advanced educational qualification. \n\nWe can also observe that since 2010, the population in industrial sector is decreasing which is due to high educated but low skilled labour population, not suitable for Industry.\n\nWe also see the sharp decrease in agricultural sector since 2005. Is it due to bad governance of our agricultural sector or agricultural sectors are getting more automated and less manual?\n\nWe also see a sudden increase in service sector since 2010. Is it due to the booming effect of the internet and cellular phones?

Is this sustainable?\n\nFrom Inflation, we can not conclude anything accurately, but its sure that our government has failed to control inflation as there are steep highs and lows.\n\nThe sad news is, even after such a reasonable increase in GDP our government is not expending that much on education. Also though there was a good sign after 2010, that too has started declining. That's a bad sign for us as a society.

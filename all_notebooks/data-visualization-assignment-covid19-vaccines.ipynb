The reason for this could be that because China's population is so high, it simply cannot afford too provide everyone they vaccinate with two vaccines, but if we look at India, the second most populated country in the world, they are second in complete vaccinations, so it could be that either India has more vaccines availabe, or that the Chinese goverment does not feel the need to give each person two dozes of the vaccine."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# daily Vaccination progress of major countries\ndata2 = data.pivot_table(index = \"date\", columns = \"country\", values = \"daily_vaccinations\")\ndata2[[\"United States\", \"China\", \"India\", \"United Kingdom\"]].replace(0, np.nan).fillna(method = \"bfill\", axis = 0).plot(xlabel= \"Date\", ylabel = \"No of people vaccinated daily(in millions)\", title = \"Progress of daily vaccinations in major countries\", figsize = (10,7))\nplt.legend(loc = \"upper right\", bbox_to_anchor = (1.4, 1))\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The line plot above shows the progress of daily COVID19 vaccinations in the United States, China, India, and the United Kingdom (the four most advanced countries in terms of total vaccinations in the world).

The United States and India seem to have a steady incline since December 2020, while on the other hand, until March this year, the United Kingdom seems to not have done much prgress at all. This could be due to the large waiting list of countries in Euroupe that need the vaccine.

As a result, as shown in Figure.1, the number of infected people remains small. However, by the end of March, the number of infected people began to gradually increase, and lockdown countermeasures were taken in some areas.\nIn fact, when checking Table 1, it can be seen that the number of infected people began to rapidly increase around 3/20, and that they took precautionary measures against the rapid increase in the number of infected persons.\n\nAlthough the number of infected people continued to increase, the explosion increase of the patients could be avoided by extending the lockdown measures, and the worst situation such as medical collapse could be prevented. On the other hand, as concerns about economic impact such as an increase in the number of unemployed people have begun to appear, the government of India has a policy to gradually permit economic activities from June, except for the \"red zone\" where the number of coronavirus cases is high. \n\nHowever, there were problems with this policy. As a result of permitting economic activities, as shown in Fig. 1, the number of patients continues to increase, and more than 20,000 infected people was confirmed, which greatly exceeds the peak value so far in the middle of June. Also, As a result, as you can see from the figure, the number of patients increased rapidly, and in about two months, the cumulative number of patients increased to the fourth largest in the world (as shown #3)\nSuch a rapid increase in the number of patients may lead to medical collapse and is extremely dangerous. \nSince it was expected that the number of unemployed people will increase due to the lockdown, it is considered that the budget for the unemployed people should have been prepared.\n\nSource: \nWikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdown_in_India#Phase_1_(25_March_%E2%80%93_14_April)\nEmbassy of Japan in India, https://www.in.emb-japan.go.jp/itprtop_en/index.html","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

I'm still a beginner when it comes to data analysis/machine learning field,and I just wanted to try to make an exploratory data analysis on this dataset. If you have any suggestions/critics/recommendations for me in order to improve this work or my skills please go ahead and post it in the comments. Thanks! \n\nLet's get into this!\n\n\n![](https://mk0nationalecze819jj.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/health-care--e1495141013610.jpg)\n\n\nIn this notebook, I am going to try and examine the diffrent relations between every variable and the charges variable in order to know how every variable affect the medical charges costs.\n\n**Table of contents:**\n\n&emsp; <a href='#1'> 1.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There has been significant buzz in the NBA about teams practicing with a 4-point line in their gyms. They are doing this to spread the floor and create more opportunities on offence. Additionally, the Big3 has introduced 4-point shots in specific circles on the court. While I don't think that a 4-point line will ever be introduced into the NBA, it is a fun exercise to see where the numbers suggest that it should be placed on the court. \n\nIn my previous analysis I look at how far I believe that the 3-point line should actually be from the hoop: https://www.kaggle.com/kjeeone/how-far-should-the-3-point-line-actually-be. In this one, I evalaute a similar question related to a fabricated 4-point line.

The basis for this is that to make the 3-pointer less overpowering, we should make the points per shot of 3-point shots equal to those of 2-point shots. This equilibrium is met at 25.2' for this 2014-2015 dataset. \n\nWhen adding in the 4 point line, we will want to follow this same logic. We want the points per shot for 2-pointers == 3-pointers == 4-pointers.\n\nFor this analysis I will be using the 25.2' mark as the 3 point line because this is my hypothetical world where NBA decision making is based on math. \n\nIt should be noted that the 4-point line would technically shrink the number of shots in the 3-point line.

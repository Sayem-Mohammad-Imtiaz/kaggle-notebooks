Introduction\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Covid-19 and the following development of the vaccine, the world now faces the challenge of distributing the vaccine all around the world with the hope of returning back to the now acclaimed 'normality'. The progress seems positive at a first glance. But, with the limited amount of vaccines, the problem now seems to distribute the vaccine in a fair manner, allowing the less wealthy countries to have access to the vaccine.\n\nThis notebook analyses the data of latest Covid-19 Vaccine Status of all the Countries in the World as on 30 June, 2021 (https://www.kaggle.com/anandhuh/latest-worldwide-vaccine-data) and compares it with the data of the world happiness report (https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021). \n\nWhat story is behind the data?

A couple of hypothesis then come to my mind.\n\n- Is Uruguay doing better than europe and latin america because the importance they put on social support?\n- Is Western Union doing worst because they level of cooperation en distribution? this could also explain why Uruguay is so far from the latin america average, since the level of cooperation in this region is quite low.\n\n**Saudi Arabia**\nSaudi Arabia is more of a special case than Uruguay.

Conclusions\n- Countries in their regions are in different vaccination stage, which means that there's no evidence of cooperation between countries in their regions, this phenomenon is explained with the variance of the mean in seciton 3.1. Thats not the case for Western Europe, where the countries have a similar % of vaccinated population.\n\n- The trend in section 3.2. shows that the % of vaccinated population is directly related to the GDP of a country: the higher the GDP the higher the % of vaccinated population. This is not the case of Chile, since they are a medium level GDP but have a higher % of vaccinated population. This could be explained with the emphasis the country have on social support, factor that is higher than almost all of the high GDP countries.\n\n- A happy country is a vaccinated one. But do not rush with a direct causation. A happy country is the result of a combination of economic and social factors that usually make a developed country. Then, i would rather say that a developed country is a vaccinated one.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5. Recommendations\n\n- What is seen as a competition of what country has the highest vaccinated population should be seen as the region who is distributing its resources the best and even helping poor countries. For the analysis we see how Uruguay is way more advanced than the countries in its region and this is a sign of poor regional coordination. The job of Uruguay has been outsanding, but the coopeartion problem in the region is evident and transcends to other areas. It is then reccomended to better the relationships in each region for a better distribution and further cooperation in other areas.\n\n- The role of social support in Uruguay is also evident and the data back up its results with the level of vaccinated population. A country that cares about its people will also provide them. The reccomendation is to invest in entities and programs than promotes social support","metadata":{}}]}

This regularization aims to shrink the coefficients of the linear regression model therefore reducing the chance of overfitting.

It followed a framework of Inspecting the data, performing some EDA, engineering features, training and testing our data on multiple machine learning models and interpreting the results. We saw an improvement in model performance by trying a regularized regression algorithm as well as introducing interaction variables to the model.\n\nI'm relatively new to applied machine learning and am trying to get hands on experience using these algorithms through completing notebooks like this one. Some areas I didn't get a chance to tough on that I would have liked to in this notebook are:\n* Oulier detection and removal\n* Cross validation\n* Random Forest Regression\nAs I continue to grow my knowledge base and understanding I will come back and update this notebook. I'm always trying to learn and improve myself in this area so please feel free to leave comments and questions about this notebook!\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"ad7101c42c87031ae7b0f19dbd4755d453f120da"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

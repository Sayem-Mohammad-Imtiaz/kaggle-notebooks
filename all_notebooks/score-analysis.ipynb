From Fig 2 it can be observed that \n    * person with degree percentage above 80 % has high chances of getting placed.\n    * person with degree percentage below 55 % has lowest chances of getting placed.\n* With reference to Fig 2 and Fig 3 it can be said that out of 10 min 8 would be Female with degree percente above 80%\n* From Fig 4, we can identify there are few outlier and major of them are from Female\n* Fig 6, implies the Percentage seems most percentage is around 65 %, except for Female with work experience, they tend to have higher percentage which would be around 70%\n\n## I

We will focus on answering three main questions: What are some trends in smart device usage? How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n# The Data\n\nThe [data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) for this analysis comes from a dataset uploaded by the user arashnic on Kaggle called FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.  They collected this data from 33 respondents to a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk from 3/12/2016 to 5/12/2016 and contains entries from 4/12/2016 to 5/12/206.  There is one main file that contains the daily number of steps, calories, minutes of activity for each level, and the distance travelled.  Additional files breakdown the daily values by hour and minute, and others contain the users heartrate every 5 to 30 seconds, the amount of sleep they got each day, and the weight of some of the users.  The file containing the weight information only has data from 8 users, so this file will not be used as it is not enough data to perform an accurate analysis. Additionally, there is no further information on the people who submitted the data such as their age or gender.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Cleaning nad Organizing the Data\n\nFirst step is to import the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#import relevant libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\ndaily_activity = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_sleep = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nheartrate_seconds = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv\")\nminute_steps = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_mets = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv\")\nminute_calories = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv\")\nhourly_intensities = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nhourly_steps = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv\")\n\ndaily_activity.info()\ndaily_sleep.info()\nheartrate_seconds.info()\nminute_steps.info()\nminute_mets.info()\nminute_calories.info()\nhourly_intensities.info()\nhourly_steps.info()","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T06:19:51.833984Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T06:19:51.834353Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T06:19:59.54287Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T06:19:51.834308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T06:19:59.541772Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A quick query in BigQuery:\n\nSELECT Id, COUNT(ActivityDate) AS total_days\n\nFROM dailyActivity_merged.csv\n\nGROUP BY Id\n\nshows that not all users have 30 days of data.

A similar, but to a lesser degree, explanation could apply to the night between Saturday and Sunday, but it appears that more people consistently opted to either sleep in or go to bed early as the median line is quite high on the boxplot.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion and Recommendations\n\n### Exercise\n\nFitBit users overall do appear to exercise the recommended amount per week but do not reach the recommended 10,000 steps per day. Bellabeat could have the Bellabeat app notify users when they've reached 150 minutes a week of exercise and when they reach 10,000 steps. If the week is almost over and the user still has not reached these goals or if they are well below the average number of minutes and steps they would normally be at by that day, the app could send a notification either on the user's phone or their fitness tracker. A simple reminder could help users stay on track with their fitness goals.\n\nAlso, although calories were not closely analyzed in this report, Bellabeat could also consider adding a calorie tracker to the app. Users could log the foods they consume throughout the day, and the fitness tracker would tell the app how many calories the user burned that day. The app could then tell the user if they had a calorie surplus or deficit that day and tell users how to adjust their calorie intake to match their fitness goals.\n\n### Manual Logging\n\nThe data also suggests that users do not consistently manually log data. Only 8 users logged their weight, and of those 8, only one user had data for the whole month. Additionally, only 4 users every logged the distance for an activity. Bellabeat could try to reminder users to log information like their weight every week or so. It would be difficult for Bellabeat to create something that would automatically measure the user's weight without them stepping on a scale every week, so a simple reminder would be a simple compromise.\n\n### Heartrate\n\nMost fitness trackers today tend to measure the user's heartrate regularly. Bellabeat could have the app track the user's average resting heartrate as well as the heartrate while exercising. It could then notify users if their resting heartrate has gone down or up which can be a good indicator of whether their overal vascular health has improved or worsened. It would also be useful for the app to be able to take the informaion from the tracker to tell if the user is exercising or not. If the user is not exercising but their heartrate is elevated, the app could make a note of this and notify the user if it stays elevated for a certain amount of time. Elevated heartrate without exercise can be an idicator of stress or heart problems. If the user regularly has a spike in their heartrate at a certain time of day when they are sedentary, then it could be an indicator that something is happening in their life at that specific time that causes them a lot of stress or excitement. The user could then make an informed decision on ways they could reduce their stress.\n\n### Menstrual Cycle\n\nThe data does not indicate if the users are female or male or the age of each user. Since Bellabeat focuses on women and their health, the app could act as a menstrual cycle tracker for women who have not reached menopause yet. The app could then analyze how the user's menstrual cycle could be affecting their activity levels or the amount of sleep they get. This information could help users adjust their habits to accomodate for these changes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}

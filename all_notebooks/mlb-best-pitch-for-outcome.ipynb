Credit to https://www.kaggle.com/pschale/mlb-pitch-data-20152018 for providing the data I used for the analysis. However, in the 2019_pitches csv, there was one line that seemed to have a wrong outcome code that messed up my analysis, so I simply edited that one line and am instead using the fixed file as opposed to the original one provided. Any suggestions on how I can expand this topic or ways to improve are much appreciated as I'm still doing my best to learn more!

I did think cutters were interesting as they usually induce weak contact resulting in more grounders, but the data does not suggest this being the case. Fourseam fastballs isn't a surprise as it's the only pitch here that moves straight with minimal drop, making it easier to lift the ball on. Twoseamers and sinkers are virtually the same in terms on movement, so it makes since the odds are also virtually the same for both. They also can dive down sharply depending on the pitcher, which explains the heavy groundball rate. While curveballs are a tossup between results, knucklecurves lean more towards grounders which makes sense since knucklecurves traditionally have a sharper drop to them. Changeups and splitters also lean towards groundballs, but splitters lean that way a little more since they too have shaper break as opposed to changeups. I do find sliders a little interesting as they lean towards flyballs a little more. This could be since batters popup sliders more, or pitchers just simply aren't throwing well located sliders.\n\nNext, I'll be exploring another major factor that goes into wether a ball in play is a groundball or a flyball: Location. Mant baseball fans know that a well located pitch is arguably better than something with sharp break, but also down the middle of the plate. However, does the data support these assumptions?\n\nWe'll start with something that should be relatively predictable-sinkers\n\nWhile there isn't a visible strikezone in my plots, we can infer the general shape of it based off all called strikes in the 2019 season to make out a rough shape\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = plt.gca()\nstrikezone = pitches[pitches['code'] == 'C'] #Code for called strikes\nstrikezone.plot(kind='scatter',x='px',y='pz',color='orange',ax=ax)\nax.set_facecolor('teal')\nplt.xlim(-3,3)\nplt.ylim(0,4.5)\nplt.title(\"Called Strikes\")\nplt.xlabel('X Coordinate of Pitch Location')\nplt.ylabel('Z Coordinate of Pitch Location')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Beside some outliers, the location of most called strikes is pretty consistent with a clear shape shown.

The data shows the strikezone dimensions to go from -1.25 to 1.25 px, but since umpires extend strikezones a little, the true dimensions are more likely -1.1 to 1.1 or -1 to 1 px.

They also say you can drown in a pool who's average depth is 12 cm.   \nIn this script we try to move a little past \"the average kaggler\" and present \"the 12 typical kagglers\". \nThese are 12 imagined people that represent the kaggle community hopefully better than that of a single average kaggler.  \nThis will be analogous to the following: instead of talking about \"the pool's average depth is 12cm\" move on to talk about \"95% of the pool's area is 2 cm deep on average, and 5% of the pool's area is 2 meters deep on average\".  \n\nThis dataset holds the 2017 kaggle data science survay results. It is presented to us here in a very raw and unprocessed form (to say the least), so we'll first need to move quite a bit of data around before we can continue.  \n\nAfter a little bit of pre-processing we will look at correlations between several key data fields, and then continue to cluster analyize the ~16,000 kagglers that have answered this survey.\n\n**In the final and main** part of the script, we present a short summery paragraph of each kaggler type one by one.

Although ammonium can be found in nature and is a natural byproduct of biological processes, its use in manufacturing processes and as a component of fertilizers can lead to an unnatural increase in environmental levels. High ammonium levels can be toxic to fish, and promote algal blooms, which can harbor toxic cyanobacteria and affect drinking water quality. The content of the dataset states that the maximum permissible value of Ammonium ions concentration (NH4) in Ukraine is 0.5 mg/cub. dm.

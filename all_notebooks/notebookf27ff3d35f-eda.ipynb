In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Variables**:\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome.

Healthy blood glucose levels help reduce the risk of diabetes complications, such as blindness and the loss of limbs.

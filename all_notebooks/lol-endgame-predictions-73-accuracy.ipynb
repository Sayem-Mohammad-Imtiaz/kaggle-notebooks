Players choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills, and take down towers as you battle your way to victory. **The objective of this study is to try different models to predict, based on game data of the first 10 minutes, whether the winner is the blue team or not.** This dataset contains the first 10min. stats of approx. 10k ranked games (SOLO QUEUE) from a high ELO (DIAMOND I to MASTER). Players have roughly the same level.\n\n### Glossary\n\n* Warding totem: An item that a player can put on the map to reveal the nearby area. Very useful for map/objectives control.\n* Minions: NPC that belong to both teams. They give gold when killed by players.\n* Jungle minions: NPC that belong to NO TEAM. They give gold and buffs when killed by players.\n* Elite monsters: Monsters with high hp/damage that give a massive bonus (gold/XP/stats) when killed by a team.\n* Dragons: Elite monster which gives team bonus when killed. The 4th dragon killed by a team gives a massive stats bonus. The 5th dragon (Elder Dragon) offers a huge advantage to the team.\n* Herald: Elite monster which gives stats bonus when killed by the player. It helps to push a lane and destroys structures.\n* Towers: Structures you have to destroy to reach the enemy Nexus. They give gold.\n* Level: Champion level. Start at 1. Max is 18."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve, accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# First look at data\nurl = \"/kaggle/input/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min/high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv\"\ndata = pd.read_csv(url)\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# No missing data\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.columns.size","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at blue and red columns seperately.

Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.\n\n**What is Tokenizer?**\n\nTokenization is a necessary first step in many natural language processing tasks, such as word counting, parsing, spell checking, corpus generation, and statistical analysis of text.\n\nTokenizer is a compact pure-Python (2 and 3) executable program and module for tokenizing Icelandic text. It converts input text to streams of tokens, where each token is a separate word, punctuation sign, number/amount, date, e-mail, URL/URI, etc. It also segments the token stream into sentences, considering corner cases such as abbreviations and dates in the middle of sentences.[Tokenizer](https://pypi.org/project/tokenizer/)\n\n**What is Padding?**\n\nAs a same approach in Convolution Neural Network, Padding assure the input layer have the same shape for the model. \n\n**What is LSTM (long short term memory)?**\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition and anomaly detection in network traffic or IDS's (intrusion detection systems)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **2.

It is intended to serve as a benchmark for sentiment classification. This document outlines how the dataset was gathered, and how to use the files provided.\n\n**Dataset**\n\nThe core dataset contains 50,000 reviews. The overall distribution of labels is balanced (25k pos and 25k neg). We also include an additional 50,000 unlabeled documents for unsupervised learning.\n\nIn the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any given movie because reviews for the same movie tend to have correlated ratings. Further, the train and test sets contain a disjoint set of movies, so no significant performance is obtained by memorizing movie-unique terms and their associated with observed labels. In the labeled train/test sets, a negative review has a score <= 4 out of 10, and a positive review has a score >= 7 out of 10. Thus reviews with more neutral ratings are not included in the train/test sets. In the unsupervised set, reviews of any rating are included and there are an even number of reviews > 5 and <= 5."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **2.2 Data pre-processing**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first step is to load the data to global environment."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/IMDB Dataset.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To visualize the work and choose the proper approach to pre-process data and visualize the text data, here come some task as my defined.\n\n1) Data shape.

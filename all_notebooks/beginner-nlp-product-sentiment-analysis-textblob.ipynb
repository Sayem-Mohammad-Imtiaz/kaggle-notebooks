It provides a consistent API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.\n\nTextBlob is built upon the NLTK architecture and is much easier to use and faster for Beginners\n\nSome of the Features of TextBlob include\n\n- Sentiment analysis\n- Noun phrase extraction\n- Part-of-speech tagging\n- Tokenization (splitting text into words and sentences)\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Sentiment analysis**\n\nSentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.\n\nThe TextBlob Sentiment Analysis of TextBlob returns two properties\n1. Polarity\n2. Subjectivity\n\n\n### **Polarity**\n\nIt simply means emotions expressed in a sentence.\n\nEmotions are closely related to sentiments. The strength of a sentiment or opinion is typically linked to the intensity of certain emotions, e.g., joy and anger.\n\nThe range of the Polarity  lies in [-1.0,1.0] where 1 is a positive statment and -1 is negative statement. Values with 0 is Neutral statment\n\n\n### **Subjectivity**\n\nSubjective sentence expresses some personal individual feelings, views, or beliefs.\n\nThe range of Subjectivity is [0.0,1.0] where 0 is very objective and 1 is very Subjective.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **NLP Steps done by TextBlob for Sentiment Analysis**\n\n1.

Remove stop words, punctuation, or unwanted tokens eg The, was , and\n5. Tokenization - create a bag of words\n6.

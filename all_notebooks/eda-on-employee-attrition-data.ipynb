This dataset is about employee attrition data. Employee Attrition is the gradual reduction in staff numbers that occurs as employees retire or resign and are not replaced. Employee attrition can be costly for businesses. The company loses employee productivity, and employee knowledge. This is a fictional dataset created by IBM data scientists.

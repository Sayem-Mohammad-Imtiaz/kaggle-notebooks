Different BCG vaccine strains exist as a result of genetic changes that occurred during repeated subculture in different countries before lyophilisation was introduced for storage of seed lots in the 1960s. Increasing evidence suggests that these genetically divergent BCG vaccine strains are associated with different protective efficacy against tuberculosis (TB), different rates of adverse events and variable susceptibility to anti-tuberculous drugs.\n\nThere are currently four BCG vaccine suppliers for UNICEF/WHO/GAVI producing three different BCG vaccine strains: BCG-Denmark produced by the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark, BCG-Russia (which is genetically identical to BCG-Bulgaria) by Bulbio (BB-NCIPD) in Bulgaria and by the Serum Institute in India,25 and BCG-Japan by the Japan BCG Laboratory (personal communication from Katinka Rosenbom, UNICEF Supply Division, Copenhagen, Denmark)\n\nThe considerable variation in BCG vaccine strains used worldwide highlights the importance of documenting the particular vaccine strain used on an individual, local and national level.\n\nJournal homepage: http://intl.elsevierhealth.com/journals/tube","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/rmit-images/news/2020/may/bcg-vaccine/bcg-vaccine-article.jpeg)The BCG vaccine targets trained immunity, whereas most other vaccines target immune memory.

May 8, 2020\n\nAuthors: Kylie Quinn, Joanna Kirman, Katie Louise Flanagan, Magdalena Plebanski\n\nThere are two main types of cells within our immune system: innate cells, which respond rapidly to microbes that cause disease, and adaptive cells, which initially respond quite slowly.\n\nAdaptive cells include B cells, which make antibodies to block infection, and T cells, which can kill infected cells. Importantly, adaptive cells can remember particular microbes for years, or even decades, after we first encounter them.\n\nThis phenomenon is called “immune memory”.\n\nWhen adaptive immune cells encounter the same microbe a second or subsequent time, they respond much more quickly, and the immune system can effectively clear an infection before it causes disease. Immune memory is why often we don’t get infected with a specific microbe, like chickenpox, more than once.\n\nMost of our current vaccines exploit immune memory to protect us from infection.\n\nFor decades, scientists believed innate cells lacked the ability to remember previous encounters with microbes. However, we’ve recently learnt some innate cells, such as monocytes, can be “trained” during an encounter with a microbe. Training can program innate cells to activate more quickly when they next encounter a microbe – any microbe.\n\nSome live attenuated vaccines, such as BCG, can trigger trained immunity, which can enhance early control of other infections. This raises the tantalising possibility that BCG could train innate cells to improve early control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to reduce COVID-19 disease or even prevent infection.\n\nAnd as a bonus, BCG could potentially protect us against other pathogens too.https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/may/could-bcg-protect-against-the-coronavirus","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadssoldierscsv/soldiers.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'soldiers.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Australia reports highest daily death toll for COVID-19 31.08.2020\n\nMELBOURNE\n\nAustralia confirmed 41 coronavirus fatalities Monday, the highest daily number since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe number of cases in the country rose to 25,754 while the death toll reached 652, according to health officials.

In general we see such text as tweets, reviews on shopping website (Amazon reviews), customer emails, social media messages and comments, surveys, etc. \n#### It has become highly important for the businesses around the globe to provide value and receive feedway so as to improve upon the product or service being offered & sentiment analysis plays an important role in this.\n#### It has high implementation in the fields of marketing, sociology, economies, political science, etc. One big example is Trump's first electoral campaign where (one of the strategies) he targeted the citizens based on sentiments (twitter). "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### There are primarily 3 ways:\n#### 1) Rule-based methods\n#### 2) Feature-based methods\n#### 3) Embedding-based methods\n\n#### Rule based are the methods which involve set of manually crafted rules to identify subjectivity, polarity, or the subject of an opinion. These involve techniques like Stemming, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing, Lexicons (i.e. lists of words and expressions). Generally, two lists of polarized words (e.g. negative words such as bad, worst, ugly, etc and positive words such as good, best, beautiful, etc) are prepared. The number of positive and negative words that appear in a given text are counted. If the number of positive word appearances is greater than the number of negative word appearances, the system returns a positive sentiment, and vice versa. If the numbers are even, the system will return a neutral sentiment. Methods involve\n[AFINN](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn), [Bing Liu's lexicon](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), [MPQA subjectivity lexicon](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/), [SentiWordNet](http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/http://), [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) & [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)\n\n#### Since rule-based are generally naive in nature as don't take into account how words are combined in a sequence. Hence, feature-based methods relying on ML techniques like SVM, Decision trees, etc. are used where sentiment analysis is modeled as a classification problem. The first step in a machine learning text classifier is to transform the text extraction or text vectorization, and the classical approach has been bag-of-words or bag-of-ngrams with their frequency. More recently, new feature extraction techniques have been applied based on word embeddings (also known as word vectors). This kind of representations makes it possible for words with similar meaning to have a similar representation, which can improve the performance of classifiers.\n\n#### Last is embedding based which involve [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/supervised-tutorial.html) & [Flair](https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"3\"></a>\n    \n<font size=\"+2\" color=\"indigo\"><b>3.

Polarity is of 'float' type and lies in the range of -1,1, where 1 means a high positive sentiment, and -1 means a high negative sentiment.\n\n#### The output also prints subjectivity of the text which is 0.825 in our example. Subjectivity is also of 'float' type and lies in the range of 0,1. The value closer to 1 indicates that the sentence is mostly a public opinion and not a factual piece of information and vice versa.

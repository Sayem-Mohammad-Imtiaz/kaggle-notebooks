Measures to contain the impact of the pandemic must be reinforced.\n\nAbout 80% of women and 99% of adult men leave the house, allegedly to go shopping, to go to work or to do business, reveals a study released by the Manhiça Health Research Center.\n\nThe main source of survival for most Mozambicans is informal trade . \"They check daily that people, on average, were out of the house, before Covid-19, 1 pm. And after Covid, this time has only slightly reduced,\" \n\n\"And a large part of the people who left depend on that activity for their livelihood\". The Government should create a basic food basket to ensure that vulnerable families remain at home.\n\nAdvanced data at the conference also indicates that 40% of children do not stay at home, even though schools are closed.\nhttps://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://www.dw.com/pt-002/covid-19-distanciamento-social-%25C3%25A9-um-dos-principais-desafios-em-mo%25C3%25A7ambique/a-53864194&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##Young farmers launch \"Quarantine without hunger\"\n\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTQLVJfBuofxSkcHqVMkWCStDprResQ54ncjA&usqp=CAU)issuu.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Illness of cities and elites\n\nContrary to social detachment, the implementation of hand hygiene measures and the use of masks shows greater adherence.

The most urbanized areas have easy access to information and end up having some privilege in key messages, but it is necessary to cover the most ruralized areas\".\n\nIt was also found in a survey that half of the parents would allow their children to return to school if the cases of Covid-19 decreased and preventive conditions were created in schools. Already 100% of workers are ready to resume work, by taking preventive measures. \n\nMozambique ranks among the ten countries with the fastest pandemic doubling in the world.https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://www.dw.com/pt-002/covid-19-distanciamento-social-%25C3%25A9-um-dos-principais-desafios-em-mo%25C3%25A7ambique/a-53864194&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_world_atlas_data-bcg_strain-7July2020.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#We need to \"review priorities\": Social diseases, lack of solidarity, inequality, injustice, which have now become very clear.\n\nThe writer Mia Couto, who is also a biologist and a member of the Technical Scientific Committee on Covid-19, considers that it is necessary to look now at the impact of this pandemic on the future of society. \"If we go back to what we call normality, we will find a cure for this disease, but we will not find a cure for other older diseases that are social diseases, the lack of solidarity, inequality, injustice, which have now become very clear.\"\n\nMia Couto also defends that \"it is necessary to review the priorities that must be given.

Throughout this article I will analyze two particular variables, Alcohol and Health rating. Health rating in this dataset is rated from \"1-5\", \"1\" being least concerned about Health and \"5\" being highly concerned. Alcohol usage is categorized as \"drink a lot\", \"social drinker\" and \"never\". I will look at counts and proportions by grouping the two variables together and looking at the data from different perspectives.

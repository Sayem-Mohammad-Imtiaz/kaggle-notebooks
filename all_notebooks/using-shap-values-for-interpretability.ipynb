Contrary to interpretable methods, that produce predictions that can be explained by taking a look at the inner workings of the model, black box methods present the prediction as a mistery to the user. One of the most trivially interpretable methods, decision trees, provide a trivial way of interpreting: generating a binary decission tree: \"if X then A, else B\" is enough to traverse the tree checking each sample to understand their prediction. On the other hand, neural networks seem to magically fit to training data, and then use their obscure weights to spit a prediction. Similarly, gradient techniques like the ones used in XGBoost may use dozens of trees for regularization, rendering their interpretability as useless for most users.\n\nThis notebook aims to be both an introduction to [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap), which presents itself as \"a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model\", and a motivation to understand interpretability in a different way than it is popularly imagined. It is obvious for most data scientist that we will not be able to understand a neural network inner workings as trivially as the ones of a decision tree, but studying the relation between its input and outputs using an unified approach as SHAP can help the community (and with some pedagogy, a client) understand how a ML model is making predictions."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"28c562e5e8a2154afd2861cae9d612681246c418"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as pl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport shap\n\nshap.initjs()\n%matplotlib inline\n\nnp.random.seed(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"37d262b27065b56e017fa77f991481ad3c0204f4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The data: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset\n\nFor this demo, we will use the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, which contains 30 features extracted from an image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

This can be confusing now, but will get easier with the examples below.\n\nWe will compute these values for all the samples, `X`. This matrix, `shap_values`, is related with the training data: The element `shap_values[i, j]` is the SHAP value of the `i` sample's `j` feature.

In the second variable, the `perimeter_worst` variable is not as disperse in its SHAP values, but the majority of values are not in zero (which implies no influence in the prediction).\n\nWe can take a step down the abstraction scale and see individual features dependence plots. These graphs plot the feature's value respect to its SHAP value, letting us understand easily how they are related. SHAP also plots a second variables value, which is automatically chosen depending its interaction with the feature at hand. That way the library helps us find multi-dimensional dependences in the data.\n\nBelow we can see the dependence plot of `perimeter_worst`: as seen in the dependence plot, higher values of the variable are related to higher SHAP values. We can also see that this relation is not linear, but closer to having a threshold around 110.

We can see how the final SHAP value (which can be transformed from a continuous domain to probability using a sigmoid) is 2.29 and higher than the base value, therefore predicted as benign.

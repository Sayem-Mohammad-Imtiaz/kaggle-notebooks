So, classifiers with higher accuracy are always desired. A classifier with high accuracy offers very less chance to wrongly classify a patient of cancer. \n\nBreast cancer refers to cancer from a malignant tumor in the cells of the breast tissue. A malignant tumor is a group of cancer cells that can grow into surrounding tissues or spread to distant areas of the body. Breast cancer is uncontrolled multiplication of cells in breast tissue. A group of rapidly dividing cells may form a lump or architectural distortions. \n\nThere are two main classifications of tumors. One is known as **benign** and the other as **malignant**. A benign tumor is a tumor that does not invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body. A malignant tumor is a tumor that may invade its surrounding tissue or spread around the body.\n\n**Benign** tumors are **non-malignant/non-cancerous tumor**. A benign tumor is usually localized, and does not spread to other parts of the body.  **Malignant** tumors are **cancerous** growths. They are often resistant to treatment, may spread to other parts of the body and they sometimes recur after they were removed.\n\nThere are two aspects of diagnosis of cancerous cells while doing testing.  A **false-positive** test occurs when test results appear to be abnormal, even though there is actually no cancer. A **false-negative** is when test results show no cancer when there really is cancer.\n\nNo test is perfect: a perfect test would give only **true positive** and **true negative** results, but a good screening test should have a low rate of **false-positive** and **false-negative** results. **False-positive** results can create undue stress, anxiety, and can lead to other unnecessary testing. **False-negative** results can delay treatment. I feel that **false-negative is more dangerous** in case of cancer detection, because patient think that he do not have cancer and therefore he will not take any precation and medical treatment. Although cancerous cells keep growing inside and can lead to next phase of cancer. When again patient starting feel uncomfortable, then he may go for another round of testing, but by that time it may be too late to cure the cancer.\n\nSo, in this case we have emphasis more on find accurate false-negative rather than the accuracy rate.\n\nLet's explore a classification task with **Keras API for TF 2.0 with Early Stopping and Dropout Layer**.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Load the data**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport datetime\nimport math\nimport matplotlib\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Print versions of libraries\nprint(f\"Numpy version : Numpy {np.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"Pandas version : Pandas {pd.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"Matplotlib version : Matplotlib {matplotlib.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"Seaborn version : Seaborn {sns.__version__}\")\nprint(f\"Tensorflow version : Tensorflow {tf.__version__}\")\n\n#Magic function to display In-Notebook display\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Setting seabon style\nsns.set(style='darkgrid', palette='Set2')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data.csv', encoding = 'latin-1')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(10).T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Exploratory Data Analysis**\n\nOnce the data is read into python, we need to explore/clean/filter it before processing it for machine learning It involves adding/deleting few colums or rows, joining some other data, and handling qualitative variables like dates.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Attribute Information:**\n\n* 1) ID number\n* 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) \n\nAttribute 3-32:\n\nTen real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:\n\n* a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)\n* b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)\n* c) perimeter\n* d) area\n* e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)\n* f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)\n* g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)\n* h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)\n* i) symmetry\n* j) fractal dimension (\"coastline approximation\" - 1)\n\nThe **mean**, **standard error (se)** and **worst** or **largest** (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.

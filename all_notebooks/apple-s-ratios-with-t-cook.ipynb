Apple's revenue and profit more than tripled between 2011 and 2021, as the company constantly expanded the ecosystem of devices and services around its flagship product, the iPhone.\"\n\n\"Under Cook's leadership, Apple outperformed the broader market more than 3 to 1 over the past ten years, as the company's share price increased by more than 1,000 percent.\"\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/25610/apple-growth-under-tim-cook/?utm_source=Statista+Newsletters&utm_campaign=b4a4d299d4-All_InfographTicker_daily_COM_AM_KW29_2021_Mo_COPY&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_662f7ed75e-b4a4d299d4-315801217","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTFNk8kKoz72AgqYAZWL11R4G4DAGdMjLZLyDUXWPs9r-Y7c_IIrHn25CWeZ2BCDVLYf9Q&usqp=CAU)dokumen.tips","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df

With his experience at IBM, where he expedited supply chain management, Cook introduced some drastic changes in integrated marketing, product design, and manufacturing in Apple.

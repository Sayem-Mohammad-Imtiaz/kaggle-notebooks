To restate this, how would similarly sized houses be priced in different areas?\n\n* Are predicted health differences between two groups due to differences in their diets, or due to some other factor?\n\nIf you are familiar with linear or logistic regression models, partial dependence plots can be interepreted similarly to the coefficients in those models.  Though, partial dependence plots on sophisticated models can capture more complex patterns than coefficients from simple models.  If you aren't familiar with linear or logistic regressions, don't worry about this comparison.\n\nWe will show a couple examples, explain the interpretation of these plots, and then review the code to create these plots.\n\n# How it Works\n\nLike permutation importance, **partial dependence plots are calculated after a model has been fit.**  The model is fit on real data that has not been artificially manipulated in any way.  \n\nIn our soccer example, teams may differ in many ways. How many passes they made, shots they took, goals they scored, etc. At first glance, it seems difficult to disentangle the effect of these features.\n\nTo see how partial plots separate out the effect of each feature, we start by considering a single row of data. For example, that row of data might represent a team that had the ball 50% of the time, made 100 passes, took 10 shots and scored 1 goal.\n\nWe will use the fitted model to predict our outcome (probability their player won \"man of the game\"). But we **repeatedly alter the value for one variable** to make a series of predictions.  We could predict the outcome if the team had the ball only 40% of the time. We then predict with them having the ball 50% of the time.  Then predict again for 60%.  And so on.  We trace out predicted outcomes (on the vertical axis) as we move from small values of ball possession to large values (on the horizontal axis).\n\nIn this description, we used only a single row of data.  Interactions between features may cause the plot for a single row to be atypical.  So, we repeat that mental experiment with multiple rows from the original dataset, and we plot the average predicted outcome on the vertical axis.  \n\n# Code Example\n\nModel building isn't our focus, so we won't focus on the data exploration or model building code."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"45b88fc055a19fd1e01ad6e0c557357731cbc031","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-2018-match-statistics/FIFA 2018 Statistics.csv')\ny = (data['Man of the Match'] == \"Yes\")  # Convert from string \"Yes\"/\"No\" to binary\nfeature_names = [i for i in data.columns if data[i].dtype in [np.int64]]\nX = data[feature_names]\ntrain_X, val_X, train_y, val_y = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=1)\ntree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0, max_depth=5, min_samples_split=5).fit(train_X, train_y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"271bf4cf08f18a380ce7e4683e5cdcb1befd45d8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the sake of explanation, our first example uses a Decision Tree which you can see below.

The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\n* In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n* In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.\n\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically. \n\nBoth for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor. The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n\n**\nExample**\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/220px-KnnClassification.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/220px-KnnClassification.svg.png)\n\n\nAs you can see above on the Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).\n\n\n**Parameter selection**\n\nThe best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of k reduces effect of the noise on the classification[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)] but make boundaries between classes less distinct. \n\n\n**The 1-nearest neighbor classifier**\n\n\nThe most intuitive nearest neighbour type classifier is the one nearest neighbour classifier that assigns a point x to the class of its closest neighbour in the feature space, that is ![https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f815904edbff2ce82502172ec0dce3311d57f2bb](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f815904edbff2ce82502172ec0dce3311d57f2bb)\n\nAs the size of training data set approaches infinity, the one nearest neighbour classifier guarantees an error rate of no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is Confusion Matrix ?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Confusion Matrix is commonly used for a summarization of prediction results on a classification problem.The number of correct and incorrect predictions is summarized with counting values and each value broken down for each class.

Accuracy has two definitions:\n\n1. More commonly, it is a description of systematic errors, a measure of statistical bias; low accuracy causes a difference between a result and a \"true\" value. ISO calls this trueness.\n2. Alternatively, ISO defines[[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)] accuracy as describing a combination of both types of observational error above (random and systematic), so high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness.\n\n\n**Precision and Recall**\n\nAccording to [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)] Precision is a description of random errors, a measure of statistical variability.

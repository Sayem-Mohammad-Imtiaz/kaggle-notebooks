The number of farmers markets within a state has the strongest correlation with the population of that state.\n    - This can be expected, since a higher population increases both demand and supply of farmers markets.\n - The income of a state may have a positive effect on the number of farmers markets within the state but the correlation is still quite weak.\n    - This weak correlation could be explained by the fact that supply and demand of farmer's markets depends on investment and consumption decisions respectively. These dependencies are based on human behaviour and cultural influences, therefore they can both be quite unpredictable.\n\nLinks to observations:\n - This analysis predicts that the farmers markets in the U.S will be concentrated in areas with a higher population and income level. \n - Looking at the analysis:\n     - It appears that the combination of high-income and high-population in the western and north-eastern coastal states are responsible for the high concentration of farmers markets in these areas.\n     - The relatively high per capita income of the northern states appears to be a factor in the higher concentration of farmers markets in the area.\n     - The relatively high population of the south-eastern states seems to play a factor in the higher concentration of farmers markets in the area.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

It's common to set the parameter `n_jobs` equal to the number of cores on our machine. On smaller datasets, this won't help.\n\nThe resulting model won't be any better, so micro-optimizing for fitting time is typically nothing but a distraction.

This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n\nIn other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.\n\nThere are two main types of leakage: **target leakage** and **train-test contamination**.\n\n**Target Leakage**: Occurs when our predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n\nImagine we want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of our raw data look like this:\n<img src=\"https://imgur.com/BEf5da3.png\"/>\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. The raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns, but `took_antibiotic_medicine` is frequently changed after the value for `got_pneumonia` is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of False for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n\nBut the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y7hfTYe.png\"/>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Train-Test Contamination**\n\nA different type of leak occurs when we aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.\n\nRecall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. We can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination.\n\nFor example, imagine we run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling `train_test_split()`. The end result? Our model may get good validation scores, giving us great confidence in it, but perform poorly when we deploy it to make decisions.\n\nAfter all, we incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when we do more complex feature engineering.\n\nIf our validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if we use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Read the data\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/aer-credit-card-data/AER_credit_card_data.csv', \n                   true_values = ['yes'], false_values = ['no'])\n\n# Select target\ny = data.card\n\n# Select predictors\nX = data.drop(['card'], axis=1)\n\nprint(\"Number of rows in the dataset:\", X.shape[0])\nX.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# small dataset so we will use cross validation\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n\nmy_pipeline = make_pipeline(RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100))\nscores = cross_val_score(my_pipeline, X, y,\n                        cv=5,\n                        scoring='accuracy')\n\nprint(\"Cross-validation accuracy: %f\" % scores.mean())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"98% accuracy doesn't happen often so enquire for target leakage.\n\nHere is a summary of the data:\n\n- **card**: 1 if credit card application accepted, 0 if not\n- **reports**: Number of major derogatory reports\n- **age**: Age n years plus twelfths of a year\n- **income**: Yearly income (divided by 10,000)\n- **share**: Ratio of monthly credit card expenditure to yearly income\n- **expenditure**: Average monthly credit card expenditure\n- **owner**: 1 if owns home, 0 if rents\n- **selfempl**: 1 if self-employed, 0 if not\n- **dependents**: 1 + number of dependents\n- **months**: Months living at current address\n- **majorcards**: Number of major credit cards held\n- **active**: Number of active credit accounts\n\nA few variables look suspicious.

Careful separation of training and validation data can prevent train-test contamination, and pipelines can help implement this separation. Likewise, a combination of caution, common sense, and data exploration can help identify target leakage.\n\nExercises of this tutorial are solved [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mahendrabishnoi2/exercise-data-leakage)\n\n---"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

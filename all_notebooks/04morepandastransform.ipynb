We have seen some of this when we discussed *Groupby*, let us use the *agg* method here to show how much more we can do. \n\nFirst we import the data as well as the usual modules. We will introduce a new module here called [numpy](https://numpy.org/). It is one of the most important modules in Python for numerical computation as it defines *multi-dimensional* array and their associated operations. It also contains some of the most common mathematical functions.

This will help us understand how common is for producers to identify a good movie when they see one.\n\n- Which countries produces the best and worst movies? Within them, which ones get closer to the high rates?\n\n- Do people go with what they already know when it comes to movies or they try new things? Maybe analysing the director's Facebook likes and the movie's Facebook likes will give us better insights. \n\n- Have scores become better or worse with the years? Analysing the IMDB scores average over each decade may show us this information.\n\nFirst, we need to read the file.","outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"ff291dfa-9abd-4554-8be7-90dc4c179836","_uuid":"0680820430a74af0202b0ecd48f151ef5fdfdaa7"},"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sn#for visuals\nsn.set(style=\"white\", color_codes=True)#customizes the graphs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as mp #for visuals\n%matplotlib inline\nimport warnings #suppress certain warnings from libraries\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\nmovie_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/movie_metadata.csv\")\nmovie_data","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"79750f4a-7f84-40ab-ad75-d0fb3f1894ea","_uuid":"b65f0fe9b90bf0a38af79d6d5663051f5f9dbfc4"},"source":"Getting a glimpse of the size of the dataset.","outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"4ddec0ec-9261-4a28-a9fe-2a70889afca9","_uuid":"e937ada81964825e6a2dcc6cde30ff4fe3f2e5f2"},"source":"movie_data.shape","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"0d0300cf-c609-4c13-8d6e-cffeadce6b3f","_uuid":"81d41b219633437758bb6774c312fc6f0e1e3399"},"source":"Taking a peak at the first 10 rows of data","outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"b74afb96-5477-4db7-9d18-3411fc03b8d6","_uuid":"f8cf331b6b362b4f5842a56ad57c08c420b23a59"},"source":"movie_data.head(10)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"ff2287d4-34a8-4952-a23e-ae4a69963035","_uuid":"b659f04fcf7ddba9cf9b7b0160dc048f8fae66d1"},"source":" Comparing variables to each other","outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"b9b34580-696f-4b8d-b532-ed6429d20cf0","_uuid":"0425ee43fcf6f9a9b482a9b30d2929589748e96d"},"source":"movie_data.corr()","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"collapsed":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"f34ed928-c87d-49fc-89da-5b80c51343b3","_uuid":"1e8b16a4a19319614428e7d507724e1fa5b7d377"},"source":"- What does a negative value mean?\nAn insignificant or non-existing relationship between the variables, their results has nothing to do with each other.\n\n- What does a positive value mean?\nMeans that there's a dependence within two variables, one may affect the other one with a lower or higher impact. \n\n- What does a higher number mean versus a lower number?\nIt will show us if the dependency between variables is bigger or smaller, if its a high number the impact of one variable over the other one will most likely affect the result, such as the gross profit and the number of Facebook likes.

My goal was to determine a somewhat systematic method of doing so; the \napproach that I converged on was to model the movement of a taxi as a random walk and\napproximate the likelihood of each coordinate pair given the other coordinate pairs in\na sequence.\n\nTo speed up the process of investigation, I only used the first 1000 rows of the data set\nand assumed that it was representative of the rest of the data. After doing the analysis,\nI discovered that this might not be true (in particular, there are a couple long trips in\nlater segments).

I'll be honest, the weights $w_i = (n+1)^3/(i+1)^3$ were arbitrarily chosen to indicate that we care more about the shape of the curve for small time offsets than later on. Furthermore, observe that the inital slope of the line is given by $a/b$ and the limiting value as $t\\to\\infty$ is given by $a$. The value of $b$ gives a good idea of where the \"elbow\" of the function exists. For example,\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha &= \\frac{x}{x+b} \\\\\n\\alpha x + \\alpha b &= x \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\right)b &= x \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\nindicates the value of $x$ where the function has reached $\\alpha$ of it's maximum value. Let's define the elbow as the value where $\\alpha=0.8$; i.e. $x_0=4b$. In the above case, the elbow is at a time offset of approximately 20 minutes. This is a useful quantity because it indicates the amount of time that we can consider the GPS points in a particular taxi route to be correlated.\n\nSo how can we use this to detect invalid GPS coordinates? We can frame this using Bayesian probability as such: let $x_i$ be a location in a route, and $r_i$ be the rest of the locations in that route. Apply Bayes Rule: $$P(x_i | r_i) = \\frac{P(r_i | x_i) P(r_i)}{P(x_i)} .$$ Assume that $P(x_i)$ and $P(r_i)$ are constant for a particular route. Furthermore, assume $P(x_{j\\ne i} | x_i)$ are independent (a naive Bayes). Then:\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log{P(x_i | r_i)} &= C + \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\log P(x_j | x_i) \\\\\n &= C + \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\frac{-d(x_i,x_j)^2}{2\\sigma_{ij}^2} - \\log \\sigma_{ij} , \\\\\n \\end{aligned}\n where $C$ absorbs constant offsets and $\\sigma_{ij}$ is the standard deviation of the random walk distances (estimated by the curve shown above)\n . Clearly, this is maximized when $\\forall i \\ne j, \\, d(x_i,x_j) =0$ (the taxi never moves). Define the log-likelihood ratio as $$LR(x_i | r_i) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j \\ne i} \\frac{d(x_i,x_j)^2}{\\sigma_{ij}^2} .$$\n This quantity estimates the probability of the rest of the taxi's route given a single location, divided by the probability of a route where it never moves.

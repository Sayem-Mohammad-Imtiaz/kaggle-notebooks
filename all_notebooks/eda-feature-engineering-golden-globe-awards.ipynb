Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Golden Globe awards.\n\nI was inspired to undertake EDA on this dataset, as I was watching the highlights in the early Jan 2020 and being a fan of movies myself, I wanted to learn more.\n\nIn this notebook, we will be exploring the data, focusing on feature engineering and interesting insights from this dataset.\n\nPlease upvote if you found it interesting and would be much appreciated.\n\n![Golden_Globe](http://richiewong.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/golden-globe-atmosphere-4.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#

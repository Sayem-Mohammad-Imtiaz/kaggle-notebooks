For example, at the time of writing, Cristiano Ronaldo's rating at RW/LW is 91, while the calculator gives him a rating of 94 in these positions. This project looks at the calculated ratings for every player in every position and tries to come up with more accurate values. We find that even a simple linear regression of the predicted values (according to the sofifa.com calculator) against the actual values gives us a better model.\n\n# Methods\n\nMost of the work in this project was in implementing sofifa.com's rating calculator in Python, and vectorising it so that it could take a dataframe as an input. This part is too long and complicated to be displayed in a notebook, but you can look at the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/kevinheavey/fifa18_player_rating_calculator). The gist of sofifa's method is that they use a different linear combination of a player's main attributes (e.g. acceleration, finishing etc.) for each position, and then apply a bonus based on the player's international reputation, and then check that the player's position rating isn't above their potential.\n\nIn the code below we use a dataframe of predicted ratings (`calculated_ratings`) that were calculated using our Python player rating calculator. If you clone the GitHub repository you can plug the `complete_player_data` dataframe below into `calculate_ratings_from_frame`and see that it gives the same values as in `calculated_ratings`.

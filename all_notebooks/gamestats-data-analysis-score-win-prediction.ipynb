How does one measure the difficulty of a level? A first-cut solution is\nto make an auto-play bot that is not perfect, and see how well the bot does on each level, using thousands of trials.\n\n## Purpose of the notebook\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to analyse the data provided by the game and extract some insights about the functionality of the game. What makes the game hard? is there a factor that might help a player win? can we predict the outcome of the game based on the data? valuable insight can be useful to make the game a challenging one but yet a fun one to play.\n\n## Features of the dataset\n\n- Date: date and time the game was auto-played\n- Level: the name of the level (the 3-digit number is an estimate of the difficulty from a previous run, no longer valid after tweaking)\n- NumBlocks: how many blocks have to be broken to win the level\n- IsWin: True if autoplay broke all the blocks, False if the ball fell past the paddle.\n- ElapsedTime: Seconds until either won or lost (game is played at 4x speed, so multiply by 4 to get an estimate of how long a human might play it)\n- Score: total score when the game was won or lost\n- Accuracy: the autoplay is tuned with a randomly-chosen accuracy. Higher numbers are more likely to win."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

things;\n\nUnique locations.\n\nVolume by location.\n.\nLocations with highest & lowest volumes.\n\nAverage prices (overall and by type).\n\nSpread of the average price.\n\nMonthly trend of average prices according to each year, etc.\n\n\n##### However, there's still a lot more insights we can get from this data, such as;\n\nInsights from sub regions/sub totals which I filtered out,\n\nAdvanced time series analysis, and,\n\nPredictive analysis to know what the prices could be like in future.\n\nI will be addressing these in subsequent projects.

This indicates that, if the relation with family is very bad, then your grade is fluctuating depending of your Pstatus.\n\n- Famrel 2: The mean appears to be same for both the Pstatus, but for students whose parents are together, tend to have a minute bimodal curve towards the lower grade. But overall in this case students whose parents are apart tend to slightly perform better than the others.\n\n- Famrel 3: This is a really odd curve. One hand we observe that for students whose parents are away, most students have a way better hrade average compared to the others, but on the other hand for the students whose parents are together, there is a minute chance that they score higher(evident from the top of the violin)\n\n- Famrel 4: In this case the students whose parents are together perform better and many of them are in the given average range\n\n- Famrel 5: Here the students whose parents are apart completely outshine the ones whose parents are together and have a better average, higher and a lower grade than the others.\n\nLooking at the average grades we see that students whose parents are apart tend to perform better in most cases.

Determining Least Significant Variable by P-Value\n\nIf the base model gives 0.7 R2 score and the model without a feature gives 0.75 R2 score, we cannot conclude that feature makes the difference, as the score may vary in another trial; in 10 trials the R2 score might change in +/- 0.05. However, if model only varies in +/- 0.01, we can then say that removing a feature made the model better.\n\nOur null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two samples of R2 scores.\n\nP-value is the probability that you would arrive at the same results as the null hypothesis. One of the most commonly used p-value is 0.05. If the calculated p-value turns out to be less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is considered to be false, or nullified (hence the name null hypothesis). And if the value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis is considered to be true.\n\nFor a feature, a small p-value indicates that it is unlikely we will observe a relationship between the predictor (feature) and response (salary in our case) variables due to chance.\n\nThus, we start with all features. We compute the P-values. We eliminate frature with highest p-value until p-values of all features reach below threshold: 0.05. \n\n![Determining Least Significant Variable by P-Value](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Jub_nEYtN0htxFpTRzRtBQ.png)\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Converting to DF for as  column names gives readibility\nX_scaled = pd.DataFrame(X_scaled, columns=column_names)\ny = y.values\n\n# We must add a constants 1s for intercept before doing Linear Regression with statsmodel\nX_scaled = sm.add_constant(X_scaled)\nX_scaled.head()\n#Constants 1 added for intercept term","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1: With all Features\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Identify max P-value (P>|t|) column\n# Feature ssc_p has 0.995\n#drop ssc_p\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('ssc_p', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# specialisation has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Identify max P-value (P>|t|) column\n# Feature specialisation has 0.759\n#drop specialisation\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('specialisation', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# degree_p has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Increase in Adjusted R2\n# Feature degree_p has 0.657\n#drop degree_p\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('degree_p', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# workex has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Increase in Adjusted R2\n# Feature workex has 0.337\n#drop workex\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('workex', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# hsc_p has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Increase in Adjusted R2\n# Feature hsc_p has 0.444\n#drop hsc_p\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('hsc_p', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# etest_p has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Slight Decrease in Adjusted R2..\n# Feature etest_p has 0.2\n#drop etest_p\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('etest_p', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# hsc_s has max P-Value and is greater than 0.05\n# Drastic Decrease in Adjusted R2..\n# Feature hsc_s has 0.09\n#drop hsc_s\nX_scaled = X_scaled.drop('hsc_s', axis=1)\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X_scaled)\nresults = model.fit()\nresults.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Stopping here. mba_p -> 0.06 only a bit higher than 0.05","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thus, Top 5 Features affecting salary we identified are:\n* gender -> Gender\n* degree_t -> Under Graduation(Degree type)- Field of degree education\n* mba_p -> MBA percentage\n* hsc_s -> Specialization in Higher Secondary Education\n* etest_p -> Employability test percentage \n\n\n(Same as with Sequential Feature Selection with mlxtend considering R2)","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Predicting Track Popularity\n\nThis was my final project for my data science class at Brainstation.\n\n\n## Spotify Dataset\n\nThe dataset is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv). This has a sample of 160,000 songs from Spotify, and there are additional sheets that aggregate data by artist, year, or genre. \n\nSpotify provides these audio features for a track:\n- **Acousticness:** A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\n- **Danceability:** How suitable a track is for dancing, from 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable). \n- **Duration**: The song length, in milliseconds - this typically ranges from 200k to 300k \n- **Energy:** A measure that represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity, from 0.0 (low energy) to 1.0 (high energy).\n- **Explicit**: The binary value whether the track contains explicit content (1) or not (0).\n- **Instrumentalness:** Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer this is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n- **Liveness:** Whether there's a live audience in the recording, from 0.0 (low probablity) to 1.0 (high probability). A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n- **Loudness:** The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB), with a typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n- **Popularity:** The popularity of a track in the US based on how frequently and recently it's played. Ranges from 0 (obscure) to 100 (very popular). \n- **Speechiness:** Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music. 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech. The track has more spoken word from 0.66 to 1.0.\n- **Tempo:** The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM).\n- **Valence:** A measure from 0.0 (more negative) to 1.0 (positive) describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. \n\nMore details about what these audio features mean are [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).\n\nI chose this dataset for a few reasons:\n- I'm on Spotify frequently (almost every day).\n- I did a project a few months ago that used Spotify data, a data visualization of the 100 greatest metal albums. It was a fun way to understand and interpret music, and I have some familiarity with Spotify's audio data.  \n- This is a very extensive dataset that's nicely formatted.

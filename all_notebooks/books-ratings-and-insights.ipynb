This is interesting because the following points explore the limits of the dataset, which is key to understanding future possibilities.\n\n* Can we make recommendations based on types/genres of books?\n - No, we cannot do this right now because the genre info is missing from the dataset. So, what can we do? We could fetch the genre info corresponding to each book and then add it to the dataset. Using the new dataset, we can make recommendations based on relevant features such as genre, rating, reviews etc.\n \n* Can we track the popularity of the books over time?\n    - This is not possible with the current dataset because there is no time information in it right? Its partly true. Its true that there is no direct date of publishing in the dataset, but we have the isbn number which can be used to track down the date of publishing. So what about popularity? We can measure popularity using the average_ratings column. By using this column, number of reviews and the date of publishing we can get a rough idea of how the book's popularity has stood the test of time. For example, if a book published in 1990 has a rating of 4.5 in 2013, then it can be regarded as an all-time favorite. Its true that we might end up missing extreme lows and extreme highs in its history, but we can say with confidence that as of now the book has so and so rating and has a good (or bad) rating when compared to a similar book (of similar age).

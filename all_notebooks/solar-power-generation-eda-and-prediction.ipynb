The data, as we know from the description, spans 34 days and contains information regarding power generation and weather data for each site. The data for each site is broken into two different data sets, which will be merged later in this notebook. \n\nBriefly, solar power generation works by placing solar panels on the earth, usually in areas that receive as much direct sunlight as possible throughout the day. Photons (or particles of light) knock electrons free of atoms, which generates an electrical flow. This electrical current can be used as DC power or passed through and inverter and converted to AC power. More information is readily available on the internet and it is left to the reader to discover more should they wish to.

Several different models are examined here. Here, we import the modules we need for predictive analysis (though this could be done in the first step also) and then dataframes have their features reduced even further, limiting them to just the module temperature, irradiation, ambient temperature and the DC Power output.

Looking back to the pair plots and the heatmap above, there is correlation between irradiation and ambient temperature.\n\nThinking this through, module temperature is most likely a dependent variable of environmental conditions, namely, what the ambient temperature is and how much irradiation there is. Actually irradiation is really the determining factor in ambient temperature as well. The more intense the irradiation at the site location, the warmer the ground and air will be. So both ambient and module temperatures could feasibly be predicted based on irradiation. If there is correlation between irradiation and temperature, then there is correlation between temperature and irradation.

So, how accurate is the model at predicting DC Power output based on ambient temperature. Well, it's a little tough to tell. The $R^2$ value for DC Power prediction based on the ambient temperature is not great at either site. But, the goal isn't *exactly* to predict the DC Power from the ambient temperature. The goal of this model is to predict what the DC Power output would be on a given day when a user *knows* the ambient temperature for that day. This actually requires that a user have a forecast for the next day (or few days) and he or she can then put that information into this model and get a prediction of the power output. Again, since everyone has weather prediction power at their fingertips this is perhaps feasible for the average person using this model. And while the sklearn linear regression model is used here, the same result could frankly be achieved with any linear regression estimator, even in Excel. It's hardly machine learning. And, perhaps surprisingly to some, **that's ok!**. A successful predictive model does not have to incorporate machine learning.\n\nBut still, the task requested is to create a model that predicts DC power output on a given day. The model doesn't have to use just one feature. There are other options that can be used to predict the DC power output. First off, look at the graphs above: the general trend of the predictive model isn't far from the actual data. There are peaks in the predicted output where there are peaks in the expected output. There are a few pieces of the plot (like at 2020-05-29 at Site 2) where the predicted maybe going below 0, but that's ok for now. Those values can be normalized later. So this is \"directionally\" correct. But the peaks of the predicted model never seem to reach the peaks of the expected model. Quantifying this predicted data against the actual power output is as easy as calling the $R^2$ score.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(fr'The R\\u00b2 value for Site 1 is {r2_score(m1_red.DC_POWER,y1_pred):.3f}')\nprint(fr'The R\\u00b2 value for Site 1 is {r2_score(m2_red.DC_POWER,y2_pred):.3f}')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-20T11:43:01.636391Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-20T11:43:01.636676Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-20T11:43:01.645204Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-20T11:43:01.636648Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-20T11:43:01.644321Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well, to say those are not great $R^2$ values is an understatement.

Random splits with time series data will lose the inherent sequential aspect of a time dependent relationship. \n\nAnother feature to examine, given it's high correlation would be module temperature.

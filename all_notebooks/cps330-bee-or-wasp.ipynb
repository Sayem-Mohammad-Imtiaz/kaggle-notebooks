Throughout this notebook there are markdown cells with instructions and questions for you to answer.  After each question is a markdown cell for your answer -- double click on the markdown cell to edit it.  You only need to single click on a code cell to edit it.\n\nAt a minimum, complete all the cells in this notebook.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport cv2\nimport os\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read CSV file with labels and data file names","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ROOT = '/kaggle/input/bee-vs-wasp/kaggle_bee_vs_wasp'\ndf = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(ROOT, 'labels.csv'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Be sure you know what the pandas method `read_csv()` does (look it up if you need to).\n\nThe `os.path.join()` function connects two or more strings representing parts of a valid path with the OS-specific path separator (slash on Mac OS X and Linux and backslash on Windows).\n\nCreate a new code cell (move your mouse pointer directly below this cell and click on the \"+ Code\" button) and execute the command `df.head()`.

NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)*. I also want to point out Jeremy Howard's [kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/nb-svm-strong-linear-baseline) from the earlier *[Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)* which served as an inspiration for this notebook.\n\nWhile many other notebooks in this competition focus on the application of complex deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks and transformers with pre-trained weights, I want to present another approach by training a fairly simple classification model from scratch that nevertheless delivers surprisingly good results.\n\nThe model I will use was introduced in this [paper](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf) by Sida Wang and Christopher D. Manning. The paper shows that while Naive Bayes (NB) usually performs better on text classification problems with short input sequences and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are better on longer sequences, a combined approach that uses NB log-count ratios as input features to SVM performs consistently well on a variety of classification tasks and datasets with different sequence lenghts. In line with the above-mentioned kernel I will use a Logistic Regression model instead of SVM, which according to the paper should give similar results."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The notebook will have the following structure:\n1.

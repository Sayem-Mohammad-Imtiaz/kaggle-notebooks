That dataset features audio recordings that have very few wild bird sounds but include a variety of other non-target sounds (from the perspective of a birder). These were all recorded (by me) on smartphones. Most recordings are from Missouri. Perhaps they might be of use in the BirdCLEF 2021 competition. \n\nThe visualizations below show the first five seconds of each audio clip, followed by the relevant metadata for that file. Spectrograms shown here use a linear scale. \n\nReminder: The sample rate is 48 kHz for these.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport librosa\nimport librosa.display\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n#from IPython.display import display\nimport os\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"metadata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/not-the-sounds-of-silence/background_sounds_metadata.csv\")\nSAMPLE_RATE = 48000\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        if filename.split(\".\")[1]==\"wav\":\n            pathfile = os.path.join(dirname, filename)\n   \n            audio_path = pathfile\n            sig, rate = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=SAMPLE_RATE, offset=0, duration=5)\n            spec = librosa.stft(sig)\n            spec_db = librosa.amplitude_to_db(abs(spec), ref=np.max)\n            # Plot the spectrogram\n            plt.figure(figsize=(15, 7))\n            librosa.display.specshow(spec_db, \n                             sr=SAMPLE_RATE, \n                             x_axis='time', \n                             y_axis='hz', \n                             cmap=plt.get_cmap('viridis'))\n            plt.locator_params(axis=\"x\", nbins=16)\n            plt.ylim((0,14000))\n            plt.title(audio_path)\n            plt.show()\n            todisplay = metadata[metadata['filename'] == filename]\n            display(todisplay)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nLicense\n\nCopyright 2021 J.M.

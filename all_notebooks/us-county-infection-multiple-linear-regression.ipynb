I will be utilizing various datasets concerning county health information, county COVID-19 infection rates, county population densities, and state political affiliation. In turn, I will attempt to identify and evaluate risk factors connected to infection rates by doing multiple regression analysis. The resultant linear regression model would be used mainly for interpretation. The outcome of the study could be used to better understand a population's vulnerability to COVID-19 based on the community's characteristics from the reference point of the American counties.

The first factor seems to encompass a lot of indexes related to general well-being. Some of its most substantial positive loadings(> .8) are for the years of potential life lost rate, the percentage of fair or poor health, the percentage of smokers, the percentage of physical or mental distress, and child poverty percentage. Some of its most substantial negative loadings(< -.7) are for median household income, life expectancy, general income, and college percentage. It explains a lot of variables connected to welfare in high coefficients. And its positive direction is towards poor welfare. Based on the loadings, I can identify this factor as **poor general well-being** with decent confidence.\n\n2. The second factor has apparent connections to variables related to housing issues. Its biggest loadings(> .8) are for the percentage of severe housing problems, severe housing cost burden, and the percentage of severe housing cost burden. The percentage of homeowners has the lowest loadings for this factor. It is convincing that this factor is for **housing burden**.\n\n3. The third factor seems to be connected to the prevalence of hispanic population. Its most substantial positive loadings(> 0.8) are for the percentage of hispanic population and the percentage of people not proficient in English. Its most vigorous negative factor loading is for the percentage of non-hispanic white population(~-.52). Other variables, such as housing problems and youth population, with lower factor loadings also seem to make sense for hispanic population prevalence. As a result, I would determine this factor to be **hispanic relative population size**.  \n\n4. The fourth factor is mostly about suicide rates in the opposite direction, so we could interpret this to be **inverse suicide rate**.\n\n5. The fifth factor is for **uninsured rate** because that's all its concerns with high loadings.\n\n6. The sixth factor has mostly to do with care provider rates such as dentist and mental health(> .5). It seems to be inversely connected with rural percentage and long commute. Although its loadings are relatively weaker, we can probably conclude that it is for **care provider accessibility**.\n\n7. The seventh factor seems to be about the population age as the extreme youth percentage has a positive loading(> .55), and the senior percentage has a very negative loading(< -.86). We can somewhat conclude that this factor is for **population youth**.\n\n8. The eighth factor seems to be mostly about the crime rate and its contributing factors, so we will determine this as **crime risk**.\n\n9. The ninth factor should have weak loadings overall. The theme seems to be about the overall income as it includes median household income, 80th & 20th percentile income, long commute, and white household income. We will loosely define this factor to be about **overall income level**.\n\n10. The tenth factor seems to be highly related to population density. Its highest loadings are for density in km(\\~.66), traffic volumn(\\~.4), and Asian population(\\~.48), while its lowest loadings are related to lone drive to work. It is clear that this factor is about **population density level**.\n\n11. The ninth factor should be somewhat apparent, with its two biggest loadings being the percentage of American Indian Alaska Native(.75) and inadequate kitchen or plumbing facilities(.71). We will determine this factor to be about **native relative population size**.\n\n12. The twelveth factor seems to be mainly connected to black population. Its most significant loading is for the percentage of black population(~.44). A lot of its other loadings are seemingly problems more common in black communities. Some examples are low high school graduation rate, crime rate, and single parent households. One of its negative loadings is the percentage of non-hispanic white population. I think we can determine that this factor is for **black relative population size**.\n\n13. The thirteenth factor seems to be about urbanization with its most negative loading being about rural percentage and its most positive one about access to exercise opportunities. The [latter](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/county-health-rankings-model/health-factors/health-behaviors/diet-exercise/access-to-exercise-opportunities) is defined to be specifically about facilities, which are more plentiful in an urban environment. As a result, we will determine this factor to be about **urbanization level**.\n\n14. The fourteenth factor is also straightforward as its loadings are all about food. We will determine it to be about **poor food environment index** due to its related variables and their directions.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Please note that these interpreations are purely subjective and could be done better with more domain knowledge.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fa.get_factor_variance()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Together the 14 factors explain about 74% of the total variance.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now with the factors interpreted, let's transform the original columns into factor scores, and append `_fa_score` to the factor names.

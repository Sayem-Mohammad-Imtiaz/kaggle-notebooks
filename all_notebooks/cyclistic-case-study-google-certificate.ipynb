How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n\nFrom the analysis and visualization,we were able to monitor the and as well as differentiate between casual and member riders.According to the graph,**Casual** riders mostly spend moretime riding on the bikes on friday,wednesday and thurdays.But **Member** riders spend moretime riding on weekends then monday.But on a general riders do spend more time ridng on  weekends.\nAlso with analysis based on monthly usage;the following observation was made:From the graph it shows **August** is month most riders  spend more time riding followed by: July,March,September,Febuary,June.\nfurthermore with respect types of riders with to it is evident from the graph,With Casual riders,the highest average time spend on riding is in **January**,but with Member riders, the highest average time spend on riding is in **July**.\n\n#### 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? \nFrom the analysis,use the daily to help convert casual riders to member riders,we see casual rider spend more times riding hence we have design attractive packages and discounts for casual users willing to become member riders.This will help convince them to buy annual membership in order to enjoy the package and discount.\n\n\n#### 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\nuse the monthly data to plan towards seasonal periods.This because we know the months that have highest average time that is spent ,hence we will know when to run campaigns to attract potential riders.Also since the general amount of time increases on weekends,adverstisement and promotion should be done on weekends .","metadata":{}}]}

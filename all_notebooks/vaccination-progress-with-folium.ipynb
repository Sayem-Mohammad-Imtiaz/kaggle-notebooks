A choropleth map is a map that represents patterns using coloration based on certain geographic boundaries. In my example, I am going to use country boundaries to explore how many total vaccinations have been given in each country. Green countries have the most vaccinations per 100 people and red countries have the least.\n\nA choropleth map can be used to show univariate data over a geographic region. In order to show higher dimensional data, some amount of interactivity needs to be added to the choropleth map. Additional information can be added via tooltip, interactive elements that allow the user to change which variables is represented, etc.\n\nThis is not the most effective visualization for showing change over time. Other visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, etc. are better at showing change over time. However, if you want to show a snapshot in time, a choropleth map is great because the viewer can see patterns in which regions have more or less vaccinations.\n\n\n##### Example Choropleth Map","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(\"../input/github-repository/download.png\")","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"___\n### Folium [Visualization Package]\n\n[Folium Documentation](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)\n\nFolium is an open source Python library that specializes in geospatial data visualization. It is easy to install using either pip install or conda install in your Python environment.\n\nIn general, it is a declarative programming package. Folium has many built in classes (eg. Choropleth() used below) that help the user explain what features should be included on the map without having to tell Folium exactly how to plot the Polygon objects. This being said, Folium itself is somewhat limited in how much a map can be customized. However, it integrates with other packages like brewer (for color map creation) and Vega/VegaLite (for additional annotations on the plot). This allows for more customization, outside of Folium's limitations.\n\nFolium has a built-in class specifically for Choropleth maps. This class makes it very easy to specify which values should be included on the map without having to do too much overhead data manipulation. I also considered, Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Plotly. I decided on Folium because it seemed to have the most straight-forward process for creating choropleth maps. Further, I have used Matplotlib, Bokeh and Plotly in the past so I wanted to branch my learning into a new area.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"___\n### Creating my own Choropleth Map [Demonstration]","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Geopandas allows for geospatial data structures.

It appears that most \"gray\" countries are in under-developed countries. The downfall with this dataset is that we don't know whether these countries don't have vaccines or have not published the number of vaccines available in publically available online form.\n\nIt's also important to note why some countries (like Israel) have over 100 vaccines per 100 people. On the surface, this may seem like a data issue, however this is because many of the vaccines require two doses. In this case, they need 200 vaccines/100 people to be complete.\n\n\n#### Conclusions\nFolium is great for building Choropleth maps. It makes it very easy to overlay the shapes onto an existing map. However, if you want to customize further, it's going to require expertise on different Python packages like Altair or even some HTML.","metadata":{}}]}

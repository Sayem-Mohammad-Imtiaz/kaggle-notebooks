It is the world's largest music streaming service provider, with over 356 million monthly active users, including 158 million paying subscribers, as of March 2021.\n\nSpotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded music and podcasts, including more than 70 million songs, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.\n\nSpotify is available in most of Europe and the Americas, Oceania and more than 40 countries in Africa as of July 2021 (including South Africa and Mauritius) and Asia. By the end of 2021, Spotify is expected to operate in a total of 178 countries. The service is available on most modern devices including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers, iOS and Android smartphones and tablets and AI enabled smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Home.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**About the project:** This project is a part of course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) provided by [Jovian](https://jovian.ai).

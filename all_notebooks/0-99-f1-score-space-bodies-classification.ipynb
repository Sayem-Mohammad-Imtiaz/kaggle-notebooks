It is the most detailed three-dimensional map of the universe ever made, with multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. Data are available at its website and can be accessed via <i>SQL</i> query [1][sdss] [2][sdss_wiki].\n\nData used in this project are results from a query which joins two tables: <i>PhotoObj</i>, which contains photometric data, and <i>SpecObj</i>, which contains spectral data. Data can be retrieved using SkyServer SQL Search with the command provided in the project description. This query does a table JOIN between the imaging (PhotoObj) and spectra (SpecObj) tables and includes the necessary columns in the SELECT to upload the results to the SAS (Science Archive Server) for FITS file retrieval [3][kaggle]. \n\n[sdss]: www.sdss.org\n[sdss_wiki]: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey\n[kaggle]: www.kaggle.com/muhakabartay/sloan-digital-sky-survey-dr16"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data loading\n\nLets' first set up libraries and load data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sb\nimport numpy as np\nimport xgboost\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/sloan-digital-sky-survey-dr16/Skyserver_12_30_2019 4_49_58 PM.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that there are many physical features that will probably be used for classification, but also some features concerning the process of acquisition which might be discarded.\n\nLet's first do some renaming, as a matter of personal preference."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.rename(columns={'ra': 'r_ascension', 'dec': 'declination', 'u': 'u_band',\n                        'g': 'g_band', 'r': 'r_band', 'i': 'i_band', 'z': 'z_band',\n                        'camcol': 'camera_col', 'class': 'label'})\n\ndf = df.replace(to_replace=\"QSO\", value=\"QUASAR\")\n\nprint(df.label.value_counts())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It can be noticed that there are two different id columns due to the <i>join</i> operation to create this table."},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Distinct objid: %d\" %len(df.objid.unique()))\nprint(\"Distinct specobjid: %d\" %len(df.specobjid.unique()))\n\ndf = df.drop(columns=[\"objid\", \"specobjid\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some IDs in the first table are not distinct whereas IDs in the second are all unique.

All in all, I would guess that <i>r_ascension</i> and <i>declination</i> will not be very significant in classification, <i>band</i> features will be more important especially to discriminate <i>quasar</i> and <i>not quasar</i>, and lastly <i>redshift</i> will be the most significative one. This is also logical since those two features are not related to physical properties but rather to their location in the sky vault.\n\nTalking about acquisition features, they all pretty much shows the same pattern accross all of the classes except <i>mjd</i> which is the acquisition date that doesn't have any logical meaning in classification. In addition, <i>rerun</i> raised some warnings saying that data must have a variance, meaning that it shows the same value throughout the samples. All in all, even if some of these features may have some correlation I'm not going to keep them because these are not physical properties and any classification ability is probably just due to statistical fluctuations.

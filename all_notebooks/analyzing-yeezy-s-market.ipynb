Even with some high prices, they sell almost 3x than Off-Whites, which probably has less products in stock when it releases in retail. \n\nAfter that, I constructed a model to predict the price of the yeezy sneakers. It performed good, as I expected it would be hard to predict the prices with a little number of variables, but I think that I used, in this model, the 3 more important: time passed since release, shoe size and the sneaker model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

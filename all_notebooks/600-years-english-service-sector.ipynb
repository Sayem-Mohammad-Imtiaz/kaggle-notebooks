Due to yearly outbreaks of plague and sickness the population stayed at about this number. There was a general shortage of labourers which meant wages were high and rents low. All classes therefore enjoyed a reasonable standard of living.\"\n\n\"The city of London had a population of around 60,000. It extended from Aldgate and the Tower of London in the east to Fleet Street and Temple Bar in the west. The village of Holborn was the northern extreme and the town of Southwark across the river marked the southernmost point. The only bridge across the river was London Bridge. St Paul’s Cathedral, on the top of Ludgate Hill, dominated the city. It was built in the Gothic style with a square Gothic tower.\"\n\n\"The streets of London were narrow and dirty and the upper floors of the timber houses often overhung the roads. If a fire broke out, large areas of the city could be destroyed. If this happened the community worked together to rebuild lost buildings. The roads were not paved and became bogs when it rained.\"\n\n\"Many of the inhabitants of London knew each other because the houses were packed so closely together. Noblemen, bishops and leading merchants all kept large establishments in the city. The church owned houses, tenements and plots of land all over the city.

To build a wattle and daub house, the builder had to construct a large timber frame. The spaces between the timbers were then filled with woven twigs called wattle. The twigs were then covered with a mixture of mud and clay known as daub which was left to bake hard. The wooden timber was coated with black tar to help preserve it and prevent it rotting. The daub was often painted with limewash to make it look whiter. The roof was then tiled.

At the end of the Elizabethan age, England is a major economic power, with London as its bustling cultural hub.\n\n\"Shortly after the accession of the first Stuart monarchs, the political and financial strength of the kingdom wavers. The Stuarts’ rule by the Divine Right of Kings undermines the authority of subjects represented by Parliament, and their Catholic sympathies stir a new wave of religious unrest. These tensions culminate in the outbreak of civil war in 1642, the trial and execution of King Charles I (r. 1625–49), and a decade of Puritan rule.\"\n\n\"The eighteenth century is marked by even more far-reaching changes. Revolutions rage against absolute monarchy in France and British rule in America; they manifest a belief in the authority of the individual and the assertion of human reason over doctrine. This philosophy, which takes root throughout Western and Central Europe, influences nearly every aspect of the political and cultural life of the age, known as the Enlightenment, or the Age of Reason. At the end of the century, emotionalism and the senses take precedence over order and law as the Romantic movement in the arts and literature gains momentum.\"\n\n\"The Puritan-led Commonwealth of 1649–60, an outbreak of plague in 1665, and the Great Fire of 1666 virtually still the artistic production of the region. In the wake of these catastrophic events, however, a generation of native-born artists plants the seeds of a distinctly British school of painting and architecture.\"\n\nhttps://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/09/euwb.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://slidetodoc.com/presentation_image/5f598a4b30c4cd916630e52ecab44e46/image-6.jpg)slidetodoc.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.line(df, x=\"Year\", y=\"Financial_Services\", color_discrete_sequence=['#000080'], \n              title=\"Financial Services 1270-1870\")\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Outbreak of The Great Plague of London in 1665</span>**\n\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTU2URy4U2jbyUGp76Bg_wWco5udm1JLI9LNQ&usqp=CAU)tes.com.

Most carts and wagons had spiked wheels and blacksmiths usually set up their forges near the roads and made a good trade shoeing horses and repairing wheels. Travel was most hazardous in the winter months when rain or snow could obliterate the dirt tracks. Villages were few and far between and signposts a rarity. Travellers venturing into unknown areas would often employ a guide. People tended to travel in groups whenever possible for protection against being robbed by highwaymen.\" \n\n\"In London, many rich people travelled on the River Thames. Wherries and rowing boats were able to be hired from river steps and landing stages. Most boats sat two people and were made comfortable with cushions and awnings.

Cloth was mainly produced in Somerset, The Cotswolds, East Anglia and Yorkshire. Clothiers from these areas travelled to the capital with their laden pack horses. They unloaded their wares in Blackwell Hall, Basinghill Street where the bales were sealed and weighed by market officials. The buyers had a monopoly for buying cloth and although clothmakers haggled prices were generally low. In a bid to make more money, many wealthy merchants bought their own country estates and filled the land with sheep so that they could control every stage in the manufacture of the cloth.\"\n\n\"The increase in the Wool trade with Burgundy meant that the demand for wool had increased.

In learning up python for Data Science, I came across Kaggle and found this dataset on diversity, which really hits close to home as I worked a lot with Inclusive Excellence and Diversity in my undergrad work. I was really interested in how the breakdown looks for these top tech companies. Note that this data is from 2016, though it would be nice to have data from other years to see if there's any shift in any one demographic.\n\nI decided to use Plotly as my visualization library for Python as they're interactive and the user can modify what they would like to see. Utilize the legend to show/hide any part of the data to your liking.\n\nThis is still a work in progress and I want to add more analysis on male vs. female, by job category, and more!"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Interactive Data Visualization with plotly\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"353046c377259aa2381e4792e797b9220ef3616b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To take a quick look at this DataFrame, there are six columns in this dataset:\n\n**company**: Company name\n\n**year**: For now, 2016 only\n\n**race**: Possible values: \"American_Indian_Alaskan_Native\", \"Asian\", \"Black_or_African_American\", \"Latino\", \"Native_Hawaiian_or_Pacific_Islander\", \"Two_or_more_races\", \"White\", \"Overall_totals\"\n\n**gender**: Possible values: \"male\", \"female\".

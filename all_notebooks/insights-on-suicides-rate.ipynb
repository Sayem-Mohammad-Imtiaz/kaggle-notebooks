The reason for such is because Generation X people are mostly older than 54 years by now, and as we've seen, between 35 and 54 years is when most suidides happen. That is to say, most of Generation X got through the Critical Range already, so it's unlikely that the X Generation will become the second generation with most suicides, surpassing the Silent generation.\n \n However, notice that Millenials did **not** go through the Critical Range, and yet, they are the fourth most suicidal generation already. This suggests that it's likely Millenials, with their fame as the Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide Generation, might become one of the generations with most suicides. \n \n Alternatively, we might suggest that Millenials might have a earlier Critical Range. By doing so, it's possible to believe that older Millenials will not have greater suicidal tendencies when compared to younger ones, but we also might be left thinking if Generation Z will have a still earlier Critical Range.\n \n  What I'm trying to point out here is that a first analysis of the data might suggest that suicide rates are dwindling recently, but it might be too early to ignore suicide as a significant problem in today's world.\n  \n  Finally, there's a mild suggestion that in Brazil's sample younger generations have slightly higher suicidal tendencies, at least when comparing to the world data.

I'm pointing this out mostly because it might be an explanation as to why for people with more than 75 years old there's a lot less difference in the suicide rate.

I personally loved the first season, but I can understand it would require some getting used to realize that The Office is not - 'OMG Hahaha', but rather - 'Ummm...that is hilarious but I'm not sure if I should laugh'\n    - Also, season 1 only had 6 episodes, thus serves as a way for the writers to just see how the audience react and based on those responses, they could adapt and modify characters in the subsequent seasons. Also, season 1 could also be served as the gateway to all the seasons, new viewers would try The Office based on some recommendation and then might end up finding things not what they expected, while not realizing the other seasons are much much more enjoyable. \n- The show was at its peak rating at Season 3 and after that there is a steady decline up until Season 5, Season 6 was a sharp dip, which was recovered in Season 7. As an Office fan, I tend to ignore the existence of Season 8. Season 9 was pretty good for most parts. \n- The Average Duration of episodes has also changed across seasons. Season 3 which has the highest Rating has an average episode duration of 25 mins, while Season 4 has the highest average episode duration of 32.5 mins.

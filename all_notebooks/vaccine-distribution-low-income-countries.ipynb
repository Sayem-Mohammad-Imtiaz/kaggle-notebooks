Relevant Players. Third Parties. Timing. Observability of Moves.</font></mark></b>\n\nIn a game theory analysis, researchers first identify the strategic ecosystem of interest (in this case, the landscape of COVID-19 vaccine development, manufacturing and deployment); the relevant players and their objectives; players’ strategic options; third parties capable of changing the game; and other factors such as the timing and observability of moves.\n\nThe game we focused on is the current situation in which there are currently multiple vaccine candidates, yet no certainty as to which ones will be the safest and most effective. In this context, there are many players whose choices impact one another:\n\nSelf-financing countries, deciding whether or not to participate in COVAX and/or to make bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers.\n\nVaccine manufacturers, deciding whether (and when) to agree to commit capacity through COVAX and/or to make bilateral deals with countries.\n\nGavi and other global health institutions capable of influencing the ‘rules of the game’ directly (eg, through the specific rules of COVAX) and indirectly (eg, by articulating principles and facilitating collective action).\nhttps://gh.bmj.com/content/5/11/e003627"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['Developer_Researcher'].value_counts().head(10).plot.barh(figsize=(16, 8), color='green')\nax.set_title('Vaccine Developer Researcher', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('Developer Researcher', size=10)\nax.set_xlabel('count', size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"content(\n    \"Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes \" +\n    \"in the freedom of the commons.

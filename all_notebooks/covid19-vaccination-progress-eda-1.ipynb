We'll call this the 'balanced' group.\n- Cluster 1 consists of countries that use a mix of Oxford/AstraZeneca (associated with the western Europe) and vaccines produced by the 'East' (China or Russia) such as Sinopharm, Sinovac and Sputnik or India's case, its own vaccine, Covaxin. Using cheaper vaccines produced from both political sides, these countries can be generally seen as 'budget, politically unbiased'.\n- Cluster 2 consists of several countries that are traditionally viewed as being part of the 'communist' block during the cold war era. These countries do not use the vaccines produced by the 'West' and rely on a mix of vaccines from the East or domestically produced vaccines in the case of Cuba. For the purposes of this notebook, I'll label them as 'budget, politically biased'.\n- At first glance, Cluster 3 seems to consist of countries that predominantly use American vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNTech. However, some countries that also use Sinovac/Sinopharm such as Turkey and Hong Kong and Macao appear in this cluster. It is interesting that Hong Kong and Macao use Pfizer even though they are autonomous territories of China, which is not on the best diplomatic ties with the United States. These territories may use Pfizer because the citizens in these territories likely trust the US vaccines even though their governments aren't diplomatic terms. This reveals that perhaps citizen trust is just as important as diplomatic ties, when it comes to vaccine selection. Overall this is quite a hodgepodge group and splitting it up could lead to more meaningful clusters. However, based on the current cluster split, the common trait amongst members is that these they use Pfizer, but not Oxford/AstraZeneca.\n\n\nOverall, it seems that politics could have some influence on how vaccines decide which vaccines to use.\n\nNote: These generalisations may not apply to all countries within the group perfectly. Clusterings are almost never perfect and it would be virutally impossible to describe the countries within each group with a short label. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Further Plots of Clusters","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.scatter_geo(df[1:], locations=\"Country\", locationmode=\"country names\",\n                     color=\"Cluster\",\n                     size=\"Size\",\n                     size_max=50\n                     )\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-28T15:22:43.109244Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-28T15:22:43.109611Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-28T15:22:43.179658Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-28T15:22:43.109579Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-28T15:22:43.178667Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.box(df[1:], x=\"Cluster\", y=\"GDP\", hover_name=\"Country\", color=\"Cluster\", points=\"all\")\nfig.update_xaxes(\n        tickangle = 90,\n        title_text = \"Cluster\",\n        title_standoff = 25,\n        categoryorder =\"median descending\")\n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-28T15:22:46.026523Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-28T15:22:46.026892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-28T15:22:46.117043Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-28T15:22:46.026861Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-28T15:22:46.116153Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The GDP per capita of Cluster 0 and 3 are much higher than those of the 'budget' clusters 1 and 2. \n\nLet's see how vaccination progress is reflected by vaccination progress.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.box(df[1:], x=\"Cluster\", y=\"Doses per 1000\", hover_name=\"Country\", color=\"Cluster\", points=\"all\")\nfig.update_xaxes(\n        tickangle = 90,\n        title_text = \"Cluster\",\n        title_standoff = 25,\n        categoryorder =\"median descending\")\n\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-28T15:22:49.790639Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-28T15:22:49.791287Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-28T15:22:49.879976Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-28T15:22:49.791246Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-28T15:22:49.879229Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Vaccination progress for each cluster seems to follow a similar trend as GDP.\n\nHowever, interestingly, although the median GDP per capita of cluster 0 is lower than that of cluster 3, cluster 0 has a similar median vaccination progress.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\nOverall it seems that the following factors could influence vaccination progress:\n- Economics (GDP) is a strong predictor of vaccination progress.\n- Vaccine choice (some colinearity with GDP)\n- Potentially politics (potentially influences vaccine choice: can consider both citizen trust and diplomatic relationships). Not enough analysis or data to conclude on the degree of impact. Would be good if an external dataset of political closeness between countries could be used to validate this. \n\nFactors that do not contribute meaningfully to vaccine progress:\n- Size (on it's own)\n- Geography (Although it is a good indicator on its own, it has a colinear impact alongside Economics and Politics, which seem to be more logical proxies) \n\nOther factors to consider:\n- Logistics (Country Land Size, Land-locked)\n- Health policies\n- Covid cases (if a country has several covid cases and/or deaths, perhaps they would be more inclined to vaccinate quickly)\n- Economics (Industry). Countries and territories that are dependent on tourism may be more inclined to vaccinate quickly.\n\n# Limitations with data and analysis\n- No breakdown of number of vaccine doses for each specific vaccine brand\n- Limited usage on statistics of each individual vaccine (e.g. cost, country of origin, trust)\n- Time series data for vaccination progress is too limited for meaningful insight\n- Would be meaningful to have vaccination and death time series data to develop better insight on how vaccination rates are helping against covid\n\n# Future works\n- Feature engineering using economical and political features. \n- The clustering from the vaccine types could be used as a basic proxy feature for political alignment but there are likely to be more robust datasets that can be used for feature engineering this attribute.\n- Time series to track deaths and vaccination progress. \n- Could use more traits related to countries such as proxies of their healthcare/political policies. \n- Could represent each vaccine as a vector of traits. e.g. trust (academic trust and political trust), safety (associated with acadamic trust), cost, availability\n\nThis is just a preliminary exploratory data analysis and there is a lot more to explore. \n\nHopefully this kernel has been of help to you.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Thank you!","metadata":{}}]}

Analysis \n* Comparing the newest building to the oldest building (Mouse_health_Justin & Mouse_health_Estella): \n    * Both buildings use district heating \n    * Both buildings are used for healthcare\n    * The older building (Mouse_health_Estella) has less yearly electricity usage per m^2 when compared to the newer building (Mouse_health_Justin)\n    * But we should not be making this direct comparison because: \n        * As hospitals modernize and expand, there will be new technologies and machines that will require more electricity usage \n            * Electricity usage (excluding heating) accounts for a total of 21.46% of this sites total electricity usage in 2015\n            * We do not know the improvements the hospital made for each building. E.g. Possible that one building received more development than the other. \n    * We do not know the building material \n         * By looking at images, we see that Mouse_health_Justin has many more windows than Mouse_health_Estella. But new modern windows now contain more panes of glass providing better insulation. \n             * Doors and windows: the number, size and quality of doors and windows can influence heat lose up to 25% [[1]](https://www.hydroquebec.com/residential/customer-space/electricity-use/electricity-consumption-factors.html)\n         * Additionally, the insulation and buliding material used in each building is unknown. \n             * Thermal envelope: poorly insulated walls, foundations, roof spaces can cause up to lose of 40% of a building's heat\n         * These variables affect heating, which accounts for 78.5% of this site's electricity usage.

This is dependent on your batch size. The batch size is set where you initialize your training data. For example, if you're doing this with ImageDataGenerator.flow() or ImageDataGenerator.flow_from_directory(), the batch size is specified with the batch_size parameter in each of these.\n\nWith 3000 samples for example:\n\n```\nIf your batch size was 100, then steps_per_epoch would be 30.\nIf your batch size was 10, then steps_per_epoch would be 300.\nIf your batch size was 1, then steps_per_epoch would be 3000.\n```\n\nThis is because steps_per_epoch should be equivalent to the total number of samples divided by the batch size.

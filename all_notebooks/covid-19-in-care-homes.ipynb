Once we have any person infected we `isolate them in hospital for three months` and at the same time we `isolate all the close contact` people in a separate quarantine centre for `14 days for observation.`\n\n“They do tests regularly in that 14 days to make sure they don’t have the virus. We use a supercomputer to trace the close contacts of people being infected particularly for cluster outbreaks.”\nHe added that all nursing homes had a trained infection controller and underwent emergency drills simulating an infection outbreak four times a year so infection control becomes “a well-worn practice”. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/mps-hear-why-hong-kong-had-no-covid-19-care-home-deaths","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Distribution graphs (histogram/bar graph) of column data\ndef plotPerColumnDistribution(df, nGraphShown, nGraphPerRow):\n    nunique = df.nunique()\n    df = df[[col for col in df if nunique[col] > 1 and nunique[col] < 50]] # For displaying purposes, pick columns that have between 1 and 50 unique values\n    nRow, nCol = df.shape\n    columnNames = list(df)\n    nGraphRow = (nCol + nGraphPerRow - 1) / nGraphPerRow\n    plt.figure(num = None, figsize = (6 * nGraphPerRow, 8 * nGraphRow), dpi = 80, facecolor = 'w', edgecolor = 'k')\n    for i in range(min(nCol, nGraphShown)):\n        plt.subplot(nGraphRow, nGraphPerRow, i + 1)\n        columnDf = df.iloc[:, i]\n        if (not np.issubdtype(type(columnDf.iloc[0]), np.number)):\n            valueCounts = columnDf.value_counts()\n            valueCounts.plot.bar()\n        else:\n            columnDf.hist()\n        plt.ylabel('counts')\n        plt.xticks(rotation = 90)\n        plt.title(f'{columnNames[i]} (column {i})')\n    plt.tight_layout(pad = 1.0, w_pad = 1.0, h_pad = 1.0)\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One-Third of All U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Are Nursing Home Residents or Workers.

The virus so far has infected more than 153,000 at some 7,700 facilities. \n\nIn the absence of comprehensive data from some states and the federal government, The Times has been assembling its own database of coronavirus cases and deaths at long-term care facilities for older adults. These include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, memory care facilities, retirement and senior communities and rehabilitation facilities. \n\nSome states, including Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey and South Carolina, regularly release cumulative data on cases and deaths at specific facilities. California, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio, among others, provide some details on the number of cases — but not on deaths. Others report aggregate totals for their state but provide no information on where the infections or deaths have occurred. About a dozen report very little or nothing at all. \n\nGiven the wide variability in the type of information available, the totals shown here almost certainly represent an undercount of the true toll.

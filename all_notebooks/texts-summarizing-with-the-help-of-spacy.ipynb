Convert Paragraphs to Sentences\n> We first need to convert the whole paragraph into sentences. The most common way of converting paragraphs to sentences is to split the paragraph whenever a period is encountered. \n\n### 2. Text Preprocessing\n> After converting paragraph to sentences, we need to remove all the special characters, stop words and numbers from all the sentences. \n\n### 3. Tokenizing the Sentences\n> We need to tokenize all the sentences to get all the words that exist in the sentences\n\n### 4. Find Weighted Frequency of Occurrence\n> Next we need to find the weighted frequency of occurrences of all the words. We can find the weighted frequency of each word by dividing its frequency by the frequency of the most occurring word.\n\n### 5. Replace Words by Weighted Frequency in Original Sentences\n> The final step is to plug the weighted frequency in place of the corresponding words in original sentences and finding their sum. It is important to mention that weighted frequency for the words removed during preprocessing (stop words, punctuation, digits etc.) will be zero and therefore is not required to be added\n\n### 6. Sort Sentences in Descending Order of Sum\n> The final step is to sort the sentences in inverse order of their sum. The sentences with highest frequencies summarize the text.

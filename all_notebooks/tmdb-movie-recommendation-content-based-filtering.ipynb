Here is an exmaples: **Netflix show recommendation system**.\n\nSuppose Todd loves watching action movie, by using content based filtering, the system will recommend more action movies that Todd hasnt watached. In another cases, by using collaborative approach, the system will like other users like Desmond also watch the same action movie as Todd plus a horror movie, then the system will recommend Todd to watch that horror movie. \n\nDue to the limitation of collaborative filtering, it **requires users community and enough amount of data for computing**. Thus, it is more handy to use content based filtering.\n\nIn this case, i will showcase how to use content based filtering to building a recommender system in TMDB Movie Dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.getcwd()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.548232Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.548688Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.566196Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.548595Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.564896Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \ncredits= pd.read_csv('../input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_credits.csv')\nmovies = pd.read_csv('../input/tmdb-movie-metadata/tmdb_5000_movies.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.568711Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.569144Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.12557Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:51.569099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.12458Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"credits","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.126817Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.127137Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.145453Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.127102Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.144266Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# rename the common column name for merging two dataset later\nmovies.rename(columns={'id':'movie_id'},inplace=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.147202Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.147579Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.153127Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.147536Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.152182Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movies","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.154368Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.154725Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.195376Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.154686Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.194344Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Merge two datasets\nmovies_combine = pd.merge(movies,credits,on=['movie_id','title'])\nmovies_combine","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.196515Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.196791Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.265613Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.19676Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.26465Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movies_combine.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.266824Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.26716Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.289787Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.267092Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.288583Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Columns: Homepage and tagline have relatively high missing values, so we tend to drop these two columns","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"movies_combine.drop(['homepage','tagline'],axis=1,inplace=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.292239Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.292545Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.302499Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.292511Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T10:36:52.301381Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Content Based Filtering","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By looking at the description in the overview columns, we try to extract important keywords as features.

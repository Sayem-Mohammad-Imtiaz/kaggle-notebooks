"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I have been curious about the mortality rate for the coronavirus.  I know the official rate is the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. But I keep thinking that since people who are still sick may yet die, it seems like # deaths/# cases would be an underestimate of the true death rate -- someone who was just confirmed with the virus has awhile to go before they're safe. However, if you look at the number of deaths vs the number of recoveries, that is frightening close to even, though the number of recovered patients is growing much faster than the number of deaths.  So I wanted to play a bit with delays between the different variables.

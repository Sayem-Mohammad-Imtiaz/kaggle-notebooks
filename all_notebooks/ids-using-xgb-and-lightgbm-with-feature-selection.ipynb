It is a huge repository of community published data.\n  - Short description: The dataset consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It has 25192 rows & 42 columns.\n  - *Note: Just after loading the data, the data was split into 7:3 training and testing data to prevent data leakage.*\n\n2. **Data Analysis and Preparation:**\n  - Here, we analysed the data to find any discrepancies, interesting patterns, coorrelation in data, etc. This step is also popularly known as *Exploratory Data Analysis*.\n  - After analysing, we performed some standard data preprocessing techniques. It was done wherever we felt that it would affect our process.\n  - Most of our time was consumed during this process.\n  - Some methods used are:\n    - *Data cleaning* - handling missing values by mean imputation, etc.\n    - *Data Scaling and Normalisation* - Scaling or Normalisation is common preprocessing technique used in machine learning where the data is ususally normalised to a scale of 0 to 1.\n    - *Data Encoding* - Most of the models cannot process strings/objects. So the data needs to be transformed to numerical data. This process is known as data encoding(also data transformation).\n    - *Feature Selection* - Removing redundant features or selecting the most \"useful\" features. We used `recursive feature elimination` for feature selection.\n3. **Model Selection/Building:**\n  - Here, we choose the right models that can be used for the required task.\n  - Our task required us to use a *Classification model*.\n  - We selected 2 State of the art models - *LightGBM* and *XGBoost*.\n  - We also selected a few standard models to compare the results namely Logistic Regression, SVC, Naive Bayes.\n\n4. **Model Training:**\n  - The model was trained on the training data which took a few minutes for each model.\n\n5. **Model Evaluation**\n  - After the model is trained, we evaluate the performance of the model.\n  - The evaluation metrics used are: *Precision* and *Recall*.\n\n6. **Parameter Tuning**\n  - A model needs to be \"tuned\" for each particular scenario/ usecase based on the dataset.\n  - This includes changing various parameters and evaluating the results simulaneously.\n\n7. **Making Predictions**\n  - After the model parameters are finalized and it is trained, it can be saved and used for making predictions.","metadata":{"id":"IQJSKkrrfnUW","papermill":{"duration":0.026074,"end_time":"2021-04-15T05:33:57.182826","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-04-15T05:33:57.156752","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###

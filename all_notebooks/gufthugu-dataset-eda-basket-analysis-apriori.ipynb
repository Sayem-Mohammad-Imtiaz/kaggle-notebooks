It also applies and visualizes the apriori algorthm to obtain association rules from the dataset.\n\nThis notebook is split into 3 main parts:\n1. Data cleaning,\n2. Visualization & analysis,\n3. Market basket analysis (apriori algorithm).\n    \nThe analysis addresses the following questions:\n* What are the best selling books?\n* How does the number of orders vary by month?\n* Does the number of sales depend on the day of the week?\n    \nMore coming soon!

It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\"\n\\- Wikipedia, 2020\n\n## Useful Links:\nThe following resources were used as references for this section of the notebook:\n1.

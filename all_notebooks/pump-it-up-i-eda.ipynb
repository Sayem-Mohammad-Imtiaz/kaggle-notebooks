Outliers have y-values that are unusual in relation to other observations with similar x-values. Alternatively, plots of the residuals from fitted least square line of bivariate regression can also indicate outliers.\n\nThe consensus is that all outliers should be carefully examined:\n\nGo back to original data to check for recording or transcription errors\nIf no such errors, look carefully for unusual features of the individual unit to explain difference.

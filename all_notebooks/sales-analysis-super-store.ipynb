They sell Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology products and their customers are the mass Consumer, Corporate and Home Offices. The data set contains sales, profit and geographical information of individual orders. \n\nOur task is to determine weak areas and opportunities for Super Store to boost business growth.\n\n**Business Questions**\n\n- Which Category is Best Selling and Most Profitable?\n- What are the Best Selling and Most Profitable Sub-Category?\n- Which is the Top Selling Sub-Category?\n- Which Customer Segment is Most Profitable?\n- Which is the Preferred Ship Mode?\n- Which Region is the Most Profitable?\n- Which City has the Highest Number of Sales?\n\n**Who is Reading this Analysis?**\n\n- We assume that the Super Store is a family business and is owned by 1 or 2 owners who are very invested in their business. \n- Owners are likely not people who are expert in reading charts or interpreting statistical analysis, so our analysis will be in layman terms and easy to understand.\n- They needs information to make informed decisions on how to boost business profit so, our analysis focus on finding weaknesses or opportunities and providing recommendations and marketing strategies.\n\n---\n\n## Preparing the Environment\n\nWe will import the required libraries and read in the data set.\n\n- Pandas - Data manipulation\n- Matplotlib and Seaborn - Data visualisation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries and alias for easy reading\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.894982Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.895675Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.904678Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.895619Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.903465Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in data in CSV format\nsuperstore = pd.read_csv('../input/tsf-datasets/SampleSuperstore.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.906585Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.907299Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.951905Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.907215Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.950609Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Data Exploration\n\nLet's have a look at the data using df.head() and df.tail() function.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preview first 5 rows of data set\nsuperstore.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.977291Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.977673Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.998499Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.97764Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T05:32:13.997706Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preview last 5 rows of data set\nsuperstore.tail()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T05:32:14.04749Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T05:32:14.04801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T05:32:14.067661Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T05:32:14.047977Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T05:32:14.06681Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can easily tell that there is a mix of categorical, geographical and numerical variables. \n\nEach row represents an order of an item and the corresponding quantity, sales, discount and profit.

Bundle them with the less profitable products such as Bookcases, Table and Chairs to offset the losses.\n- Selling Bookcases and Tables result in huge losses, so Super Store has to consider to bundle them together with High Selling or Profitable sub-category such as Chairs, Copiers, Phones and Office Supplies products.\n- For Home Offices customers, these people might be busy with work and less likely to spend time selecting individual products, so create a Home Office package with products used for offices such as table, chairs, phone, copiers, storage, label, fasteners, bookcases.\n- For loss-making products like Supplies, Bookcases, Tables, consider to either drop these from the catalogue or change suppliers and bargain for cheaper price.\n- Consumer and Corporate Segment make up more than 70% of customerbase. Target them, especially customers from the East and West region in the Top 10 cities with Highest Sales by introducing special promotions and bundles for mass Consumer and Home Offices and send promotional emails or flyers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you.","metadata":{}}]}

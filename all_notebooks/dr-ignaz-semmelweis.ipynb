Meet Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis\n\n\nThis is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital.\nIf Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever:\nA deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth.\nHe is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. \nHe is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: \n    It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies.

The handwashing begins\nWhy is the proportion of deaths constantly so much higher in Clinic 1? Semmelweis saw the same pattern and was puzzled and distressed.

While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth, the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.\n\nSemmelweis started to suspect that something on the corpses, spread from the hands of the medical students, caused childbed fever. So in a desperate attempt to stop the high mortality rates, he decreed: Wash your hands!

The fate of Dr. Semmelweis\nSo handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. All in all, it would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.\n\nThe tragedy is that, despite the evidence, Semmelweis' theory — that childbed fever was caused by some \"substance\" (what we today know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses — was ridiculed by contemporary scientists. The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.\n\nOne reason for this was that statistics and statistical arguments were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. If he would have had access to the analysis we've just put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"****** doctors must wash her hands."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

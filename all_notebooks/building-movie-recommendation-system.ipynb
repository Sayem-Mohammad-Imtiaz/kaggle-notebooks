The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n\n\n\n\n\nContent Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item.

The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching.

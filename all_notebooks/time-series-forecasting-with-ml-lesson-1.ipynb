We will also generate some simple descriptive statistics to get an idea of the distribution of data points.\n\nThe Pandas library offers excellent functionality for loading data from .csv files.\n\nIn this lesson, we will load a standard time series dataset in Pandas and explore it. To follow along properly, you should have some knowledge of the pandas package, as well as basic knowledge of python.\n\nThis lesson uses a time series dataset of Female Births in California 1959 that was sourced from [datamarket.com](https://datamarket.com).\n\n*In the next lesson, we will cover using plotting libraries to visualize our time series data.*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ecbdf12cc64975ab71fcd8f3f385f9bcf0f2d0f4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.

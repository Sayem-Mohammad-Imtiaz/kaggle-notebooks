The World Happiness Report 2020 for the first time ranks cities around the world by their subjective well-being and digs more deeply into how the social, urban and natural environments combine to affect our happiness.\n\nIn July 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 65/309 'Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development' inviting member countries to measure the happiness of their people and to use the data to help guide public policy. On April 2, 2012, this was followed by the first UN High Level Meeting called Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, which was chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Kimoon and Prime Minister Jigme Thinley of Bhutan, a nation that adopted gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product as their main development indicator.\n\nDrawing international attention, the report outlined the state of world happiness, causes of happiness and misery, and policy implications highlighted by case studies. In 2013, the second World Happiness Report was issued, and since then has been issued on an annual basis with the exception of 2014. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. Each annual report is available to the public to download on the World Happiness Report website\n\n\n\n## METHODS AND PHILOSOPHY\n\nThe rankings of national happiness are based on a Cantril ladder survey. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the results with various life factors. In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, and other topics. \n\nEach report is organized by chapters that delve deeper into issues relating to happiness, including mental illness, the objective benefits of happiness, the importance of ethics, policy implications, and links with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) approach to measuring subjective well-being and other international and national efforts.\n\nhttps://worldhappiness.report","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"40a7086b-ca81-4865-9d6e-c62b92ddd4b8","_cell_guid":"404ff2a1-1cbd-43f1-a058-6d656edbbc6d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## FEATURES ANALYZED\n\n\n* **rank** : Rank in Happiness\n* **region** : Country and region\n* **score** : Happiness Score\n* **gdp** : GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people.\n* **support** : Social support means having friends and other people, including family, to turn to in times of need or crisis to give you a broader focus and positive self-image. Social support enhances quality of life and provides a buffer against adverse life events.\n* **life_exp** : Healthy Life Expectancy is the average number of years that a newborn can expect to live in

Around 640 million people currently live without electricity in Africa – 210 million of which are in fragile and conflict-affected countries.  Public debt levels and debt risk are rising, which might jeopardize debt sustainability in some countries; the availability of good jobs has not kept pace with the number of entrants in the labor force; fragility is costing the subcontinent a half of a percentage point of growth per year; and gender gaps persist and are keeping the continent from reaching its full growth and innovation potential. More than 416 million Africans still live in extreme poverty.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b9a04be5-62b8-49de-8af0-9aeb838c7192","_cell_guid":"341cd058-1edc-4617-9ffd-ca6c5bc98444","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Happiness GDP Across the World in 2019\n\nmap_plot = dict(type = 'choropleth', \n           locations = df_2019['region'],\n           locationmode = 'country names',\n           z = df_2019['gdp'], \n           text = df_2019['region'],\n          colorscale = 'rdylgn', reversescale = False)\nlayout = dict(title = 'Happiness GDP Across the World in 2019', \n             geo = dict(showframe = False, \n                       projection = {'type': 'equirectangular'}))\nchoromap = go.Figure(data = [map_plot], layout=layout)\niplot(choromap)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Studies have demonstrated that social isolation and loneliness are associated with a greater risk of poor mental health and poor cardiovascular health, as well as other health problems.

Moreover, the value of freedom can only be understood and appreciated by those who have a sense of the past and a highly developed understanding of human nature.

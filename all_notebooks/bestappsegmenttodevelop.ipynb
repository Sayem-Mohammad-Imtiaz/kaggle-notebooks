Such large universe would be impractical to analyse, since it would require too much time spent on data cleasing, and extra costs aquiring such dataset.\n\nThus, bearing in mind the statistics principle of sampling, we've opted for using two free datasets, one for each platform, still containing a good deal of apps, large enough to \n\nWe got this number using a free dataset which is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)\n\nThat dataset is organized in columns, and described as follows:\n\n| Column | Description |\n|---|---|\n|\"id\" | App ID |\n| \"track_name\" | App Name |\n| \"size_bytes\" | Size (in Bytes) |\n| \"currency\" | Currency Type |\n| \"price\" | Price amount |\n| \"rating_count_tot\" | User Rating counts (for all version) |\n| \"rating_count_ver\" | User Rating counts (for current version) |\n| \"user_rating\" | Average User Rating value (for all version) |\n| \"user_rating_ver\" | Average User Rating value (for current version) |\n| \"ver\" | Latest version code |\n| \"cont_rating\" | Content Rating |\n| \"prime_genre\" | Primary Genre |\n| \"sup_devices.num\" | Number of supporting devices |\n| \"ipadSc_urls.num\" | Number of screenshots showed for display |\n| \"lang.num\" | Number of supported languages |\n| \"vpp_lic\" | Vpp Device Based Licensing Enabled |\n\n\nFor Android the columns are quite self-explanatory:\n\n| Column |\n|---|\n|App|\n|Category|\n|Rating|\n|Reviews|\n|Size|\n|Installs|\n|Type|\n|Price|\n|Content Rating|\n|Genres|\n|Last Updated|\n|Current Ver|\n|Android Ver|\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**We will start exploring the datasets by importing a function called *reader*, from the **CSV library**, which means *comma separated values*, a general use format for importing datasheets and lists organized in columns and rows.

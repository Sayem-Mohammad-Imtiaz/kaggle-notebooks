It was scraped off using the libraries 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup'.\n\nI haven't set any specific goal for this analysis, the idea was just to explore the data and see what information I could get. Also, I tried to avoid computing statistics that are easily obtained in e-sports websites (team victory percentage, average k/d ratio per player, etc.) and instead focused on rankings and analysis with temporal aspects.\n\nThis is my first public kernel, so don't hesitate in giving me corrections and suggestions.\n\nLet's get started!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Game"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This section is copied from the Dataset description.\n\nCounter-Strike Global Offensive is a game released in 2012, as a sequel to Counter-Strike Source (released in 2004), which is itself a sequel to the original Counter-Strike (released in 2000). The game's longevity is primarily caused by its competitive approach and vibrant professional scene. This longevity has shown in numbers recently, as CS:GO reached in March its all-time high concurrent weekly players (1.1M players), making it the most played game on Steam, 7 years after it was launched.\n\nThe game retains the same gameplay concepts since its first version, which include a Terrorist side (T) that is tasked to plant a bomb and have it detonate, and a Counter-Terrorist side (CT) that is tasked to defuse the bomb or prevent it from being planted. Both teams can also win a round by eliminating all players on the opposing team before the bomb is planted.\n\nA standard game of Counter-Strike is a best of 30 rounds, the winning team being the first to win 16 rounds. The 30 rounds are played in two halves of 15 on each side of the map, with a round time limit of 1 minute 55 seconds, plus 40 seconds after the bomb is planted.\n\nIn case both teams draw at the 30th round on 15x15, 6 more rounds are added-on, which constitutes overtime. The overtime ends if a team wins 4 out of 6 rounds. If both teams win 3 rounds in overtime, another overtime of 6 rounds is played, and the process might repeat indefinitely until one team wins it.\n\nThere are 7 maps in the map pool that are available to be played competitively at any given time. Maps are removed and added frequently for updates and revamps, as to not make the game stale. Matches are normally played as a 'bo3' (Best of 3) maps, with less important matches played in a 'bo1' fashion and finals often played as 'bo5's.\n\nThere is a money management side to rounds in Counter-Strike. This side is detailed in the 'Economy DataFrame' topic."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparation"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing libraries and loading the tables."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom os import listdir\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns',100)\n\nlistdir('../input/csgo-professional-matches/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"base_dir = '../input/csgo-professional-matches/'\n\nresults_df = pd.read_csv(base_dir+'results.csv',low_memory=False)\npicks_df = pd.read_csv(base_dir+'picks.csv',low_memory=False)\neconomy_df = pd.read_csv(base_dir+'economy.csv',low_memory=False)\nplayers_df = pd.read_csv(base_dir+'players.csv',low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first rows of each table are presented below.

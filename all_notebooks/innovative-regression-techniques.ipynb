However many of us did no know that there is might be other more efficient Algorithms in this regard. \n\nAlgorithms such as KNN, Descision Tress, and Gradient Boosting are very famous for their usage in classification problems. But, it turns out that they can do a very good job in regression problems. In this notebook we will show case the usage of these algorithms and evaluate their performance.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2 style=\"background-color:#f15a39; padding: 20px; font-family:cursive\">Outline</h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

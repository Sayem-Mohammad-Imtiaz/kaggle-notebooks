{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Divvy Bicycle Sharing Weather Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook we'll be exploring the effect of weather on bicycle sharing volume as provided by Divvy. The data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yingwurenjian/chicago-divvy-bicycle-sharing-data). \n\nThe analysis approach is as follows:\n- **Preparation:** ensuring there are no missing values and that we're familiar with the data that is presented and their representations.\n\n\n- **Data Manipulation:**\n    1. Create summarized views of the data at reasonable granularities, which were daily and hourly\n    2. Add in flags for special events such as weekends, holidays, and holiday weekends\n    \n    \n- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** quick views of the data to see general trends on both average trip time and trip counts; get a sense of some of the major correlations, especially for weather variables\n\n\n- **Decomposing Trend / Seasonality:** this is done to try and remove the seasonality and trend components from the time series to isolate the residuals which could then be modeled with just the weather variables\n\n\n- **Regression Analysis:** linear regressions are run on both un-decomposed data (with dummies for time variables) and the decomposed data; results are then compiled and summarized for the weather variables\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- **Warm Temperature:** \n    - Bike volume tend to increase when it's quite warm (between 60 and 80 degrees); however, as temperature increases beyond 80, the volume drops off as it's perhaps too hot out to be biking; the optimal range is about 70-80 degrees\n    - Average trip duration increases with temperature as well; it has very high correlation with trip count and duration (~50% for both)\n    - Temperature is also correlated to the number of months / annual seasonality which is why in the regression analysis it was important to separate out the effect of seasonality to get a sense of how important is temperature in excess of what is expected at that time of the year\n    \n    \n- **Weather Events:** Cloudy days sees the most disproportionately high number of trips (80% of the time it's cloudy yet 85% of trips are on cloudy days); clear and snow / rain sees a disproportionately low number of trips; weather events doesn't have a material effect on trip duration except for snow / rain which decreases the average ride time by up to a minute. \n\n\n- **Weekend vs. Weekdays:** weekdays show a high amount of volume for commuters and the daily ride volume is about ~40% on weekdays than on weekends. Also the rides on weekdays are more concentrated around rush hour (9am and 6pm). However, the average ride times are higher on the weekends as they are more likely for leisure. \n\n\n- **Regression Coefficients** are summarized in the table below; they only include coefficients that were tested to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). There are two levels to the columns: 1) the data_type which specifies whether the original (un-decomposed) data was used or the residuals from the trend/seasonality decomposition; and 2) which specifies whether the data was aggregated at the daily level or the hourly level. Some interesting insights from here are:\n    - Generally weather events do not have a huge impact on average duration, however we do see that in rain or snow, the trip lengths decrease about 0.5-1min on average; similar story for temperature - hotter -> longer rides but not by much\n    - For trip counts we do see generally thunderstorms have the biggest impact on rental volume (decrease of 100+ rentals per hour) whereas the other events are similar but there isn't a clear ordering or significance\n    - The residuals showed much fewer weather variables of significance than the original data (with dummies); this is likely because the decomposition algorithm captures a lot of the weather patterns as part of the cyclicality and so the leftover variance is difficult to be explained by weather -- it could only be explained by unexpected weather events"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# pivot_results","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Analyses\nIt would be interesting to see how much the effect of weather differs by the time of year and types of days. For example, it could be that an unexpected weather event on a weekend holiday would be much more detrimental to trip volume than an unexpected event during a winter weekday. To test that, we could separate the data by the type of day or into months and run similar cuts and regression analyses to see the weather impact."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n0.

temperature histogram shows that bike volume tend to increase when it's quite warm (between 60 and 80 degrees); however, as temperature increases beyond 80, the volume drops off since it's perhaps too hot out to be biking\n- **Monthly Seasonality:** The summer months seem to be the most popular time for bike rentals, which corroborates the finding above, which is that warmer temperatures correspond to higher volumes\n- **Hourly Seasonality:** The most popular times for bike rental occur around 9am and 5pm, which is rush hour for commuters\n- **Weekdays vs. Weekends:** Surprisingly, the weekday volumes look to be higher per day than the weekend volumes; this might be because a lot of bicycle renters are using them for commuting (more than the incremental volume that comes from leisure on the weekends)\n- **Location Concetration:** The vast majority of the rental activity is within a narrow range of longitude and latitude coordinates\n- **Short Rides:** The majority of the rides are fairly

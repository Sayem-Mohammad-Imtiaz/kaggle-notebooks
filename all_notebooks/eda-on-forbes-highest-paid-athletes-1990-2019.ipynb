The list has been compiled by Forbes Magazing and shows the highest earning athletes for the period of 1990 - 2019. Given the time span, the information extractable from this list can show us which athletes have managed to sustain their career longetivity rather than burning fast and dying out early. It will also give us insight into which athletes are benefiting the most from their sporting skill as well as their ability to pull endorsements from big-name companies in order to boost their overall earnings. \n\nAs you go through this EDA, the name of legendary basketball player, Kobe Bryant will feature more than once. Kobe was and still remains one of the best players to grace the game of basketball. May his legacy live on as a result of more than just his earnings but also his sheer greatness, discipline, dedication to his sport and athleticism. \n\n**Rest in Power, Kobe and Gina.**\n\n![Kobe_Gina](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2020-01/26/23/asset/dfdc5f88d1c3/sub-buzz-2438-1580080422-1.jpg?downsize=800:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as tk\n\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom IPython.display import HTML","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '../input/forbes-highest-paid-athletes-19902019/'\ndf = pd.read_csv(path+'Forbes Richest Atheletes (Forbes Richest Athletes 1990-2019).csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As is customary for an exploratory data analysis, we get a preview of the table and get basic statistics on it.

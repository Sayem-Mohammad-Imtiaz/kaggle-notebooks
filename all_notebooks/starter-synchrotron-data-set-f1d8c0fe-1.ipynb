Introducing a Surface Area Data Analysis by the first and the last history maker\nHi There~ \nThis is a great step to learn Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence. Some may not feel good enough to see difference b/t Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. So here I'm. Let's say you have obserbance in numbers just feel any characters you want to describe or analyze in a numerical data that can have computers understood. The numberical data just is needed in matrix. That matrix from, you can start to add characters on your data by vectorizing. You might not seem to know what's going on or what the hack is it? In a few chapters along, you will see a spectrometer signal - how to be undertaken into data visualizaiton. And you will teach the machine to get better from what they don't figure out on the way. We will learn functions and create/develop algorithm to let them figure out faster and be predicted itself. This is how we stand for AI beyond Machine Learning. If this storytelling explanation is not comfortable, just add a comment you would like to approach in a little differet way. We are all different~! Absolutley \\ ^^ /"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's start it \nBefore we begin a journey of Sruface Area Prediction. Keep in mind that we need to share a few disciplines we should circle around.\n* continuesly use your muscle : your wheel! You don't need to be a transformer that let people could understand better. However, it might cause to get them away from the main focus. So be sure on your core. Your story is not ended yet. And your audience could have more background knowledge before coming to you. \n* use, use it: a method was worked out well. Then add on. Never leave out to jump on a new brand. \n* for a while, you take: along the journey, you will learned, become a self-taught persons, stronger to lead your research to the next ground !!

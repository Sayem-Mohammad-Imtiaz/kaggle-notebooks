What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?\n\n**Race**\n\nWhile more than half of the workforce is made of white people, we've seen before that the jobs are more well distributed along underrepresented groups comparatively to official statistics in a national level. \n\n*Hispanics* get a slightly higher pay rate in average, whereas *American Indian or Alaska Natives* perform lower on that variable. Considering that these groups have only four members each, it is premature to conclude the divergence is caused by any discriminatory treatment.\n\n**Gender**\n\nThe workforce is predominantly female. Additionally, Dental Magic's CEO is a woman, and some more can be found in other high positions. These are positive, distinctive traits in a world that favors hiring male workers for most roles, especially leading ones.\n\nA potential highlight is how the company hires many women to work in *Production*, a department where labor is often manual.\n\nHowever, the company still faces some income inequality related to gender. The issue should be further investigated and dealt with.\n\n**Age**\n\nOnly 6.4% of the workers are 55 or older. This is certainly a diversity issue, specially looking at how 2018 data from the US BLS shows that 23.1% of the workforce in the country is in that age group (https://www.bls.gov/emp/graphics/2019/labor-force-share-by-age-group.htm).\n\n**The matter is specially precarious in the Software Engineering department and Admin Offices, that together count no more than a handful employees over *40*.**\n\n\n*Sales*, on the other hand, performs really well, having a good amount of well-paid elderly workers.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"Vn580wdp1e01"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Final thoughts \n\nDental Magic is a generally diverse company, though it still has some faults.\n\nThe biggest issue is the lack of age diversity, which is not truly promoted by any recruitment source.

However, the number of dead people by this virus in Germany is much smaller than any other EU countries. (The death ratio (='Daeth people'/'Confrimed people') in Germany is only 4%, whereas the death ratio in other EU countries is more than 10%.) \n \n So, why is the death ratio of people confirmed COVID-19 in Germany lower than any other EU countries??\n \n I guess that it is because  **speed of inspection system against COVID-19** in Germany.\n \n At first, Germany is the world's earliest and has expanded the testing system such as PCR testing to reduce the death rate to the lowest level among major EU countries.　In Germany, nearly 900,000 new coronavi tests can be performed per week.\n \n And Germany had more inspections early than other countries. By mid-February, PCR tests for COVID-19 were available at university hospitals across Germany despite being not implemented in most countries in the world.\n \n Finally,unlike Japan, German health authorities have taken the strategy of conducting PCR tests on as many citizens as possible and isolating infected and contact persons from their homes.　In Germany, nearly 900,000 PCR tests can be performed per week.\n \n I think that by these implementation the German government can control the death people.\n \n (Reference;https://business.nikkei.com/atcl/seminar/19/00023/060300171/?P=2\n https://www.afpbb.com/articles/-/3281152)\n \n ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

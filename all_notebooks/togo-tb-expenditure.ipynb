Pulmonary tuberculosis (38 cases) was the most common. TB-HIV co-infection was found in 14.9% of cases. Boys accounted for more than half of the patients. The age range of 11-15 years accounted for the highest proportion of cases (41.9%). The most common treatment was a combination of 2RHZE and 4RH (25 children, 33.8%). Laboratory monitoring was satisfactory. In all, 56 (75.7%) children were cured, and 14 (18.2%) lost to follow-up, while 3 (4%) died (all with TB/HIV).\n\n#Active testing for HIV infection is essential in children with TB, because the combination of the two can be lethal.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27694091/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://image1.slideserve.com/1892234/financement-du-secteur-de-la-sant-au-togo-exp-rience-des-programmes-sida-tb-paludisme-n.jpg)https://www.slideserve.com/denis/financement-du-secteur-de-la-sant-au-togo-exp-rience-des-programmes-sida-tb-paludisme","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Togo: Art against Covid-19\n\nTogolese artists paint the streets of the capital Lomé to make people aware of the prevention of the new coronavirus.

It has just stepped up the work underway in the context of the Regional Disease Surveillance Systems Enhancement (REDISSE) Project. The project will expand screening and patient care capacity by building the capacity of personnel involved in the response effort, strengthening the surveillance capacity of laboratories, and facilitating the procurement of personal protective equipment and medical equipment, including resuscitation equipment.\n\n“COVID-19 is placing a heavy burden on hospital and outpatient health services, which are on the front lines. The needs remain great, despite the work already done by the government and its partners.

sulfur dioxide was first ran only including pH, alcohol and sulphates resulting in a good visualisation of the dataset through t-SNE. After that I tried adding one more variable at the time until that adding one more feature made Elbow Plot change considerably, also, clusters behaved differently, showing crowding problems.\nThis tells us that if we add more features to our “new” dataset our information loses correlation, and make analysis more difficult to understand.\nIn Subset 1, we could see how clusters are formed according to the (High > 11.1%, or Low <= 11.1) percentage of alcohol in the Drinks.\nOur new dataset (\"subset 1\") with columns pH, alcohol, sulphates, chlorides and total sulphur dioxide can now be used to predict if our Drinks will have High or Low percentage of alcohol through a Supervised algorithm whre the target of course would be “alcohol”.\n\nSomething similar occurred with the Subset 2, which was composed with the columns alcohol, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar and chlorides. This one was analysed the same way adding features one by one until clusters started looking different. \nThe conclusion of the Subset 2 is quite similar to the conclusion of Subset 1; we obtained a new dataset that can now be used to predict the percentage of alcohol with a Supervised technique.\n\nAbout Subset 3, after analysing a few times with different features, parameters (perplexity, number of clusters, etc) and different techniques (PCA and t-SNE) I could not find any useful information. This tell us that working with unsupervised datasets will not always give us good results.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to reading your comments and recommendations!\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

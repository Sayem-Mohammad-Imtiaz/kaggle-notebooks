This is done by multiplying two metrics: how many times a word appears in a document, and the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents.\n\nIt has many uses, most importantly in automated text analysis, and is very useful for scoring words in machine learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n\nTF-IDF (**term frequency-inverse document frequency**) was invented for document search and information retrieval. It works by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in a document, but is offset by the number of documents that contain the word. So, words that are common in every document, such as this, what, and if, rank low even though they may appear many times, since they donâ€™t mean much to that document in particular.\n\nHowever, if the word Bug appears many times in a document, while not appearing many times in others, it probably means that itâ€™s very relevant. For example, if what weâ€™re doing is trying to find out which topics some NPS responses belong to, the word Bug would probably end up being tied to the topic Reliability, since most responses containing that word would be about that topic.\n\n### ***Math behind TF-IDF...***\n**TF-IDF** for a word in a document is calculated by multiplying two different metrics:\n\n- The **term frequency** of a word in a document. There are several ways of calculating this frequency, with the simplest being a raw count of instances a word appears in a document. Then, there are ways to adjust the frequency, by length of a document, or by the raw frequency of the most frequent word in a document.\n- The **inverse document frequency** of the word across a set of documents. This means, how common or rare a word is in the entire document set. The closer it is to 0, the more common a word is. This metric can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and calculating the logarithm.\n\nSo, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1.\nMultiplying these two numbers results in the **TF-IDF score** of a word in a document. The higher the score, the more relevant that word is in that particular document.\n\nTo put it in more formal mathematical terms, the TF-IDF score for the word `t` in the document `d` from the document set `D` is calculated as follows:\n\n![](https://monkeylearn.com/static/23b5e36265d19e9b42a9ae42220d257b/df264/1.png)\n\nWhere:\n\n![](https://monkeylearn.com/static/d96cda57105351e7b75b844910ab3f73/df264/2.png)\n\n![](https://monkeylearn.com/static/aaa7bf8149587b9b828f99e1db9f7e46/df264/3.png)\n\n*Source:* [*https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/*](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Without further ado, let's dive into the practical use-case of TF-IDF.**\n\n**We'll be extracting the top 10 keywords from the published papers in [NeurIPS Conferences](https://www.kaggle.com/rowhitswami/nips-papers-1987-2019-updated/) from 1987 to 2019 using built-in algorithm of TD-IDF in Scikit-learn library.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Code"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Printing data files\nimport pandas as pd #

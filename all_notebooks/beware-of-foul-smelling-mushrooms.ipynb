It includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. The field guide from which the mushroom records were drawn clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom, and it is common knowledge that if you are not able to identify a mushroom with confidence, you should not pick it. However, for experimentation purposes, we will study how well various machine learning models can predict whether a mushroom is poisonous or not given its physical characteristics. \n\nThere are 22 attributes, which are all categorical, and 8124 training instances. The goal is to predict the binary class 'poisonous' or 'edible'.

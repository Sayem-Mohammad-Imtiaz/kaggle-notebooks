Maybe the are getting good education and care so that they don't have to get into bad things to earn money.\n\n# What I realised from this data?\n**In most of the webseries/movies I watched, Black juveniles commits more crime as compared to White juveniles. But this data show that that's wrong. Also in these series and movies, they show heavy usage of drugs and selling of drugs, but suprisingly, juveniles arrested by drug related crimes are low as compared to Larency and Runaway. Which also changed my thought about US Juveniles.**\n\n# What do you think? Did I made any mistake?

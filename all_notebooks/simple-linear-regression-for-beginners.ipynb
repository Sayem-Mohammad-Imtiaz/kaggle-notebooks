Linear regression is a prediction method that is more than 200 years old. In this tutorial, you will discover how to implement the simple linear regression algorithm from scratch in Python.\n\nAfter completing this tutorial you will know:<br>\n&#9632; How to estimate statistical quantities from training data.<br>\n&#9632; How to estimate linear regression coefficients from data.<br>\n&#9632; How to make predictions using linear regression for new data.<br>\n\n\nLinear regression assumes a **linear or straight line relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).** More specifically, that output (y) can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (X). When there is a single input variable, the method is referred to as a simple linear regression.\n\nIn simple linear regression we can use statistics on the training data to estimate the coefficients required by the model to make predictions on new data.\n\nThe line for a simple linear regression model can be written as:\n\n$$ y = b_0 + b_1 * x $$\nwhere $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the coefficients we must estimate from the training data. Once the coefficients are known, we can use this equation to estimate output values for $y$ given new input examples of $x$. It requires that you calculate statistical properties from the data such as **mean, variance** and **covariance.**\n\n\nIf somehow this notebook helps you, please do <font color='red'> UPVOTE </font>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color = 'blue'> Swedish Insurance Dataset</font>\nWe will use a real dataset to demonstrate simple linear regression.

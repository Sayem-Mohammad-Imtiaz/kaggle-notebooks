{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Goals of this Script:\n\nThe goals of this script are to get an introduction to analysis of the covid 19 data in Europe. I want to see differences and changes over time in the number of confirmed cases, the number of active cases, the number of deaths, and the number of recoveries. Another thing I found was the total number of cases by country and compare them to see which has the most. Lastly, I found the percent makeup of confirmed cases, specifically the percentage of cases that were active, resulted in recoveries, and resulted in death. This is only a start and I always welcome suggestions. I am new to interactive visualizations and am learning, so please feel free to leave suggestions and feedback.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"eur_df_new = pd.read_csv('../input/covid19-cases-in-africa/covid19_europe.csv')\n#import europe Cases","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"eur_df_new.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"eur_df_new.shape\n#32138 records, 7 columns.

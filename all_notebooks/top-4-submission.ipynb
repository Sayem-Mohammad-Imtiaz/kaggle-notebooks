However, it is likely that following hyper-parameter tuning, a superior result can be achieved by dropping some outliers. Since dropping outliers on columns with importance >0.1, using a z score of 3 achieved the best result, that is what will be used. \n\nIt will only drop on outliers from area and height percentage, ensuring no important rows are dropped, and the original distribution between damage grades is maintained.

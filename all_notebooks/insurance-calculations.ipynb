This is especially costly (in terms of both money and reputation) in the modern day and age, where e commerce companies regularly ship out valuable goods to their paying customers.\n\nThrough the course of this notebook, I intend to showcase the potential for using logistic regression to save costs in an e commerce company by building a model to identify the parcels to apply for insurance for. \n\nIn this Hypothetical example, we managed to save **$457253.78** in insurance costs for 22,581 parcels.\n\n### Note:\n1. Insurance rates have been defined as **insurance_cost = max($20, 10% the cost of the order)** for this example.\n\n2. We are assuming that a random 5% of all parcels get stolen. Hence, we **calibrate the model** to account for this unbalance.\n\n3. Total reveune generated from the 22,581 parcels stands at **$6531261.43**\n\n**By : [Naimish Mani B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naimish-balaji-a6182b180/)**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introducton\n\nThere are 3 cases wherein the customer can claim to have not recieved a package they had paid for: \n\n1. Package was stolen from the customer before they could recieve it.\n2. Package was lost in transit.\n3. The customer is lying to get a refund.\n\nRegardless of the case, usually the company offers a refund to the customer. But at the end of the day, it amounts to revenue lost from the company's side. To minimise the losses from the company's end, the e commerce can opt to insure the packages that are being shipped out.\n\nBut again, insurance usually comes at a fixed cost. Hence, for young startups that have just started out and are struggling to maintain good cashflow, insuring all packages might not be feasible.

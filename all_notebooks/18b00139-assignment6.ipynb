This is because the government acted fast and closed the border strictly since the middle of March. Until now, New Zealand still closes its border to almost all non-citizens or residents. This is the main factor that make it be able to contain the virus. After the high numbers of daily cases in March, the number never exceed 40 people again. Most of the cases are also from managed isolation which makes it easy to control. Because the action is fast, the first spreader is always known and the quarantine is ordered for people involved in time. The covid-19 tests are also available and free.\n\nFor the vaccinations, the graph is like that because of the vaccination stages government has prepared. We can see that the number of vaccination rise at the start of May. This is because it is the time which the government started giving vaccines to people who are at risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 after already giving them to 'border and MIQ workers and the people they live with' and 'high-risk frontline workers and people living in high-risk places'.\n\nOne thing I observe from the ranking is that, using people vaccinated per hundred ranking, the ranking may not tell much informations. Most of the countries at the top are countries with small number of population. This makes it a lot easier for them to cover most of the populations. In my opinion, using this ranking is not fair for coutries with big popularity like New Zealand.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n\n- https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53274085\n- https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/412799/as-it-happened-covid-19-updates-in-nz-and-around-the-world-on-28-march\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_Zealand_(2021)\n- https://covid19.govt.nz/health-and-wellbeing/covid-19-testing/covid-19-testing/\n- ","metadata":{}}]}

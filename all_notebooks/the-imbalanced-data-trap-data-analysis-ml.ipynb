Introduction\n\npublicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.\n\nWe will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.\n\nA model that predicts whether a consumer will pay or not could help companies distribute its their resources better. If the companies have a borrower profile, they can, for example, allocate their best debt collectors to each case. They can also come up with paying strategies that could help the borrower pay the debt.\n\nIn this kernel, we are going to determine relevant factors that determine whether a borrower will pay a debt or not, then create a borrower profile and finally conlcude and make recommendations to better the business.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.1.

Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.\n- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.\n- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).\n- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.\n- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.\n- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).\n- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).\n- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n- pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

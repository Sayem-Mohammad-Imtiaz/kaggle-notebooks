However, it is sad that there are some that will try and game the system for their own good. But in a world where a single influencer's post is worth as much as an average 9-5 Joe's annual salary, influencer marketing fake followers and fake engagement is a price that brands shouldn't have to pay for.\n\n*Inspired by igaudit.io that was taken down by Facebook only recently.*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\n\nimport numpy as

Is that good enough? What about user Y with a 35% follower authenticity score and a 96% media likes authenticity?\n\nSince this entire notebook is an exploratory analysis, there's not really a hard line between a 'good' influencer and a 'bad' influencer. For user X, we can tell that the user has authentic and loyal followers. However for user Y, we can assume that they have a rather low authentic follower score, however their likes consist of real followers. This means that user Y might have invested on buying followers, but not likes! This causes a really low engagement rate.\n\nIn fact, with a little bit more research, you can sort of establish a pattern just by observation:\n- High follower authenticity, high media authenticity, high engagement rate = authentic user\n- Low follower authenticity, high media authenticity, low engagement rate = buys followers, does not buy likes\n- Low follower authenticity, high media authenticity, high engagement rate = buys followers AND likes\n- ... and so on!\n\n**So is this influencer worth investing or not?**\n\nRemember that we used a *random sample* of 50 followers out of thousands. As objective as random sampling could be, it still isn't an *absolutely complete* picture of the user's followers. However, the follower authenticity combined with the media likes authenticity still provides an insight for brands who are planning to invest on the influencer. \n\nPersonally, I feel like any number under 50% is rather suspicious, and there are other ways that you can confirm this suspicion:\n- Low engagement rates (engagement rate = average number of engagements (likes+comments) / number of followers)\n- Spikes in follower growth (uneven growth chart)\n- Comments (loyal followers acutally care about the user's content)\n\nBut of course, you have to be aware of tech-savvy influencers who cheats the audit system and try to avoid getting caught, such as influencers who buys 'drip-followers' - i.e. you buy followers in bulk but they arrive slowly. This method will make their follower growth seem gradual.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Conclusion**\n\nThe rapid growth of technology allows anyone with a computer to create bots to follow users and like media on any platform.

Less tech-savvy and less aware ones are prone to this kind of misinformation.\n\nFor brands who rely on influencers for marketing, it is highly recommended to check out services such as SocialBlade to check user authenticity and engagement.

I feel like BI tools (e.g Tabelau, Power BI, Qlik), would do much better job in that case.<br>\n\n**Target Variable** <br>\nWe need to look if our y (stroke classes) are imbalanced (Very likely case) <br>\n\n**Independent Variables** <br>\nIn our datasets we have couple of issues to address. First one are categorical features. We have to encode those. When we encode we need to pick encoding type (e.g One Hot or Ordinal) and we base our decision on the model we are going to train. If our model is sensitive to non standardized/normalized values in our data, then we have to deal with those too. <br>\nIn majority of problems like this Gradient boosting models are among the best in the field since they can deal with non-standardized data, categorical features, missing values and class imbalance. <br>\nSince it is not competition, I will not stack many models to get extremely accurate result. The library and model I pick is Microsoft LightGBM with its Gradient Boosting Machine Classifier.<br>\n\n### What is important to take into account is evaluation metric. What I saw in a lot of other works here on Kaggle,is that people that keep repeating the same mistake. They measure accuracy, precision, best case scenerio f1 score and it is just WRONG.<br>\n\nWhat you need to address is what you don't want to happen. We don't want to have people who might have a stroke to be predicted as healthy. So we want to see how our model is predicting Positive value, and we want to punish our score when model doesn't detect person that is positive. Which means that we want to go with Fbeta Score which is good metrics when cost of False Positive is smaller than False Negative in other words. <br>\n\n**If our patient goes onto list of potentially at risk of stroke without being at risk then not much will change for him/her. However for person that is at risk it is important to make sure that person has the best care and knows of his/her state and implement treatment.**<br>\n\n\n\nFor more information regarding Fbeta Metrics I highly encourage these sources.<br>\n[deep ai F2 Score](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/f-score) <br>\n[Sklearn Fbeta Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html)<br>\n\n\nApart from Fbeta, I suggest to also focus on Recall and Precision. We might have good recall and Fbeta but our model might not be precise (detect most of things as positive).\n\nGoing back to dataset as we can see below, we indeed work with imbalanced dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.DataFrame(data.groupby(\"stroke\").count()[\"id\"])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T07:30:13.031462Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-23T07:30:13.031843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T07:30:13.037724Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-23T07:30:13.031809Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-23T07:30:13.03652Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig1 = plt.figure(figsize=(16,5))\nsns.heatmap(data.isna().T)\nplt.title(\"Null Values\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T06:21:20.439069Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-23T06:21:20.439448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T06:21:21.810309Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-23T06:21:20.439416Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-23T06:21:21.809469Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So generally our model (Gradient Boosting Machines) can deal with null values, however I not know how it deals with those null values.<br>\nAs we can see we are missing BMI values for our patients and it might be beneficial to fill those values.

SUMMARY\n\nWe have build model using Gradient Boosting Classifier from Microsoft LightGBM.

For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.\n\nAll feature values are recoded with four significant digits.\n\nMissing attribute values: none\n\nClass distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# First we import the necessary libraries and functions"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we read in the data file"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data.csv')\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# We then split the features from the labels\n## We also drop a row full of NaNs"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = data.drop(columns = ['Unnamed: 32','diagnosis', 'id'])\nlabels = data[['diagnosis']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The original labels are strings, we must convert them to boolean values"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = labels.apply(lambda x: x=='M')\ny.head(20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# We split the data into training, validation, and testing sets"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train,X_eval,y_train, y_eval = train_test_split(X,y)\nX_eval, X_test, y_eval, y_test = train_test_split(X_eval,y_eval, test_size = .5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# We initialize the model"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = XGBClassifier(n_estimators = 1000, max_depth = 3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## We know train the model using our training and validations sets "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set =[(X_eval, y_eval)], early_stopping_rounds = 100, verbose = 10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# We predict labels for our test set and compare them to the actual labels\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we measure model accuracy"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"score = accuracy_score(y_test, test_predictions)\nprint( 'Accuracy: ', score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The model is able to distinguish between patients with bening and malignant cancers with a 97.22% accuracy!!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

This will tell us if their is a statistical difference between the mean spending score of men and women. The results can then be use to develop specific action plan on gender and per cluster.\n\nHypothesis:\n* H0: There is no difference between the mean spending score of Male and Women.\n* H1: There is a statistical difference between the mean spending score of Male and Women.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom scipy import stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importe dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/Mall_Customers.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Plot relation between all variables\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\nsns.pairplot(data=df,hue= 'Gender')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Number of Male and Female\nsns.countplot(x='Gender',data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#BoxPlot \nfor col in df.select_dtypes('int64'): \n    plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))\n    sns.boxplot(x=\"Gender\" ,y=col, data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Takeaways:\n\nThe dataset contain 5 columns and 200 observation.

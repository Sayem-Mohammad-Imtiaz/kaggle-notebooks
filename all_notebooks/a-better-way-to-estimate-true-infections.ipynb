In lieu of good testing, those skilled in disease modelling are able to come up with some very impressive models. Those that are not pandemic experts but are curious anyways have come up with some data-driven ways of estimating the real number of infections. Some of these include mortality (which is about 1% of infections if the healthcare system is not overwhelemed) and ICU (which is about 5%). \n\nHere I present another way of estimating based on the reported number of tests being conducted.\n\n# Summary\nEstimating real infection numbers based on tests could be about as accurate as estimations based on deaths, with the additional benefit of having less of a time-delay than deaths-based estimations.\n\nAccording to my estimates, in Ontario there could be close to 50,000 infections by April 19, almost 5 times the reported number by the province.\n\nSimilar to the reported results, the daily new cases seemed to have plateaued, at around 2000 new cases per day, around 4 times more than the 500-600 new cases per day reported by the province.**\n\nYou are welcome to change this code to analyze another region that you are concerned about.\n\n# Procedure\nImport relevant modules and read in data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting\nimport matplotlib.ticker as plticker  #ticker control\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport os # accessing directory structure\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/covid19testing/tested_worldwide.csv', delimiter=',') \ndf1.dataframeName = 'tested_worldwide.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df1.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Narrow it down to Canada:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1[df1.Country_Region=='Canada']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The ideal place to try-out this new method is in a place where not enough testing is being done.

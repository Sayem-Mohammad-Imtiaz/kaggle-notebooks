Not sure why. \n\nThere are a lot of features to see here. Late at night, we see two main clustersthat stay bright. I believe these are the Meatpacking District (lots of clubs, shuts down aronud 4:00) and the Lower East Side (around St Marks Pl - tons of bars, shuts down around 2:30-3:00). Now, looking at the commute, the morning commute starts with a lot of activity around the Upper West Side, Upper East side, and a broad area including Greenwich Village, Lower East Side, etc. The Village and nearby areas stay bright throughout the day while the UWS and UES darken after the morning rush hour.\n\nMidtown is the site of the most activity, and it's interesting to see how much more active Midtownidtown is compared to the Financial District. One thing I noticed is that the center of Uber activity in Midtown shifts from somewhere probably around Madison or Park over to Times Square after around 8 pm. This maybe suggests either that offices around Times Square keep different hours or that night activity there is dominated by tourists."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7b82b696-87c4-a00b-3aa8-28dd68e789f0"},"source":"# Anomalous Number of Rides on April 7 and 30\nRecall how we saw that April 7th and April 30th seemed to have too many rides.

How do the different airports compare? Maybe they don't have the same schedules. How does the number of Uber pickups compare to the total passenger traffic? It might be hard to find data of the number of people whose final destination was one of the airports. Also, how do the different terminals compare?\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, connecting this data to census data could be fascinating since we might get clues about what kinds of people use Uber, what kinds of neighborhoods are underserved, and more."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2016e9e6-c1e5-71c4-b060-ef5a20a4da70"},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

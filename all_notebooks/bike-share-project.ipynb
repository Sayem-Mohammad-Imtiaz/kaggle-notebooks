The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, I am going to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\n\n## Characters and Teams\n\n* **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels. \n* **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy, which I am in.\n* **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n## The Company\n\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share o ering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n\n## The Marketing strategy\n\nUntil then, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual riders**. Customers who purchase annual memberships are **Cyclistic members**. (A main attribute: casual riders/Cyclistic memebers)\n\n## How the target comes\n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.*(I don't know how. I may find out later in another project. And I'll attach a link here then.) *\nAlthough the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n\n\n## Goal\nDesign marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div id = 'pro'>\n</div>\n\n# My procedure\n\n## Ask\n\nActually, all things about the business task have been shown above.

They took on monopoly power with the Federal Trade Commission, ratified a federal income-tax amendment, and gave federal workers a form of disability insurance. But in a rebuke to Progressive victories, the influenza caused a regressive pandemic. Its first wave disproportionately punished the poor, who worked in closer quarters and lived in smaller apartments than their wealthier counterparts.\n\nOne century later, history is rhyming. The pandemic now bulldozing through the United States will, in its own way, be especially punishing for low-income workers, just as they were starting to reverse a generation of widening inequality.\n\nLike 102 years ago, this wave of the pandemic will almost certainly disproportionately punish the poor—not only by arresting the long recovery since the Great Recession, but also by specifically targeting industries where workers are most vulnerable and have the least protection.\n\n\n\n#Low average wages. Fewer Labor Protections. Remote Work? Simply out of question for them. \n\nWorkers in these sectors—salespeople, waiters, hotel desk clerks, groundskeepers, maids, and entertainment attendants—have a few things in common: First, their average annual wages are less than 30,000, including tips, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The typical annual wage for a full-time worker in the U.S. is about 47,000.) Second, they have the fewest labor protections, such as paid sick leave, and in many cases their tips don’t count as income when they apply for unemployment insurance. Third, they can’t do their work from home. Remote work is the labor market’s only remedy against the virus while Americans are in mass lockdown.\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-will-supercharge-american-inequality/608419/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from PIL import Image\n\nimage = Image.open(\"../input/cusersmarildownloads22430jpeg/22430.jpeg\")\nimage","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#It's not a Democratic Pandemic since the repercussions for those in vulnerability conditons are worst.\n\n#History shows us that plagues can offer tremendous opportunities to break with the status quo.\n\n#The coronavirus has emphasized how fragile and destructive our way of life is, not just for the planet, but also for us.\n\n#It is essential the response is systemic and integrates the health, economic, social and environmental dimensions.\nhttps://feature.undp.org/coronavirus-vs-inequality/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Olga Belitskaya https://www.kaggle.com/olgabelitskaya/sequential-data/comments\nfrom IPython.display import display,HTML\nc1,c2,f1,f2,fs1,fs2=\\\n'#eb3434','#eb3446','Akronim','Smokum',30,15\ndef dhtml(string,fontcolor=c1,font=f1,fontsize=fs1):\n    display(HTML(\"\"\"<style>\n    @import 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=\"\"\"\\\n    +font+\"\"\"&effect=3d-float';</style>\n    <h1 class='font-effect-3d-float' style='font-family:\"\"\"+\\\n    font+\"\"\"; color:\"\"\"+fontcolor+\"\"\"; font-size:\"\"\"+\\\n    str(fontsize)+\"\"\"px;'>%s</h1>\"\"\"%string))\n    \n    \ndhtml('What is true of all the evils in the world is true of plague as well.

Suppose you have two classes in a dataset consisting of 2D points. Now, you want to divide these two classes by boundary. You want the boundary such that the points of two classes are as much further as they can be. Imagine creating a river between these classes, what lies at the bank of river are support vectors. Support vectors help us create that chasm or river or boundary between those data points belonging to the two different classes.\n\nHow does the SVM make predictions then? Using **support vectors**. For the new point, it finds the distance from all the support vectors and takes a decision accordingly.\n\nNow, let's see how we can apply SVM.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd # for reading files\nimport numpy as np # for numerical manipulations\nfrom sklearn import svm # for using SVM","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/support-vector-machine-svm/svm_data.csv') # loaded the data","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_x = np.array(data[data.columns[:2]]) # segregate the input points (2-D)\ndata_y = np.array(data['y']) # segregate the  output class","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll first look at the SVM with linear kernel.

What is [RBF-kernel](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels.RBF.html)? Radial basis function is a function employing exponential to transform the distance between two points. What does this give us? Exaggeration of closeness and distance between two points. If the points are close, then, the value of the function shoots up and if they are far away, it diminishes by a large amount.\n\nHow is this different from a linear kernel? In a linear kernel, there is no exaggeration of the distance.\n\nHow does this help us? It eases the process of segregating the points, since, due to exaggeration (exponentiation) of the distance, finding boundaries becomes easier.\n\nImagine the points are on the globe. By applying RBF kernel, you concentrate them on the poles. This leaves a lot of space around the equator through which you can draw the boundary between the points of two classes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"r_clf = svm.SVC() # created the RBF classifier","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"r_clf.fit(data_x, data_y) # fit the data using the above classifier","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.svm import SVC\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure\n\nfigure(figsize=(10, 10))\n\nplot_decision_regions(data_x, data_y, clf=r_clf, legend=2)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Above, we see the 2D points of input data seperated by a closed curve (created due to RBF kernel).

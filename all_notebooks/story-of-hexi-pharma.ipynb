Several of the survivors from Colectiv nightclub fire were reported with nosocomial infections. It is clear now that due to these nosocomial infections, at least three (but probably much more of them) died. \n\nStarting from this, the public realised that Hexi Pharma had sold diluted disinfectants and other under-standard medical supplies to hospitals in all parts of the country.  Consequently their actions would have most probably caused in time another hundreds or maybe up to tens of thousands of deaths due to supra-infections of patients of hospitals around the country.\n\nOnly after the nosocomial infections of patients from Colectiv nightclub fire the larger public in Romania understood the dimmension of this phenomena: nosocomial infections in hospitals. In parallel, the public understood also that the phenomena was hidden from the public by systematic under-reporting by hospital authorities.\n\nNow I will analyze in detail the contracts of Hexi Pharma with the various public hospitals around the country, to assess the dimmension of their impact on public health and patients wellbeing for the entire period when they were in business (and for which we have data, i.e. from 2007 to 2016).\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-10-18T15:36:57.594068Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-10-18T15:36:57.593232Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-10-18T15:36:58.858498Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-10-18T15:36:58.857801Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.325319,"end_time":"2020-10-18T15:36:58.858647","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-18T15:36:57.533328","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport re\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport warnings \nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-10-18T15:36:59.095741Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-10-18T15:36:59.094229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-10-18T15:37:21.830482Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-10-18T15:37:21.829763Z"},"papermill":{"duration":22.801339,"end_time":"2020-10-18T15:37:21.830627","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-18T15:36:59.029288","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/public-tenders-romania-20072016/contracts.csv\", low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.056558,"end_time":"2020-10-18T15:37:24.872547","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-18T15:37:24.815989","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='2'>Data about Hexi Pharma</a>\n\nLet's select the data about Hexi Pharma.

Please let me know in the comments to improve it.\n* Overall, this is part of my learning journey as well as a business management scholar. So, I will just focus on the 'broad overview' of the algorithms, and shed a light more on *making sense* of how data can be used for better decision making\n\nYou can upvote if you like this notebook.

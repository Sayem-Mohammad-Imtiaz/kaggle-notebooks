A handful of minutes.\n\nThis notebook will aim to provide an explanation and application of different feature ranking methods, namely that of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), Stability Selection, linear models as well as Random Forest. But first off, it is always imperative to give credit where credit is due. The stuff in this notebook is indebted to and borrows heavily from the excellent 4-part blog article by Ando Saabas on feature selection. So please do check out his article from this link: http://blog.datadive.net/selecting-good-features-part-iv-stability-selection-rfe-and-everything-side-by-side/ \n\nThe contents of this notebook are as follows: \n\n 1. **Data Cleaning and Visualisation** : This section will revolve around exploring the data and visualising some summary statistics. \n 2. **Stability Selection via Randomised Lasso Method** : Introduce a relatively new feature selection method called \"Stability Selection\" and using the Randomised Lasso in its implementation\n 3. **Recursive Feature Elimination** : Implementing the Recursive Feature Elimination method of feature ranking via the use of basic Linear Regression \n 4. **Linear Model Feature Coefficients** : Implementing 3 of Sklearn's linear models (Linear Regression, Lasso and Ridge) and using the inbuilt estimated coefficients for our feature selection\n 5. **Random Forest Feature Selection** : Using the Random Forest's convenient attribute \"feature_importances\" to calculate and ultimately rank the feature importance.\n\nFinally, with all the points 1 to 5 above, we will combine the results to create our:\n\n**Feature Ranking Matrix** : Matrix of all the features along with the respective model scores which we can use in our ranking.\n ","metadata":{"_uuid":"cde1f7416981edcc7951bbc7a4928933b7ba3760","_cell_guid":"6ea51bc1-c7e6-5022-f91e-5933202f9f3a"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import RFE, f_regression\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import (LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, RandomizedLasso)\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor","metadata":{"_uuid":"8e0e4f54f2e722ae2cbf175d284d3a3cc0baf024","_cell_guid":"15b3d941-c4a4-4c3f-bef1-4c4fcce4a33a","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-20T17:19:55.570146Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-20T17:19:55.570619Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-20T17:19:56.668353Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-20T17:19:55.570574Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-20T17:19:56.667442Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Here we were tasked to improve the marketing strategy for the smart devices products of health-focused manufacturer for women, Bellabeat.\n\nThe main goals are:\n* What are the trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* What features should Bellabeat products consider adding to entice more customers?\n\nFor this case I will use Python despite it wasn't the language of the Data Analytics Course by Google. \nSo if you find some pieces of code thad you would like to improve, write the comment. \n\n### Uploading Data\nWe will use public data that explores smart device users' daily habits [www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)\n\nThis data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.\n\nThere are a number of different csv files that range from Daily activity, calories, steps; hourly calories, intensities, and steps, and heart rate, sleep data and weight logs.\n\n\n### Data preparation\nWe’ll create our data frames. The data frames I’ll be working with will be creating objects for:\n* daily_activity\n* daily calories\n* daily sleep\n* weight log info\n* daily intensities\n\nWe’ll follow typical naming conventions based on the csv file names. \nLet's load the libraries and csv files to have a first look at it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Data Cleaning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#load libraries\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotnine\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-11T07:52:27.589943Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-11T07:52:27.590583Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-11T07:52:31.449069Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-11T07:52:27.590546Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-11T07:52:31.447485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we are loading the relevant files for us.

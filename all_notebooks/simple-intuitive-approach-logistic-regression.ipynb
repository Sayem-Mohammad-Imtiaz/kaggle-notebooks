A good example would be a feature called _t-shirt size_ with 3 unique values _small_, _medium_ or _large_, which have an intrinsic order.\n\n__However__, in our case, only some of our features have 2 unique values (most of them have more), and none of them are _ordinal categorical_ (in fact they they are _nominal categorical_, which means they have no intrinsic order).\n\nTherefore, we will only apply Label Encoding to those features with a binary set of values:\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d0c1a9db839e7dac6c7ae24f885f362e8fc3243e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in df.columns:\n    if len(df[col].value_counts()) == 2:\n        le = LabelEncoder()\n        le.fit(df[col])\n        df[col] = le.transform(df[col])\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"329b0567fe43d24ad24cd5b703ed3ed41ad25d19"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see how it has converted some of the features to values of 0 or 1.

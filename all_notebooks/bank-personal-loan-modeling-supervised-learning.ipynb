And **(b)** independent variables are indpendent of each other, means no multicollinearity between the independent variables. In this particular case both the assumsions are true. It can be seen in below mentioned correlation heatmap. **Please note earlier we had dropped 'age' attribute which had correlation of $ \\rho = 0.99$ with 'experience' attribute.**\n* **On scaled dataset :** With scaled dataset we can see that performance of K-NN classifier works best which has accuracy of 96.933% and f1-score of 81.300%.

\nCOVID-19 is a new virus and there are still many things to research and deepen, with these results we realized that luckily there are more cured than dead but there are no predictions for a drop in

Although there are people in the risk group who are contaminated, the results showed that a large part of those currently being contaminated are young. Even though the peak is among the elderly aged 60 to 70 years. It is worth mentioning that many of these young people may be infected but asymptomatic, which aggravates the situation of those who have agreed with these asymptomatic young people and may have been infected. Many countries do not have the best healthcare network and treatment conditions:\n\n* lack of professionals\n* lack of suitable materials\n* problems with testing\n\nThe poor conditions of the health system lead to the prediction of the increase in deaths, as well as many countries that did not adhere to the quarantine, some are in the process of resuming and have already made the quarantine more flexible, which may corroborate to keep the increasing number of contaminated.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

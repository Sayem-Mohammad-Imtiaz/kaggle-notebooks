The Spanish government has been very adamant with the claim that the private sector competitivity gains (thanks to the profit-led strategy) have increased Spain's exports and pulled the country out of the recession.\n\n**Macroeconomic strategy approach: Profit-led**\n\nCompanies gaining competitivity thanks to labor costs reductions - with a strong adjustment of salaries and labor income. Although this approach has brought Catalan, and for an extension, Spanish exports to record numbers, and also has spurred capital investment thanks to higher corporate profits, the impact and social effects of the crisis have lasted longer in Spain than in most OECD economies. \n\nMany theorists argue that a  **Wage-led growth strategy**  with the prioritization of the stimulation of the GDP via private internal demand, **private consumption expenditures** would have been a most optimal strategy for the economic recovery than an export-oriented recovery via lower wages and labour income devaluation, which limited the expansion of the private consumption expenditures. As the professor of economics Engelbert Stockhammer (Kingston University, UK) defends, however, in order to have a balanced Wage-led growth strategy, higher labor incomes have to be aligned with human-capital marginal productivity gains.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this paper is not to prove which approach would have been more optimal for pulling Spain and Catalonia out of the recession.

In principle, the dataset holds users, their playlists and the tracks contained in these playlists. \n\nThe csv-file holding the dataset contains the following columns: \n\"user_id\", \"artistname\", \"trackname\", \"playlistname\"\n, where\n- user_id is a hash of the user's Spotify user name\n- artistname is the name of the artist\n- trackname is the title of the track and\n- playlistname is the name of the playlist that contains this track.\n\nThe separator used is , each entry is enclosed by double quotes and the escape character used is \\.\n\n\n\nA description of the generation of the dataset and the dataset itself can be found in the following paper:\n\nPichl, Martin; Zangerle, Eva; Specht, GÃ¼nther: \"Towards a Context-Aware Music Recommendation Approach: What is Hidden in the Playlist Name?\" in 15th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDM 2015), pp. 1360-1365, IEEE, Atlantic City, 2015."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### Load the required packages in the required format\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport warnings\n\n%matplotlib notebook\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pickle\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### Read the datasets from the given locations and do following\npath = \"../input/spotify-playlist/\"\nfilename = \"spotify_dataset.csv\"\n### While Loading datasets we say error_bad_lines = false which drops rows with errors \n### As it is experimental project and we have huge datasets, dropping 100-200 Bad rows will not impact any results\nprint (\"Reading the data\")\nspotify_data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(path,filename),escapechar= '.',error_bad_lines = False,warn_bad_lines=False)\nprint (\"Read Succesful with shape {}\".format(spotify_data.shape))\n### Columns names were not very clean give them manual names\nspotify_data.columns = ['user_id','artistname','trackname','playlistname']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Lets look at the few stats about the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print (\"Some General statistics about data are as follows:\",spotify_data.info())\nprint (\"Lets look at the summary stats about the data :\",spotify_data.describe(include ='object'))\nprint (\"The number of rows in the datasets are as follows :\",spotify_data.shape[0])\nprint (\" The columns in the data are as follows :\",spotify_data.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### Lets first look at the distribution of number of playlist by user_id\nspotify_user_summary = spotify_data.groupby(['user_id'])[\"playlistname\"].nunique().reset_index()\n### Just for better visualisation remove very high playlist\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(2, figsize=(6,8))\nsns.distplot(spotify_user_summary['playlistname'], hist=True,ax = ax[0])\nax[0].set_title(\"Number of playlist per user\")\nspotify_user_summary = spotify_user_summary[spotify_user_summary['playlistname'] <= 50]\nsns.distplot(spotify_user_summary['playlistname'], hist=True,ax=ax[1])\nax[1].set_title(\"Number of playlist per user (where <=50)\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Insight 1 \n###### Above Plot shows that data is skewed toward smaller number of playlist.

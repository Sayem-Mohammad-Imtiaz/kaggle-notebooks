Because the number of cities covered by both Enexis and Liander are comparable in size while Stedin is not, it is easier to visualize how the three of them changed altogether by plotting a rescaled feature, where zero and one mean the mininum and maximum value, respectively, they ever had. We observe an increase in Stedin from 2009 to 2013 and then a sudden reduction followed by another increase. Importantly, we cannot judge how significant was the change but only the behavior along the years. If one looks at the tables before, it is easy to see that for Stedin the changes are a few cities more or less. Similarly, for Enexis and Liander, the changes do not represent a huge increase/descrease. However, we may ask if the change from 2012 to 2013 means that some cities previously covered by Stedin passed to either Enexis or Liander. Does this exchanging behavior mean that cities have changed their net manager?

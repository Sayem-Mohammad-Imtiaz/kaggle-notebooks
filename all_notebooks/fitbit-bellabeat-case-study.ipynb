Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.\n#### Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new \n#### growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain \n#### insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.\n#### You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n## Phase 1 - Ask\n\n### Business Task\n\n#### Analyse smart device usage behaviour and identify users' current trends.\n#### Understand how Bellabeat's marketing strategy can be improved based on such trends, thus driving engagement and increasing Bellabeat's revenue and user base. \n\n## Phase 2 - Prepare\n\n#### The data used in the analysis was retrieved from the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit .\n#### However, it is also publicly avaialable on the Zenodo website: https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.YMoUpnVKiP9 .\n\n#### The data is organised in different files, which contain health app user behaviour. Some files contain the wide version and some the narrow version of the same data.\n\n#### It was generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk and contains records provided by 30 people which will hopefully be enough to reflect the entire population.\n#### The data can be considered reliable, original, current (it dates back to 2016), comprehensive (it contains all the information needed to solve the business task) and cited (it was uploaded to Kaggle by an experienced user).\n\n#### The data has a license, it is private since it is anonymised. In terms of accessibility, the data is open and available on the Zenodo website, as mentioned above. \n\n#### In terms of integrity, we can assume that data is accurate. It is complete in terms of included fields. It is also consistent and trustworthy.\n\n## Phase 3 - Process\n\n### Data manipulation through SQL\n\n#### After downloading them, the files were uploaded to Big Query through Google Cloud (not possible to upload them directly to BigQuery becasue of file size). I therefore managed to set up a dataset made up of different tables - one table for each of the files uploaded. \n\n#### All tables are related to each other thanks to the Id and the time/date columns. These latter columns bear different names in the tables (e.g: ActivityDate). In some cases the date columns used to join tables have timeptamp as data type, so they needed to be cast to date. \n\n#### After analysing the contents of all the tables, I eventually decided to use the daily_activity and sleep_per_day_merged tables since they contain most of the metrics needed for the analysis. \n\n#### I joined the two tables with SQL and downloaded the view obtained as a csv file by using the following code:\n\n#### SELECT da.Id,\n#### da.ActivityDate AS date,\n#### CAST(da.TotalSteps AS INTEGER) As steps,\n#### da.Calories AS calories,\n#### sl.TotalMinutesAsleep,\n#### sl.TotalTimeInBed,\n#### da.VeryActiveMinutes,\n#### da.FairlyActiveMinutes,\n#### da.LightlyActiveMinutes,\n#### da.SedentaryMinutes,\n#### ROUND(da.VeryActiveDistance,2) AS very_active_distance,\n#### ROUND(da.ModeratelyActiveDistance,2) AS  moderately_active_distance,\n#### ROUND(da.LightActiveDistance,2) AS lightly_active_distance,\n#### da.SedentaryActiveDistance\n#### FROM `case-studies-314618.fitbit_fitness_tracker_data.daily_activity` da INNER JOIN `case-studies-314618.fitbit_fitness_tracker_data.sleep_day_merged` sl \n#### ON da.Id = sl.Id AND sl.SleepDay = da.ActivityDate;\n\n#### I then uploaded it to further manipulate and analyse the data through Python.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T14:28:43.757911Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T14:28:43.758246Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.40085Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T14:28:43.758217Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.400008Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data manipulation through Python","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Importing Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Uploading the csv file containing the relevant data.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/fitbit-bellabeat-case-study-selected-fields/case_study_2.csv')\ndf.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.403491Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.403966Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.48124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.40392Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.480372Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Checking if there are nay missing values across columns\n\ndf.isnull().any()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.482811Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.483113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.492499Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.483083Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.491415Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Checking data format across columns\n\ndf.dtypes","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.494297Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.494674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.503653Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.494641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.502694Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Convertng date column to datetime\n\ndf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.505053Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.505426Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.515112Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.50539Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-03T14:28:45.513942Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Plotting distributions to check for outliers.

In the US, 610,000 people die from heart diseases every year, which is equivalent to 1 in 4 deaths. Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, which is reduced blood flow to the heart, causing 370,000 deaths every year. Several physiological factors can give rise to heart diseases, such as high cholesterol levels and high blood presure (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). \n\nThe dataset presented in this notebook contains patients and information on various variables as well as a target variable that specifies whether a patient has more than 50% of arteries that leading to the heart occluded. The 50% threshold is an indication for significant narrowing, and is a sign for cardiologists and other physicians to perform further diagnosis (Harris et al, 1980). This notebook analyzes the different variables in the dataset and answer the following questions:\n\n1. How much are the individual variables associated with diameter narrowing? (Related findings highlighted in blue)\n2. How do the variables between males and females?

Interestingly, physiological factors such as cholesterol level and blood pressure do not provide much insight on predicting heart disease, however this may be affected by limiting data for females. The biggest difference between males and females discovered in this notebook is cholesterol level, where females haev much higher cholesterol levels than males. Note that cholesterol can be in the form of <u>low density lipoprotein (LDL)</u> or <u>high density lipoprotein (HDL)</u>. LDL is harmful to the body as it leads to plaque building up in arteries, however HDL is beneficial to the body. Females have higher cholesterol levels because oestrogen boosts HDL levels, however HDL levels fall after menopause and LDL level rises (Michos, E.D.). Therefore, a better way to show cholesterol level would be to show the LDL and HDL levels individually.\n\nIn addition to understanding the factors affecting heart disease, this notebook also constructed a decision tree model to classify whether a patient has significant heart disease. The model only achieved a ROC score of 0.78. Although the prediction could be affected by limited data, other machine learning and statistical models can be used to determine the best way to predict heart disease."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Cardiac Stress Testing Review.

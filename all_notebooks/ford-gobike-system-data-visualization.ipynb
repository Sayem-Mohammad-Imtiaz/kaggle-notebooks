The efficient/short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their high concentration on rush hours Monday through Friday, indicating the use is primarily for work commute. The more relaxing and flexible pattern of customer use shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system quite differently from the subscribers, heavily over weekends and in the afternoon, for city tour or leisure purpose probably.        \n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\n\nThe interactions between features are all supplementing each other and quite make sense when looked at combined, there's no big surprise observed. The usage habit difference between male and female is not that much or obvious throughout the exploration, which could be related to the imbalanced number of female riders/records compared to male ones.

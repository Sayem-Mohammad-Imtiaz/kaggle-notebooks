Welcome!\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1170/img/office_cast.jpeg\" alt=\"Markdown\">.</p>\n<p><strong>The Office!</strong> What started as a British mockumentary series about office culture in 2001 has since spawned ten other variants across the world, including an Israeli version (2010-13), a Hindi version (2019-), and even a French Canadian variant (2006-2007). Of all these iterations (including the original), the American series has been the longest-running, spanning 201 episodes over nine seasons.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, we will use the following dataset: <code>datasets/office_episodes.csv</code>, which was downloaded from Kaggle <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This dataset contains information on a variety of characteristics of each episode.

An observation which is quite noticiable is the episode with viewership of more than 22.5 million, it might seem like an outlier caused by discrepancies in the data but it is in fact accurate. \n\nFinally, we have extracted a list of the guest stars which brought in most viewership to an episode and that concludes our analysis.\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

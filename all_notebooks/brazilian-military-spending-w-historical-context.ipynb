Several of the most important moments in brazilian history are a product of direct on indirect action of its armed forces.\n\nSeveral examples could be brought to light: Brazil's current president, elected in 2018, was formerly in the army and uses this fact as his political ground. During 1964-1985 Brazil lived under a military government, without direct elections, a period which is known for its several disruptions of humans rights. Going back even further, the military also played a role in Brazil's proclamation of the republic.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll visualize the data provided for Brazil's military spending, adding some historical context when it seems appropiate, in order to better understand not only the data, but also Brazil's history and politics.\n\nObviosuly I have my own opinions about the military, their practices, and wheter they should receive the amount of money they receive. Exploring this, however, is not the goal of this analysis.

As it's possible to visualize, in this period the military budget grew ever so steadily. \n\nDuring these years the world was a boiling pot. The [cold war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) was a reality and [Brazil and it's military government were under direct influence (to put it lightly) of the US government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Brazilian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat#US_involvement). In a way, Brazil was aspiring to be the US role model for capitalism in South America, in an attempt to draw investments from capitalists and multinational companies. \n\nIn the late 60s and early 70s this strategy worked. Under the heavy influx of money coming from foreign companies recently installed in Brazil, [the country's economy bloomed and grew over 10% a year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Miracle). This growth, however, also caused a huge increase on social and economical inequality in the country, since the military government economical policy was sumarized as: \"let the cake grow before cutting it\", meaning let us enrich ourselves before distributing the wealth. Wealth was not distributed to this day.\n\nIn 1973 the world was hit with a new oil crisis and Brazil was hit particularly hard, since most of it's capital came from foreign companies and investors. This however, had no reflections on the military budged, which kept it's steady growth with no interruptions, as we can see in the graphs above. The military government strategy to overcome the oil crisis was to keep borrowing money from internation investors. In the late 70s, a new energy crisis hit the worlds economy, and the brazilian military economical strategy spirals down, [leaving the country in a state of recession and hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Miracle#Problems). Only in the late 70s and as we enter the 80s, Brazil started saw a slight dop and stabilization in military spendings. Not for long.\n\nRight after the end of the dictatoship, the military received an enourmous boost in their budget. Let's drill a little bit further down and see what happend around the year of 1985.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"_years = tuple([str(y) for y in list(range(1984, 2000))])\ndf_80s = df_pre_2k.transpose()\ndf_80s = df_80s.loc[:, df_80s.columns.str.startswith(_years)].transpose().div(10)\ndf_80s.div(10**9).plot.bar(figsize=(10,8), legend=False, rot=0, title=\"Military spending in Brazil in billions of US$\");","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pct_serie = df_80s.transpose().iloc[0].pct_change()\npct_serie[1:].multiply(100).plot.bar(figsize=(10,8), rot=0, title=\"Brazil's military spending change by year in percentage\", color=(pct_serie[1:] > 0).map({True: 'C0', False: 'C1'}));","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"budgets_comp = df_80s.transpose()[[\"1984\", \"1987\"]].iloc[0].pct_change()[1]\nbudgets_comp","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, from 1984 to 87 brazilians military budged more than doubled. But why? Brazil was not involved in any wars at the time and there wasn't any threat to national security that could justify such a large boost in the money directed to armed forces.\n\nThe availabe data provides no answer to this question but yet again some historical context might help us better understand it.\n\nAs already pointed out, until 1985 Brazil was governed by the military, who nominated themselves presidents to the country. In 1985, even tough the military dictatorship ended, Brazil was not directly back to a democratic regime. Instead, [the brazilian congress appointed a new, civilian president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_in_Brazil#Transition_to_democracy,_Figueiredo)[1].\n\nAltough we can't entail this from the available data, I see a very strong correlation between the end of the military regime and their sudden boost in budget. It is a possibility that during their government brazilian military were using presidential and national budgets to finance their own activities, salaries and privileges. That money and privilegies couldn't be just washed away and so arrangements could have been made with the new appointed president to ensure that he would heftly fund his predecessors. Again, this is a personal conclusion which is not confirmed nor denied by the data available. The data, in fact, only shows us the increase of more than 100% in the armed forces budget in a couple years right after the end of their government.\n\nAs said above, in the early 70s Brazil was living a period of big economical and inequality growth. This growth, however, was interrupted by the oil crisis from the mid and late 70s, which started a new decline in the country's economy. [By the mid 80s and early 90s Brazil was deep into an economical crisis, inflation indexes were hitting new records on a daily basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Brazil), but this did not stopped the military from receiving a big bonus to their budget as seen above. All this mismanagement of the brazilian economy culminated in the early 90s in an even bigger financial crisis, which in it's turn culminated in the impeachment of Brazil's president at the time, [Fernando Collor de Mello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Collor_de_Mello). This possibly explains the big drop on spending that we visualized happening in 1991 and 1992 on the graph above.\n\nCollor was Brazil's first elected president after the military dictatorship and he was impeached in 1992, with Itamar Franco assuming his place in the same year. On the next year we see again big boosts to the military budget, reaching an increase of more than 40% a year. To put it in another way: after the military dictatorship ended in Brazil, of the three next president's to assume, the only one who did not gave massive raises to military budget was impeached two years into his mandate. Yet again in other words: if you are Brazil's president, you either give the military a raise or you're fired.\n\nIn 1995 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso) assumed the president's office, becoming the first brazilian president after the military government to sucessfuly reduce their budget and finish his term. In fact, FHC got reelected and served two presidential terms, leaving office in the end of 2002.

This trend continued until the end of FHCs tenure, as demonstrated in the line graph above.\n\nOne of FHC's main governmental plans was the [privatization of many of brazilian's public services and companies, such as banks, road, energy and telephone companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso#Presidency_(1995%E2%80%932002)). This obvisouly was very appealing to the brazilian's right wing, which might have helped to keep him in a stable position as president, even tough he was reducing the military budget.\n\nHowever, in 2003 [Lula](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In%C3%A1cio_Lula_da_Silva) assumed the presidential's office. Lula is, and always has been, a controversial political figure. He was the leader of the brazilian's worker party (PT) and a member of the armed resistence against the military dictatorship. He was also a known comunist during the 80s. Yes, a comunist president in a country that was under a right winged military regime less than twenty years before. How could this be manageble?

For a comunist, he sure does like a right winged military. \n\nAgain, during this period Brazil was not involved in any war and there wasn't any direct threats to national security. However, the world was forever changed in 2001 with the terrorist attacks against the USA. This caused a worldwide increase in military spendings and could be one of the reasons, altough certainly not the only one, for Lula's actions regarding this topic. Still during Lula's tenure, [Haiti was hit by a very destructive earthquake. Brazil sent it's armed forces to help rebuild and secure the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake#Rescue_and_relief_efforts), which also could be one of the reasons for an increasing budget.\n\nAfter Lula's terms ended, [Dilma Roussef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilma_Rousseff) assumed the presidency. She was also a member of the worker's party (PT), also had a comunist background, and also participated in armed resistence against the military dictatorship. She, however, did not play the same game as Lula, decreasing the military's budget year after year into her mandate.\nDilma was elected in 2010, assuming the presidency in 2011, and completing her first term as president in 2014, succesfully decrasing the military budget on every year but the first, as we see above. She got reelected on 2014 for four more years as a president. However, on 2016 she was also impeached, with [Michel Temer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Temer), her VP, assuming the presidency still in 2016. Right in the next year Temer also increased the military budget. He finished his mandate in the end of 2018, when Brazil's current president was elected and assumed office in 2019. This is also where our data ends.\n\nFrom all of this we can draw many conclusions. To me the most appealing was to visualize that two out of the three presidents that reduced the military budget during their governments got impeached. The only one who did not get removed from the office is most famous for privatizing brazilian public companies, a traditional right-winged economical and political desire.\n\nAlso, the fact that a president reduced the military budget helps to show his political guidance. Brazil is traditionally a right winged country, specially among the richest and most powerful. Having a president reduce the military budget doesn't reasonate well with these people, and it's often seen as an aproximation with the left wing and a direct threat to their economical and political status.\n\nThis data helped us visualize not only the magnitude of Brazil's spending with its military (an amount higher than 25 billion dollars per year), but also to explore some of our country's politics and economics.

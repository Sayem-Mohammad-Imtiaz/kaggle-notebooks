I had a course about this like 5 years ago, and I couldn't remember anything about it. So, as I always do I googled how it is done. And to my surprise everyone is talking about the time series forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA. However, when it comes to selecting and choosing the parameters it seems blurry. \n\nThere are some predefined libraries/modules that do this selection for you. However, if you are like me and you want to know how exactly this is done well you are in the right place. I mean even if you use automatic methods, it doesn't hurt to know how it works behind that black box. \n\nSo I spend some time looking, watching videos, reading books etc. And I think I finally figured it out. Atleast, the results are more efficient and the methodology quite make sense. \n\nI, then, decided to share a summary some sort of a guide or a cheat sheet to the selection of ARIMA/SARIMA parameters. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Methodology \n\n1. First, you should know the nature of the signal/series. I suggest plotting it and see if you can recognize a pattern and if the curve has a certain trend. Sometimes, it is clear the eye other times you should look more into things. Like for example, you can see the decomposition of the serial using the seasonal_decompose method. Also, sometimes the autocorrelation ACF and the partial-autocorrelation PACF of the series can help. If the trend is not that clear you can check if the signal is stationary or not (i.e. if it has a trend and this can be done using hypothesis testing like Augmented Dickey-Fuller test). \n\n2. Now, you know the composition of your signal. Now we get to the math part when we will compute differenciation of the signal until it no longer has a seasonal component nor a trend. In other words until it becomes stationary.\n\n    a. if your signal has **Trend** and **Seasonality**, mostly you will differenciate according to the seasonality period and then simple differenciate to eliminate the trend like **signal.diff(12).diff(1)** if my signal has a seasonality of 12 and a linear trend. Usually, a signal seasonality differenciation is enough. However, you might need more than one simple trend differenciation. PS: the number of times you differenciation for seasonality or for trend correspond to the D and d parameters of the SARIMA model (i.e. the Integrated part of SARIMA).\n    \n    b. if your signal has only **Trend**. Easy right you will only do simple differenciation and you will be using ARIMA model since no **S**easonality. \n    \n    c. if only **Seasonality** you do the seasonality differenciation you'll be using SARIMA model and the trend differenciation parameter \"p\" equals to zero. \n    \n    d. if **no** trend **nor** seasonality, this means your signal is already stationary, you can directly use ARIMA with d equals to zero. However, predicting this will be quite hard. Because, it means that it is almost random noise (White noise). \n    \n3. Once you make your signal stationary, now we go to identify the other parameters (p and P for auto-regressive component and seasonal auto-regressive component) and (q and Q for moving average and seasonal moving average components). **The Tricky Part**: \n\n    a. ACF plot gives you an idea about how correlated your signal with it's previous lags. This plot will help identify the moving average components. So we look at low ranked lags and see those that are significant. and the first one is your **q**. Now if you have a seasonal component, look at the multiples of the seasonality period, if you find significant lags, that's your **Q**. \n    \n    b. PACF plot gives the idea about the auto-regressive part of the model. Similarly to the ACF, we identify **p** with law rank lags and **P** (if we have seasonal component) is identified through the multiples of the seasonality periode. \n    \nNow this gives you a good starting point. You can always go for automated modules. And you can push results further by using grid search. \n\nNow, let's go for some examples of this.

There are some predefined libraries that does the optimization of the parameters using/or not grid search, such for example \"pmdarima\" etc.. Although, I personnally prefer this long method. \n\nThere are other methods of time series forecasting like recurrent neural network etc that are in some way more efficient that statistical methods. Such models can integrate more variables than the signal alone. However, the statistical methods could add some variation to your models (let's say if you want to make an ensemble model). Or you could use their predictions as an input to other models. \n\nI hope this notebook could be of help to you. Please let me know if there are some improvement to be made.

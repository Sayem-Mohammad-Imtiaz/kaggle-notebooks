Observed values above the mean have positive standard scores, while values below the mean have negative standard scores. Standard Score is a very useful statistic because it (a) allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution and (b) enables us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.\n    \n    It is calculated by subtracting the population mean from an individual raw score and then dividing the difference by the population standard deviation. It is a dimensionless quantity. This conversion process is called standardizing or normalizing.\n\n    Standard scores are also called z-values, z-scores, normal scores, and standardized variables.\n    Computing a z-score requires knowing the mean and standard deviation of the complete population to which a data point belongs; if one only has a sample of observations from the population, then the analogous computation with sample mean and sample standard deviation yields the t-statistic."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Boxplots for Quantitative Data - A type of Graphical Representation for Univariate analysis\n\n\nThere are alternatives to Box Plot like Swarm plots, strip plots, Violin plots especially if there is a need to group it with a categorical variable."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A Boxplot is basically a Visual Picture of the 5-number summary we saw above. \n\nThe length of the box is the IQR(Q3 - Q1), a nice measure of spread."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](http://jukebox.esc13.net/interactiveGlossary/HTML_images/boxPlot_example.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Let us take the availability of the rooms in a year and Visually check the 5-number summary."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nax = sns.boxplot(x=lis[\"availability_365\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"    - From the Plot above, we can see the IQR to be around 125(Length of the Box), meaning most listings are available for a maximum of 4 Months. \n    - The Distribution is also right-skewed as we can see a lot of values to the extreme right.\n    - The Median is Approximately 10.\n    - The dots seen on the right end are outliers, meaning values > 1.5 times and < 3 times the IQR."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lis_sum['security_deposit'] = lis_sum['security_deposit'].str.replace('$', '')\nlis_sum['security_deposit'] = lis_sum['security_deposit'].str.replace(',', '')\nlis_sum['security_deposit'] = lis_sum['security_deposit'].fillna(0)\nlis_sum['security_deposit'] = lis_sum['security_deposit'].astype(str).astype(float)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Another Box plot, this time interactive one to see Security deposits grouped by Room types"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.express as px\n#tips = px.data.tips()\nfig = px.box(lis_sum, x=\"room_type\", y=\"security_deposit\")\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lis_sum.groupby('room_type')['security_deposit'].mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Just to Confirm, the values are very minimal that min and other  values are not seen.

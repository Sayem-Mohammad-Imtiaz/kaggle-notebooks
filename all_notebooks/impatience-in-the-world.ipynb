Building on this phrase we may say that there are two main strata in the Book of Job: the Book of Job the Patient, or JP; and the Book of Job the Impatient, or JIP.\"\n\nhttps://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004275409/B9789004275409-s007.xml","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Code by Sandhya S https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/sweden-the-most-patient-country","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/most-patient-countries/country-variation-in-patience.csv')\ndf.tail().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'purple',\n                                     'color': 'white'})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:34:51.630983Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:34:51.631494Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:34:51.70773Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:34:51.631454Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:34:51.707077Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:35:32.217682Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:35:32.218036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:35:32.226076Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:35:32.218005Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:35:32.225017Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Sandhya S https://www.kaggle.com/sansuthi/sweden-the-most-patient-country\n\ndf.Patience = np.round(df.Patience, decimals=3)\ndf = df.sort_values('Patience', ascending=True).set_index('Country')\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:36:39.250615Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:36:39.250937Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:36:39.269958Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:36:39.250911Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:36:39.269256Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"Many of the world's most patient populations are located in Europe or the English-speaking world, while risk taking is particularly prevalent in Africa and the Middle East.

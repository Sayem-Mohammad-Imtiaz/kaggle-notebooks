Each row represents a different college major and contains information on things such as gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. The columns in the dataset are as follows.\n\n- `Rank` - Rank by median earnings. Note that the dataset is ordered by this column.\n- `Major_code` - Major code.\n- `Major` - Major description.\n- `Major_category` - Category of major, as determined by the report [*What's It Worth?: THe Economic Value of College Majors* by Carnevale et al](http://cew.georgetown.edu/whatsitworth)\n- `Total` - Total number of people with major.\n- `Sample_size` - Sample size (unweighted) of full-time, year-round workers **only**, who reported earnings of at least \\$1. This sample is used for computing the earnings columns `Median`, `P25th`, and `P75th` for each major.\n- `Men` - Number of male graduates.\n- `Women` - Number of female graduates.\n- `ShareWomen` - Proportion of women as share of total.\n- `Employed` - Number employed in civilian jobs.\n- `Full_time` - Number employed who work 35 hours or more per week.\n- `Part_time` - Number employed who work less than 35 hours per week\n- `Full_time_year_round` - Number employed at least 50 weeks of the year and work at least 35 hours per week.\n- `Unemployed` - Number unemployed (not employed or in the armed forces and actively looking for work)\n- `Unemployment_rate` - (Number Unemployed) / (Number Unemployed + Number Employed).\n- `Median` - Median earnings of full-time, year-round workers, in USD.\n- `P25th` - 25th percentile of earnings of full-time, year-round workers, in USD.\n- `P75th` - 75th percentile of earnings of full-time, year-round workers, in USD.\n- `College_jobs` - Number with job requiring a college degree.\n- `Non_college_jobs` - Number with job not requiring a college degree.\n- `Low_wage_jobs` - Number in low-wage service jobs.\n\nThis goal of this project is to use visualizations to explore questions from the dataset. Some of the questions we will explore include:\n\n- Do students in more popular majors make more money? (Use scatterplots.)\n- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? (Use histograms.)\n- Which categories of majors have the most students?

In particular, we started by using scatterplots to relate pairs of numeric variables and histograms to visualize the distributions of numeric variables. We also explored how to quickly visualize the pairwise relationships and distributions of multiple numeric variables at once by producing scatterplot matrices. From there, we transitioned to using barplots to compare estimates of central tendency between categories and boxplots to compare the distributions of a numeric variable between different categories. These visualizations allowed us to explore questions such as how median salary for a major is related to the proportion of women in that major and how do unemployment rates and median salaries compare between different major categories.\n\nBeyond the work we have done in this notebook, there are a number of potential next steps. Some of them include the following.\n\n- Download the PUMS data for 2013-2018, clean and aggregate it, and recreate all of the visualizations we have made in this notebook.\n- Download the PUMS data for 2005-2018, clean and aggregate it, and produce animated or interactive visualizations to see how various variables, such as proportion of women or inflation-adjusted median salary, have changed over time for each major. This could be done using either [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) or [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html).\n- Make visualizations to compare the types of jobs (jobs which do or do not require a college degree, low wage service jobs) the recent graduates have between different major categories and between majority-male/majority-female majors.\n- Produce hexbin plots to visualize columns which had dense scatterplots."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

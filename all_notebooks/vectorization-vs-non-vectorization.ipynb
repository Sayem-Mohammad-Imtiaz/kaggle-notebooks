Both are 10 million dimensional matrices.\n* The first way is **for loop** that is non-vectorized implementation.\n* The second way is **np.dot()** that is vectorized implementation.\n* The expected result is vectorized implementation becomes faster than non-vectorized implementation.\n* Why time is important? Because,in todays world data can be very huge and implementation time very important. Nobody wants to wait too much time.\n* What is too much time? While implementation process can take days in deep learning.\n* Lets try and comprare two implementations\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"934e42fa-6561-476e-9d1b-9087e48845d2","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2af9e2bcba37f6ffb418ff3c2f6f22567aff70b9","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport time\n# Two matrices with 10 million dimensions\na = np.random.rand(10000000)\nb = np.random.rand(10000000)\n# Vectorized\ntic = time.time()\nc = np.dot(a,b)\ntoc = time.time()\nprint('Vectorized version calculation result: ',c)\nprint('Vectorized version process time: '+ str((toc-tic)*1000)+ ' ms')\n# Non-vectorized\nc = 0\ntic = time.time()\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    c += a[i]*b[i]\ntoc = time.time()\nprint('Non-vectorized version calculation result: ',c)\nprint('Non-vectorized version process time: '+ str((toc-tic)*1000)+ ' ms')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"974dbfc4a8ef135f92932c65309f640ac994f361","_cell_guid":"3b15d456-d522-428c-8093-4f81fdb63217"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n* When I use vectorized version, time was almost 5 ms\n* When I use non-vectorized version time was almost 5 s\n* Non-vectorized version is 1000 times longer than vectorized version.\n* Can I wait 5 s instead of 5 ms ?

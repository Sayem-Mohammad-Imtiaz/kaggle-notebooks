Sungay, E. Cakti & M.

In this model, lack of conditions that build resiliency is also taken into consideration besides conditions that increase vulnerability. Authors underline the need of a multidisciplinary evaluation of the term risk, and suggest to cover socio-economic fragility and lack of resilience as aggravating factors besides physical risk.\n\nBilling and Madengruber (2006) mention that coping capacity is a key concept in vulnerability assessments. They relate vulnerability and coping capacity as two sides of the same coin. They developed a model to compare coping capacity of the countries. The index they propose, consist of four main indicators; the level of institutional preparedness, level of mitigation measures taken, number of IFRC volunteers, and modified UNDP Disaster Risk Index

identified as two important aspects in the face of an infectious disease pandemic, and they bear a potential impact to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should evaluate the specific components of these indices that exert the greatest impact on pandemic control. https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(20)30337-6/fulltext\n\nIMMUNIZATIONS\n\nThe essence of routine immunization is to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. If you focus solely on COVID-19 and forget about other diseases, you create opportunities for more outbreaks to emerge\" \"The moment you lose sight of routine immunization you create serious problems in the health system\"- Emmanuel Lansana.

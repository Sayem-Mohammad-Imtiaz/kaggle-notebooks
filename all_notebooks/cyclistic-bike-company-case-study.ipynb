Therefore, your\nteam wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these insights, your team\nwill design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve\nyour recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.","metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## STATEMENT OF BUSINESS TASK\n> How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED \n* Python - Modules used: NUMPY,PANDAS,MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN,\n* SQL\n\n## TOOLS USED\n* Pgadmin 4( PostgreSQL tool)- For processing the data for exploration.\n* Jupyter Notebook - For Exploratory Data Analysis and visualzation.\n\nNote: As kaggle does not support SQL, I will not be able to provide SQL queries but detailed documentation of process of creating \"FINAl_DATA.CSV\" is given below.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PROCESSING DATA FOR EXPLORATION\n    \n   - Copied original data into new folder and imported copied data to Pgadmin 4(PostgreSQL Tool). As I can come back to original data if in case I messed the data or data got deleted.\n   - Merged all datasets contaning data from 1 Apr 2020 to 30 Apr 2021 using so that all the data is at one place making it easier and making it less time consuming to perform furthur manipulations on data.\n       \n      ## Cleaning and Transforming the data\n   \n   - Missing values: There are many missing values in the columns start_station_name,end_station_name,start_station_id and end_station_id but they can be neglected as there is no significant role of those columns in analyzing our answer.There were no missing values found in other columns.\n   - Format check:Checked the formats of started_at and ended_at as they contain date and time.\n   - Duplicate Entries: Ensured that the column \"ride_id\" has unique values and there were no repeating entries.\n   - Errors: Ensured that there are no errors in data by querying the data in columns started_at and ended_at to check whether any dates are out of range or any errors such as 30 feb 2020 and in column \"member_casual\" to check whether there are an entries other than member and casual.\n   - Data Manipulation: \n      - Changed the name of column \"member_casual\" to \"rider_type\" to make it more readable.\n      - Added a new column \"ride_length-min\" which is difference between column \"started_at\" and \"ended_at\". The new column tells us about the number of minutes that a rider rode his bike.\n      - Added columns \"start_day\" and \"end_day\" which represents name of the weekDay on which Rider started his ride and ended his ride respectively. \n      - Created New table(\"Final_data.csv\" which is used for data exploration in below python code) from all tripdata which contains columns \"ride_id,rideable_type,started_at, ended_at, start_day, end_day, ride_length_min, and rider_type\".\n      -

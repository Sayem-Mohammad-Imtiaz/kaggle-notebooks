To start,the figure clearly shows that there are far more movies on Netflix compared to TV shows, which, for those who use Netflix, can verify. In addition to this, a vast majority of Netflix entries (both TV shows and Movies) are fairly recent. In the scatterplot above, we can see that a major portion of the points fall within the years 2010 and 2019. This makes sense as Netflix would want to provide its users with more recent entries to keep them interested in its service. However, there are still a great number of entries that were released prior to 2010, especially movies. In fact, we can see a small cluster of movies that were released during the 1940s. If we examine the relationship between the number of Netflix entries (for each type) and the release year, we see two different trends. The number of movies appears to increase as each year progresses. However, for TV shows, the number stays constant and eventually starts to increase after 1980. I find this particularly interesting as television became more popular in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Thus, I would expect Netflix to include more TV shows from that time, but that is clearly not the case."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To see the growth of Netlix entries over the years, I created a lineplot, with the x-axis representing the year and the y-axis representing the number of entries for each year.

Some of the important unsupervised learning algorithms are - Clustering, Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Association Rule learning. In this kernel we will explore Clustering and PCA.

Here, we perform K-means clustering by first deciding the number of clusters='K'. Then we assign each observation to one of these K clusters. The cost function here is the sum of within cluster variation for all the K clusters and our aim is to minimize that. In brief the K-mean algorithm works by first randomly assigning the observations to any of the K-clusters. Then it iterates over the next 2 steps- i). it calculates the centroid for each cluster. A centroid is a vector of mean of p features for all the observations in that particular cluster. ii) then assigning/reassigning the observation to a cluster whose centroid is the nearest to this particular observation. This stops when the results don't change anymore. If we supply new samples, then KMeans remembers the centroids and assign the new samples to the cluster where the centroid is the closest.\nK-means algorithm gets its name from the process of calculating the centroid from the means of the observations in a cluster."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"69dba5ae64ae42888670353d1dc8219fb9e02061"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, we play with KMeans which is implemented in scikit learn.

Then using pandas crosstab function with these columns we can obtain a table.

Inertia is the measure of distance between each observation and its centroid. It determines how compact the cluster is. Lower the value of inertia better the cluster. The best number of clusters for KMeans clustering can be deduced from inertia. For better clustering we prefer lower inertia that means more number of clusters. Thus, we try to achieve a balance between low inertia and the number of clusters. We want inertia to be low enough but don't want the number of clusters to increase so much that we get individual observations as a cluster. Thus, in a plot of inertia vs number of clusters we pick the value for the number of clusters which decreases the inertia but doesn't lead to too many clusters. This is usually the elbow in the plot.

It produces a tree like representation of the data that informs the number of clusters and the observations falling in those clusters. This tree like structure is called a **dendrogram**. Here, we will discuss **agglomerative clustering** which is indicated by an upside down tree. As we move up this tree, leaves start to fuse/merge together into braches indicating that these are similar observations. As we move higher up, braches or banches and leaves start merging. The sooner these leaves/branches merge, more similar these observations are. Those observations that merge later, are quite different from each other. The height at which these observations merge indicate how different these observations are. When we are at the bottom of the upside down tree, it is easier to determine if 2 observations are similar enough to merge but as we climb up, we now have to merge clusters. So, how do we determine if the 2 clusters are similar or dissmilar? Here comes the concept of linkage. \n### Linkage\nIt defines dissmilarity between 2 clusters. Linkage can be of four types-\ni) **Complete Linkage**- This defines maximal dissimilarity between the clusters.This computes pairwise dissmilarity between the 2 clusters and records the largest dissmilarity.\nii) **Single Linkage**- It is opposite of Complete Linkage. Unlike Complete linkage, it defines minimal dissimilarity between the linkage and keeps the smallest dissmilarity between the 2 clusters.\niii) **Average Linkage**- This defines mean intercluster dissimilarity. It keeps the average of all dissimilarities.\niv). **Centroid Linkage**- As the name indicates, it calculates dissimilarity between centroids of the 2 clusters\nAverage and Complete Linkage are the most commonly used Linkage types. But needless to say, that the choice of clustering depends upon the question in hand.

It is an unsupervised learning approach as it doesn't employ usage of the response/labels. PCA is basically a dimension reductionality approach as it can shrink the number of variables to only a handful that defines the most variability in the data. It therefore, finds its use in supervised learning when the number of features is huge and not all of these features are interesting. Apart from deriving useful variables for supervised learning, PCA can be used for unsupervised data exploration.\n\nLets understand how PCA can be useful for unsupervised data exploration. Assume that we have n observations with p features. We can represent this data by a 2-D scatterplot. But if the number of p gets larger then we will need p(p-1)/2 scatterplots. In addition, most likely, each plot can give only a small fraction of the total information provided. Thus, to get a better representation we need to shrink the variable size to a low dimensions which can explain most of the variance and at the same time losing minimal information.\n\nTo explain PCA in a simple way lets assume that we have an p-dimensional dataset i.e., we have p number of features that describe all our observations. Now, imagine if we plot all these observations in this p-dimensional space, then the direction that spans most of the variation in our data gives us the Principal component 1 (PCA1). Then the second direction that spans second most variation in the data gives our Principal component 2 (PCA2) and so on. Thus, by doing this we can pick a few number of directions (that can explain most of the variation in our data) from N-number of dimenions thereby, reducing the dimensionality. This also aids in removing noise as we get rid of the features that do not explain much of variation. Also, I want to point out here that each principal component found is a linear combination of the features present in the original dataset.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f86bffd053086aa2431f092a6c593f7ad7bc9efa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To begin with how to perform PCA, we first need to import PCA .

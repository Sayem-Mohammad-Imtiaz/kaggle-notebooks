However, some patterns can still be found in particular building types when mixed with air temperature variable.\n\nBasically, people in classroom tend to endure a more lower temperature in the cooler side and they feel hotter in a lower temperature compared to other building types. And the people in multifamily housing have a higher threshold temperature value than others.\n\nWhen giving -3 thermal sensation, people in classrooms are at a lower temperature than other two types. A possible explanation may be the fact that there are usually relatively more people in classrooms so that the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher than other places, which keep people from feeling chilled. Another reason may be due to the higher average metobolism rates of the most common occupants in classroom (which are commonly teenagers or young adults) which enable them to endure a lower temperature.\n\nAt the warmer side, it is obvious to see people in multifamily housing can stay comfortable in relatively high temperature. For example, when the temperature has risen up to 28℃, people in multifamily housing tend to give around 1.0 thermal sensation, but such temperature is higher than that where people in classrooms or offices would vote 3.0 thermal sensation. Similar to the circumstances in classrooms, such characteristic may be because space in housing is shared by pretty much less people so the roomy space help occupants feel comfortable even if the actual air temperature is relatively higher than that in other public facilities."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

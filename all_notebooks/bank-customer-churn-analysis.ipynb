Normally, older customers are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n\nBalance— Good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n\nNumOfProducts— Number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\n\nHasCrCard— Whether or not a customer has a credit card.

One of the main reasons for this high level of casualties was the lack of lifeboats on this self-proclaimed \"unsinkable\" ship.\n\nThose that have seen the movie know that some individuals were more likely to survive the sinking (lucky Rose) than others (poor Jack). In this course, you will learn how to apply machine learning techniques to predict a passenger's chance of surviving using Python.\n\nLet's start with loading in the training and testing set into your Python environment. You will use the training set to build your model, and the test set to validate it. The data is stored on the web as csv files; their URLs are already available as character strings in the sample code.

Both test and train are DataFrame objects, the way pandas represent datasets. You can easily explore a DataFrame using the .describe() method. .describe() summarizes the columns/features of the DataFrame, including the count of observations, mean, max and so on. Another useful trick is to look at the dimensions of the DataFrame. This is done by requesting the .shape attribute of your DataFrame object. (ex. your_data.shape)\n\nThe training and test set are already available in the workspace, as train and test.

A simple way to predict heuristically could be: \"majority wins\". This would mean that you will predict every unseen observation to not survive.\n\nTo dive in a little deeper we can perform similar counts and percentage calculations on subsets of the Survived column. For example, maybe gender could play a role as well? You can explore this using the .value_counts() method for a two-way comparison on the number of males and females that survived, with this syntax:\n\ntrain[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'male'].value_counts()\ntrain[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'female'].value_counts()\nTo get proportions, you can again pass in the argument normalize = True to the .value_counts() method."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ed2159581f24aecfbab606ad2f2d0f4902e620e2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Passengers that survived vs passengers that passed away\nprint(\"Survived passengers vs passengers passed away:\\n\" , train[\"Survived\"].value_counts())\n\n# As proportions\nprint(\"Survived passengers vs passengers passed away:\\n\" , train[\"Survived\"].value_counts(normalize=True).round(2))\n\n# Males that survived vs males that passed away\nprint(\"Males survived: \\n\", train[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'male'].value_counts())\n\n# Females that survived vs Females that passed away\nprint(\"Females survived: \\n\",train[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'female'].value_counts())\n\n# Normalized male survival\nprint(\"Males survived: \\n\", train[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'male'].value_counts(normalize=True))\n\n# Normalized female survival\nprint(\"Females survived: \\n\",train[\"Survived\"][train[\"Sex\"] == 'female'].value_counts(normalize=True))\n","execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c80d0900cb789e73ed1e34ef5e098bb4b1714fed"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Does age play a role?\nAnother variable that could influence survival is age; since it's probable that children were saved first. You can test this by creating a new column with a categorical variable Child. Child will take the value 1 in cases where age is less than 18, and a value of 0 in cases where age is greater than or equal to 18.\n\nTo add this new variable you need to do two things (i) create a new column, and (ii) provide the values for each observation (i.e., row) based on the age of the passenger.\n\nAdding a new column with Pandas in Python is easy and can be done via the following syntax:\n\nyour_data[\"new_var\"] = 0\nThis code would create a new column in the train DataFrame titled new_var with 0 for each observation.\n\nTo set the values based on the age of the passenger, you make use of a boolean test inside the square bracket operator. With the []-operator you create a subset of rows and assign a value to a certain variable of that subset of observations. For example,\n\ntrain[\"new_var\"][train[\"Fare\"] > 10] = 1\nwould give a value of 1 to the variable new_var for the subset of passengers whose fares greater than 10. Remember that new_var has a value of 0 for all other values (including missing values).\n\nA new column called Child in the train data frame has been created for you that takes the value NaN for all observations.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n100XP\nSet the values of Child to 1 is the passenger's age is less than 18 years.\nThen assign the value 0 to observations where the passenger is greater than or equal to 18 years in the new Child column.\nCompare the normalized survival rates for those who are <18 and those who are older.

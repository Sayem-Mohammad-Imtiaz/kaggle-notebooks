It appears that you have almost a 50/50 chance of eating a poisonous mushroom if you choose a random mushroom from the wild. \n\nHowever, an interesting next step would be to see if there are certain features that are more likely to be associated with poisonous mushrooms. Could that provide a way to increase the probability of being able to select an edible mushroom, if the random mushroom selected from the wild did not have those features?

We will specifically look at the `fit()` method as this method is used to run our algorithm.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. We first initialize our data points randomly to clusters. The parameter `k` is the number of clusters hyperparameter. Each data point in our dataset is randomly assigned to one of k cluster ids.\n2. We also define a variable `new_clusters` to store the new cluster assignments after the minimum distance between the data point and each cluster is computed.\n3. We now setup an infinite loop using `itertools.count()`. and begin iterating.\n4. The cluster means are computed. Note that if a particular cluster id fails to be randomly assigned to a data point, we take a random data point and assign it to be the mean of that cluster.\n5. We then assign the new clusters to each data point based on the minimum squared euclidean distance between a data point and each cluster means.\n6. Lastly, we check if any of the data points have changed clusters. If they have then we assign the new clusters to serve as the input for computing the cluster means. \n7.

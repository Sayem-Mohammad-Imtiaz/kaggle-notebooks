Right off the bat, I am making the following assumptions just from the headers alone: \n * `state_code` corresponds to one of the 50 states of the US (plus potentially some optional ones like DC, Puerto Rico, Guam, etc).\n * `county_code` is an identifier based on the county the measurement was taken in. Without having seen the data, I assume the county codes are unique (so they won't start counting at 1 for each state). \n * `site_num`probably corresponds to the location where the measurement was made. Like the above 2 columns, I expect I'll need to find some lookup table elsewhere.\n * `parameter_code`is a very generic name, no clue what that is. Guess we'll have to hold off judgement until we get a bit further into the data exploration.\n * `poc` could stand for a number of different things.\n * `latitude` seems fairly self explanatory, the latitude of the measurement site. Only left to find out if it is done in degrees, minutes, seconds, or some decimal version of that.\n * `longitude` similar to above, same question too.\n * `datum` is likely to be a reference point for the `longitude` and `latitude` values (not uncommon when working with GIS information).\n * `parameter_name`, delightfully vague again. Likely to be associated with `parameter_code`. \n * `sample_duration` sounds like how long the measurement was taken for. This could later be a possible source of variance in the data, so good to keep in mind.\n * `pollutant_standard` could mean some form of legislation or a safe limit for the chemical.\n * `date_local` I assume this is a date format. We will likely be sorting and filtering on this value, so we'll take a closer look at this in a bit.\n * `units_of_measurement` likely to be the unit for the actual concentration measured at the site. I'm expecting something like parts per million, parts per billion, or heaven forbid something like mol/liter. Another key thing to note is whether they're all the same, or if we need to keep in mind some entries are done with a different unit.\n * `event_type`, again no idea.\n * `observation_count` sounds like our money variable. This is the actual concentration of CO measured.\n * `observation_percent` looks to be the confidence they have in the measured value, could be related to time of measurement.\n * `arithmetic_mean` is an interesting value. It could be related to the measured variable over the time period it was measured. We'll have to look this up.\n * `first_max_value` sounds like a variable associated with the measurement method.\n * `first_max_hour`, similar to above, it's starting to sound like we are going to need to read a bit about CO measurement methodologies at the EPA.\n * `aqi` stands for air quality index (thank you Google), I wonder if it's related to urban area location or maybe `pollutant_standard`.\n * `method_code` sounds like it relates to how the data was collected.\n * `method_name` sounds like the name associated with `method_code`\n * `local_site_name` sounds like a human readable identifier for `site_num`.\n * `address` this speaks for itself I think, a street address for the location.\n * `state_name` is the human readable version of `state_code`\n * `county_name` is the human readable version of `county_code`\n * `city_name` is the name of the city the measurement was taken.\n * `cbsa_name` is the [core-based statistical area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core-based_statistical_area)\n * `date_of_last_change` is an interesting one. It means the data may have been corrected in some way after the fact."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d32e7f9571a7373ec4219cdaabc683e2ae5b2474","_cell_guid":"fb005038-0028-4576-a1d6-b0cdf4b8f925"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We all know the old adage about what it means to assume.

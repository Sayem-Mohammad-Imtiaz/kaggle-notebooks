Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.\n\nEach of the 21 questions are 4 optioned questions having score from 0 to 3. Minium score being 0 and maximum being 63.The degree of depression is directly proportional to the BDI score\n\nSome of the questions are :\n1. - 0 I do not feel sad\n   - 1 I feel sad\n   - 2 I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it.\n   - 3 I am so sad and unhappy that I can't stand it. \n   \n   \n2. - 0 I am not particularly discouraged about the future.\n   - 1 I feel discouraged about the future.\n   - 2 I feel I have nothing to look forward to.\n   - 3 I feel the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve. \n  \nFor more details on the questions [visit here](https://www.ismanet.org/doctoryourspirit/pdfs/Beck-Depression-Inventory-BDI.pdf)\n\n## BDI Score\nBased on the BDI score, the patient is categorised as follows :\n- Below 10 : These ups and downs are considered normal\n- 11-16    : Mild mood disturbance\n- 17-20    : Borderline clinical depression\n- 21-30    : Moderate depression\n- 31-40    : Severe depression\n- Over 40  : Extreme depression "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Standard Imports"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport

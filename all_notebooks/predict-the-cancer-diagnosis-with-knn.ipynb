In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\nIn k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\nIn k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.\n\nBoth for classification and regression, a useful technique can be used to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n\nThe neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n\n\nLet's grab it and use it!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Let's import libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/breastCancer.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 32'],inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(columns=['id'],inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"set(df['diagnosis'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['diagnosis'] =[ 1 if i =='M' else 0 for i in df['diagnosis']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Visualization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))\nsns.countplot(x= 'diagnosis', data=df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.plot(figsize=(18,8))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12,7))\ndf['smoothness_mean'].hist(bins=30,color='darkred',alpha=0.7)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['perimeter_worst'].hist(color='blue',bins=40,figsize=(8,4))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can figure it out better using data visualization."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Standardize the Variables\n\nThe KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters.

With transfer learning, instead of starting the learning process from scratch, you leverage patterns that have been learned from pre-trained models as features extraction. A pre-trained model is a model that was trained on a large benchmark dataset, typically ImageNet, to solve a problem similar to the one that we want to solve - image classification.\n\nThough less time than building from scratching, using transfer learning to train image classification models can still take a considerable amount of time. In my experience, models can take up to 30-45 minutes per epoch to train when involving large datasets and/or complicated models. This means the more epochs needed to improve the model, the longer overall runtime is needed. So how can we improve the training runtime when implementing transfer learning? We can precalculate the frozen layers then pass those values as the dataset into the training model.\n\nPre-trained models can typically be broken into two parts, a features and fully connected block. The features block is typically frozen and used as features extraction and the fully connected block is reconfigured for the specific dataset being applied and the respective number for classes to be predicted. During the forward and back-propagation steps of the training phase, the data passes through both blocks and the model is updated accordingly decreasing the model's loss function.\n\nThe process of passing all the data through both the feature and fully connected blocks can be improved by precalculcating the data values for the features block. With the calculated features data values, we then need to only iterate through the fully connected blocks to train our model. This kernal provides a walkthrough of how to implement such a strategy using PyTorch."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6c65d37e6bdf10b6ed1306c4237d7d45ab334cc1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Project Imports\nLet's start with importing modules needed for this project."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Porject modules\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nimport time\n\n# PyTorch modules\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn, optim\nfrom torch.nn import functional as F\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import transforms, models, datasets","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Data\nConfigure data augmentation requirements and load image data into memory."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1a5f013faf4b5afbf9cabb6e5b753e7a1e3a9d1b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Useful project constants\nBATCH_SIZE = 24\nTYPES_OF_DATASETS = ['train', 'valid'] # Order matters her for train_model function","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"64576acf606bf3dc7aae3a57360178066d18a466"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data augmentation and normalization for training\n# Just normalization for validation\ndata_transforms = {\n    'train': transforms.Compose([\n        transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n        transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),\n        transforms.ToTensor(),\n        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n    ]),\n    'valid': transforms.Compose([\n        transforms.Resize(256),\n        transforms.CenterCrop(224),\n        transforms.ToTensor(),\n        transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])\n    ]),\n}\n\ndata_dir = '../input/flower_data/flower_data/'\nimage_datasets = {x: datasets.ImageFolder(os.path.join(data_dir, x),\n                                          data_transforms[x])\n                  for x in TYPES_OF_DATASETS}\ndataloaders = {x: torch.utils.data.DataLoader(image_datasets[x], batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,\n                                             shuffle=False)\n              for x in TYPES_OF_DATASETS}\ndataset_sizes = {x: len(image_datasets[x]) for x in TYPES_OF_DATASETS}\nclass_names = image_datasets['train'].classes\n\ndevice = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"68af9a2861e0cbdcbc1ef2f56fa97624d14be77c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Configure Model\nWill be using densenet161 pretrained model for the kernal.

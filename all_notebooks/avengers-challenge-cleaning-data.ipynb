{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The team at FiveThirtyEight wanted to dissect the deaths of the Avengers in the comics over the years. The writers were known to kill off and revive many of the superheroes so they were curious to know what data they could grab from the Marvel Wikia site, a fan-driven community site, to explore further. To learn how they collected their data, which is available on their Github repo, read the writeup they published on their site.\n\nWhile the FiveThirtyEight team has done a wonderful job acquiring this data, the data still has some inconsistencies. Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to clean up their dataset so it can be more useful for analysis in Pandas. First things first: read our dataset into Pandas as a DataFrame and preview the first 5 rows to get a better sense of our data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/avengers/avengers.csv\", encoding = \"latin-1\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers['Year'].hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"avengers[\"Year\"].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nWe only want to keep the Avengers who were introduced after 1960.

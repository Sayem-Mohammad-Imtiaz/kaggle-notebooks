The common metrics to measure association are-\n1. Support- It is the measure of frequency or abundance of an item in a dataset. It can be 'antecedent support', 'consequent support', and 'support'. 'antecedent support' contains proportion of transactions done for the antecedent while 'consequent support' involves  those for consequent. 'Support' is computed for both antecedent and consequent in question.\n2. Confidence-This gives the probability of consequent in a transaction given the presence of antecedent.\n3. Lift- Given that antecedents and consequents are independent, how often do they come together/bought together.\n4. Leverage- It is the difference between frequency of antecedent and consequent together in transactions to frequency of both in independent transactions.\n5.Conviction- A higher conviction score means that consequent is highly dependent on antecedent.\n\nApriori algorithm is used to extract frequent itemsets that are further used for association rule analysis. In this algorithm, user defines a minimum support that is the minimum threshold that decides if an itemset is considered as 'frequent'.

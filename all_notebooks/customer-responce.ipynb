to increase revenue.  \nData is simulated data from [StarBucks](https://starbucks.com).  \n\nData Dictionary:  \n\nprofile.csv\n\nRewards program users (17000 users x 5 fields)\n\n    gender: (categorical) M, F, O, or null\n    age: (numeric) missing value encoded as 118\n    id: (string/hash)\n    became_member_on: (date) format YYYYMMDD\n    income: (numeric)\n\nportfolio.csv\n\nOffers sent during 30-day test period (10 offers x 6 fields)\n\n    reward: (numeric) money awarded for the amount spent\n    channels: (list) web, email, mobile, social\n    difficulty: (numeric) money required to be spent to receive reward\n    duration: (numeric) time for offer to be open, in days\n    offer_type: (string) bogo, discount, informational\n    id: (string/hash)\n\ntranscript.csv\n\nEvent log (306648 events x 4 fields)\n\n    person: (string/hash)\n    event: (string) offer received, offer viewed, transaction, offer completed\n    value: (dictionary) different values depending on event type\n        offer id: (string/hash) not associated with any \"transaction\"\n        amount: (numeric) money spent in \"transaction\"\n        reward: (numeric) money gained from \"offer completed\"\n    time: (numeric) hours after start of test\n\n\n## Problem Statement  \nThe problem is how do we know if an offer is sutable for a customer or not? to keep it simple we will use the 'offer copleted' event as an indicator that a customer is happy with the offer they got, and for offers that don't have a completion condition such as informitive offers the 'offer viewd' will indicate that a customer is happy (even though spending changes after reciving the informitive offer are better indecator of customer's responce).  \n\n## Metrics  \nSince it is a classification problem both precision and accuracy will be used to judge the model performance.\n\n\n\n\n[Github

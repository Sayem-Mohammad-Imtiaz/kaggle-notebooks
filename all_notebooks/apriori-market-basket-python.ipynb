There are three common ways to measure association.\n\nMeasure 1: Support. This says how popular an itemset is, it is number of times appear in total number of transaction. in other word we say frequency of item.\n\nMeasure 2: Confidence. This says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.\n\nMeasure 3: Lift. it is ratio of expected confidance to observed confidance. it is described as confidance of Y when item X was already known(x/y) to the confidance of Y when X item is unknown. in other words confidance of Y w.r.t. x and confiadnce of Y without X (means both are independent to each other).\n    \nReference: https://www.kaggle.com/yugagrawal95/market-basket-analysis-apriori-in-python","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"itemsets = apriori(data_hot_encoded,use_colnames=True, min_support=0.05)\nitemsets = itemsets.sort_values(by=\"support\" , ascending=False) \n\nfrequent_itemsets = apriori(data_hot_encoded, min_support=0.05, use_colnames=True)\nfrequent_itemsets['length'] = frequent_itemsets['itemsets'].apply(lambda x: len(x))\nfrequent_itemsets","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nrules =  association_rules(itemsets, metric='lift', min_threshold=1)\n\nrules = rules.sort_values(by=\"lift\" , ascending=False) \n#rules.to_csv('./rules.csv')\nprint('-'*20, 'association rules', '-'*20)\nprint(rules)\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

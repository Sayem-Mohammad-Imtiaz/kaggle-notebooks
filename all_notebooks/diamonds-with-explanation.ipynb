I see in Kaggle many people throw more sophisticated tools at every problem, but I think here it is not needed, as regression does a good job. At least from the reading, more sophisticated algorithms are needed when concrete issues in the model cannot be captured well by simple methods, but I didnt identify such issues here.\n\nLet us discuss whether linear regression assumptions are met here. The most delicate assumption is about normal distributioin of additive error of the target variable. (linearity and homoscedacity will be seen from visualizations). Note that, unlike what many people do in their kernels, target variable or dependent variables do not have to be normally distributed!\n\nLet us think how is the noice in the price obtained. The seller of diamonds has some price in her mind, and depending on client's negotiating skills she may add or reduce up to 10-20% of the price. This is our noise, which we can assume is normally distributed(supposedly, distribution of good and bad negotiators is normal). However, this error is not additive, but multiplicative! By adding 20% to the price, we actually multiply the price by 1.2. In other words, for more expensive diamonds the error will usually be bigger, so linear regression will be more sensitive to noise in the high price range. Therefore, in order to apply linear regression,  we must take log of the price (which will transform multiplicative error to additice). We will see other indicators why that will be a good choice.

It would be more meaningful, if one could determine the price up to 10% error. Hence, we will try to minimize the error in terms of % of price.

Also, our prediction has standard deviation of seems to miss the real price by at most $\\pm 25\\%$, and we saw from simple visualization that we certainly can not expect prediction with less than $15 \\%$ error, so I feel like the result is not too bad. Moreover, the sample we took of diamonds with most common features, we saw that price distribution is slightly skewed and does not completely look like normal distribution, so it is not unreasonable that our residual error is not exactly normally distributed. Overall, residual error graph looks good to me. We also saw that training and test scores were quite similar, so there is not much evidence for over/underfitting."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Final test\nPrepare the test data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"final_data.cut = final_data.cut.map(cut_dict)\nfinal_data.clarity = final_data.clarity.map(clarity_dict)\nfinal_data.color = final_data.color.map(color_dict)\nfinal_data['new_cut']  = clf.predict(final_data[['table', 'depth']])\nfinal_data['volume'] = final_data.x*final_data.y*final_data.z\nfinal_data['area'] = final_data.x*final_data.y\nfinal_data['root_carat'] = np.sqrt(final_data.carat)\nfinal_data = final_data.drop(['Unnamed: 0', 'table', 'depth'], axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"linreg = LinearRegression()\nlinreg.fit(X,y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.title('Residual graph')\nplt.scatter(final_result.values, 100*(final_result.values - np.expm1(lr.predict(final_data)))/final_result.values)\nplt.ylim(-100,100)\nplt.ylabel('Error in % of the price')\nplt.xlabel('Real price')\nx = [50 * i for i in range(380) ]\nplt.plot(x,[0]*380, color = 'red')\nprint('Regression score:', lr.score(final_data, np.log1p(final_result.values)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"****I like that regression score is consistent on data that was previously unseen, so the model is likely to generalize well."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## P.S.\nI am new in ML and this is my first kernel.

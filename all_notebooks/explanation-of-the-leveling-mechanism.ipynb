summarized rules are as the following:\n\n*  The level of each user for each content starts at 0.\n*  The user has to complete enough problems under a certain content to raise the level.\n*  Correctly answering 5 problems in a row of 6 problems will raise the level for the content from 0 to 1.\n*  After level 1 until the exercise is Proficient (level 4)\n   *  Continously correct in answering 2 problems  -> Upgrade.\n   *  Continously wrong in answering 2 problems    -> Downgrade.\n   *  One correct and one wrong attempt            -> No level change is made and we let the user try again.\n*  There are time interval restrictions between upgrades as shown in the previous notebook for upgrades after reaching level 1.\n\nThe *is_downgrade* column will be False and *is_upgrade* column will be True whenever upgrade, and vice versa.\n\nThe *is_downgrade* and the *is_upgrade* column may be Null at the same time when the user has not answered enough problems to upgrade or downgrade or is still

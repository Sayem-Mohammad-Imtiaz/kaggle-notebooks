The pandemic threatens to reverse it. \n\nBOGOT, Colombia — The pandemic came , they loose jobs. Some are evicted, forced to move to sheds in an illegal settlement atop the city. A life of efforts had vanished in a matter of weeks.\n\nNot long ago, Colombia—and Latin America in general—was in the midst of a historic transformation: the scourge of inequality was shrinking like never before. Over the past 20 years, millions of families have risen out of poverty in one of the most unequal regions on the planet. The gap between rich and poor in Latin America fell to the lowest record.\n\nNow, the pandemic threatens to reverse those achievements like no other phenomenon in recent history, economists say, which can potentially drastically change politics and entire societies in the coming years.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/es/2020/07/11/espanol/america-latina/desigualdad-coronavirus-america-latina-colombia.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/world/11colombiaroadtrip-ES-2/00colombiaroadtrip-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp)\nLiving in sheds, Colombia NYT- Photographs by Federico Rios ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

During this international emergency, the children they support are more at risk than ever. All of the children and young people our partners work with come from economically precarious families who rely on informal employment to survive, with little to no savings and living each day hand to mouth. During the lockdown they cannot go to work and receive their daily income, which has made covering the rent, food and toiletries extremely difficult.https://www.childrenchangecolombia.org/news/335/35/Help-Colombia-Covid-19","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata  @mpwolke ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

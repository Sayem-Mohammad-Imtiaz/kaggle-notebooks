A little insight about Rate My Professor website, it is a website that contains a rating of school, professors and universities. You can search for any professor or school and get their ratings before taking or joining to their courses. It’s a handy feature which helps to know more about your professor or the university that you want to join. In this tutorial, we shall see how to scrape and to extract a specific professor’s tag. I warn you guys this is not illegal but the mass scraping of data from the website can lead your IP address being blocked. Just do it once or twice, but don’t just foolishly put it in a loop and try to put request inside the loop.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"teMB0jnMELj2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![alt text](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/575/5ac80d20dfc1e.image.jpg)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"TESiRp8VE44M"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What is Web Scraping ?**\n\nWeb Scraping (also termed as Scraping, Data Extraction, Data Harvesting, etc.) is a technique used to extract data from the websites.

One important thing in this tutorial there is no point of me explaining each and every line of code, which is not needed here because python code is self-explanatory. However, I will try not to confuse you, and make things clear in an easy way. So I wrote this tutorial in such a way that everybody can understand irrespective of their programming background. Moreover, the entire source code can be found in my GitHub.

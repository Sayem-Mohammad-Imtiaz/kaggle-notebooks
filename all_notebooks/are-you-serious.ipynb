(no really are you..?)**\n   \n\nIn this notebook I am going to look into the different techiques to see if we can predict whether or not a comment is being sarcastic.\n\nFor this I will be using the Sarcasm On Reddit data set.  The dataset I will be using will be approximately 1.3 million comments.  Approximately half of these are labeld as sarcastic (the user specified the \\s flag in reddit to indicate they were being actually sarcastic) and the other hald is not sarcastic.\n\nAside from the intial comment, we also have the following features which we can use\n* subject being discussed\n* author of the original comment\n* follow up reply comment from another (unspecified) reddit user\n\n1. We will start by doing some initial statistical analysis to see if certain authors or subjects lean to being more sarcastic.\nWe will then do some basic ngram analysis and wordBubbles to see if there are certain phrases that are very prevalent in sarcastic and non sarcastic comments.\n\n1. We will then train a model just using the comment to see how well we can predict if another comment is sarcastic enought.\n\n1. We will then see if we can improve that prediction by factoring in the author and the subject being discussed (which really are just weightings)\n\n1. Finally we will look into how well the model (trasined just on the comments) detetcts sarcasm in a non reddit context (assuming I can get some reliable data for this)\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4a0f8f611e1d73ac490423677ec5e661fb900903"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Part one - reading in data and some basic statistical analysis**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we use pandas to read in the balanced dataset into a panda dataframe\nSecondly we split that dataframe into two sets where one is sarcastic and one is not sarcastic","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d596bd673797449f9601fbf9c57970a39128d807"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataframe = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train-balanced-sarcasm.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b63ad5fd620b9a1a690ad4d1829fc18c47729e09"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# allows us to take a look at some of the data\ndataframe.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"dfdba1878365609621c9c54bd7fbeb5b953a9e7e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# tells you how many values in each column\ndataframe.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ca0e71f21d563887998bd27f7691517d941ceb35"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# simply shows the number of rows and columns in your data set\ndataframe.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3fd6bf4cc16617606f8c3f3f83d85fdfe8d9907e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# displays the total number of rows for each value of label (in this case 0 and 1)\ndataframe['label'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"aaedacb7865aa42d5bc41678717ccba23200373e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Its balanced as we can see we have 505413 results assigned to both the sarcastic and non-sarcastic labels","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"227f36acd5603be636786ab46e0f092d53ebd56a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# now we split these out into two sets, sarc and notsarc\nnotsarc = dataframe[dataframe['label'] == 0]\nsarc = dataframe[dataframe['label'] == 1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sarc['comment']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bf5feda2fd9e15682f19cf4bc1e2afc76e6a85fa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sarc['subreddit'].value_counts().head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"9b95fb353edce348b7510132774f46e130456f24"},"cell_type":"code","source":"notsarc['subreddit'].value_counts().head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f57110c9d8de947357b00f32ce208b5aa323d5d4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataframe['subreddit'].value_counts().head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"53fd5b5d079bfb940ee8fbc7d600df300e73bb01"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"85b381c4ea3a8696e20aba540bf84b4868aa7f1f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ok, just looking straight at the comments in this way doesn't take into account the volume of comments.

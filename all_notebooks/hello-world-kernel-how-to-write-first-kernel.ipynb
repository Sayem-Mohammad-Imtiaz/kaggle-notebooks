My Background**\n\nI have already known about programming, algorithm structures and started learning Python two years ago. Then I could not achieve being sustainable to study. I failed in Python. Later I uploaded Anaconda.  And here we are again. This is the milestone for my Data Science career.\n\n*Thanks to Datai Team on Udemy!*\n\nI learned some basics until now like:\n\n* Python Syntax (data types, functions, loops)\n* Skills of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries \n* Basics of Data Science (Data Implementing & Filtering)\n* Introduction to Kaggle \n\n\n**2. Dataset**\n\nI will use [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) in this Kernel.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First look in data.

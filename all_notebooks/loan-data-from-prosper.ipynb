How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\n>From the above four plots that is boxplot,histogram and pointplot I have gather some points which are discussed below:<br>\n- Loan status- \"Completed\" has the lowest APR (approx. 0.02). Also, median of APR for \"completed\" variable is approx. 0.2 which is still the lowest. Moreover, most of the APR values lie between first quertile (approx. 0.14 APR) and second quertile (approx. 0.20 APR). However, maximum APR lie just above 0.4.<br>\n- Loan Status- \"Current\" variable's median is approx. 0.22 APR which is second lowest after \"Completed\" loan status. Lowest APR is approx. 0.05 and highest APR is 0.36. Distribution is left skewed a little bit. From violin plot we can see that most of the APR values lie between first quartile and second quartile ranging from approx. 0.13 to 0.23. Also, data is unimodal having one peak. <br>\n- Loan Status- \"Past Due (1-15 days)\" Distribution is left skewed with lowest whisker length extends to approx. 0.08 APR and maximum whisker length extends to approx. 0.38. Median is approx. 0.26 and data is slightly unimodal having one peak.<br>\n- Loan Status- \"Defaulted\" Distribution is left skewed and data is unimodal having one peak. Minimum APR is approx. 0.03 and maximum APR is approx. 0.42. Desnity of APR is greatest between 0.23 and 0.32 APR values and nearly equal number of APR values lie between first quartile and median as compare to count of APR values between second quartile and third quartile.<br>\n- Loan Status- 'Chargedoff', 'Past Due (16-30 days)', 'Past Due (61-90 days)','Past Due (31-60 days)', 'Past Due (91-120 days)' Distribution is left skewed and data is unimodal. Minimum value is approx. 0.03,0.07, 0.07, 0.06, 0.08 respectively. Maximum value is approx. 0.43 (greatest APR), 0.36,0.36,0.36,0.38 respectively. Median is approx 0.27,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.28 respectively.<br>\n- Loan Status- 'FinalPaymentInProgress', 'Past Due (>120 days)', 'Cancelled' Distribution for 'FinalPaymentInProgress' is left skewed and data is unimodal with only one peak. For 'Past Due (>120 days)' variable, distribution is left skewed but data is multimodal having multiple peaks. Data in 'Past Due (>120 days)' seems to be less compared to other features. This could mean that very few borrowers who took loans had loan status of 'Past Due (>120 days)'. On the other hand, \"cancelled\" variable had only one value which is approx. 0.18 APR which means only one borrowers's loan was cancelled. \n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\n\n> Some Loan status have high APR values and one loan status is cancelled with APR value of 0.18 approx. So, I will try to find why some loan status have high APR. Also, what features are responsible for high APR of loan status.

From above hist2d I have made several observations:<br>\n> 1- For 'Term' = 12, loan status 'Complete' has maximum data points with most of the Borrower APR less than 0.2 between 1000 and 5000 loan amount. Also, loan status of 'current' and 'charged off' have some points with 'current' having 'cloud' of points above 0.2 debt to income ratio and 'chargedoff' having 'cloud' of points below 0.2 debt to income ratio. Rest of the loan status either have very few data or no data at all for term 12.<br>\n>2- For 'Term' = 36, every loan status have some amount of data available with 'complete' having the maximum data for giving debt to income ratio and loan original amount. Also, I observed that loan status which have very less or no data available for term-12 are having some amount of data. This means that borrowers who took loan for 36 months term with debt to income ratio of greater than 0.2 are more likely to have loan status of 'past due', 'default', 'chargeoff'.<br>\n>3- For 'Term' = 60, I observed that many borrowers have taken large amount compare to terms 12 and 36 and those who took loan between 10000-15000 are more likely to have high debt to income ratio.<br><br>\n> Hence, loan amount,term,and debt to income ratio does play an important role in deciding the loan status.

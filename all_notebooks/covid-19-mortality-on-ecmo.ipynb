There are two forms of ECMO: veno-venous (VV) typically used in cases of severe respiratory failure, and veno-arterial (VA) or veno-venous-arterial (VVA) for patients with cardiogenic shock.\n\nIn VV ECMO, blood is extracted from the vena cava or right atrium and returned to the right atrium. This form of ECMO provides respiratory support, but not hemodynamic support, and is used for patients with acute respiratory failure. By replacing the gas exchange function of the lungs, ECMO facilitates protective mechanical ventilation as oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance are provided by the extracorporeal circuit. This decreases the magnitude of ventilator-induced lung injury secondary to volutrauma, barotrauma and oxygen toxicity.\n\nECMO therapy is associated with potentially severe side effects. These include bleeding and vascular complications, an increased risk of nosocomial infections and poor neurological outcomes.https://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/10.2217/fca-2020-0040"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/model-answers/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation_(ECMO)_outcomes.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"px.histogram(df, x='question', color='answer')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"px.histogram(df, x='end_score', color='start_score')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Use of ECMO in previous outbreaks of viral respiratory syndromes\n\nThe Extracorporeal Life Support Organisation Registry is an ongoing registry on patients who have been on ECMO support. From these data, 926 adult patients with viral pneumonia of any cause showed an overall survival of 65% with an average duration on ECMO use of 13.5 days.\n\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, almost a third of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) were supported by ECMO therapy . Various case series reported a trend toward a decrease in mortality in those who received ECMO therapy. An Italian cohort reported a 68% survival to hospital discharge in 61 patients receiving ECMO during the H1N1 influenza A pandemic.\n\nAnalysing 35 MERS-CoV patients in ICUs with refractory respiratory failure, those who were treated with ECMO had significantly lower in-hospital mortality (65 vs 100%; p = 0.02), compared with those who received conventional therapy. This was also associated with a longer ICU stay (25 vs 8 days; p = 0.001). Of the 21 patients who died, five (14%) died due to uncontrolled hemorrhage and nine (26%) of septic shock.

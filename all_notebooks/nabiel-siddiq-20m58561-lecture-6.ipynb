Brazil is the second country with highest death toll due to Covid-19 with around 2000 daily deaths. Daily new cases in Brazil is also still showing an upward trend. \n\nFortunately, it has been followed by increasing trend of vaccination albeit still too low in terms of quantity to provide nationwide effect to the Corona spreading. In fact, up to now, there is only 9.9 people/hundred of population get vaccinated in Brazil, lagging behind Cambodia and one of its neighbouring country Chile. The government could not also increase the vaccination further because it is running out of vaccine stock. This primarily caused by the previous government policy that was reluctant to buy vaccine from certain countries with only basing the decision on perceptions.\n\nCurrently, the government of Brazil is trying to produce the vaccine in-house (licensed by CoronaVac, China). However, many news articles mentioned that the 'active' ingredients of the vaccine is getting more limited and must be imported from China.\n\nReferences\n(https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210516-brazil-struggles-with-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-as-death-toll-spirals)\n(https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-cuts-number-vaccines-expected-be-delivered-by-30-2021-04-24/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"End of code.\nThank you sensei.","metadata":{}}]}

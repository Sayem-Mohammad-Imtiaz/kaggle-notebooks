Thanks for the interesting and complete dataset you provided.\n2.  I wanted to ask if it was ok for you to add a secondary file to this dataset that i created.\n\nIn the next cell i load a file called \"Did-Not-Participate-1976-to-2008.csv\", it is a csv file that contains only 2 columns.\n* the first one contains the name of all the countries that are present in the original csv you provided.\n* the second one contains all the year where the corresponding country didn't participate to the olympics.\n\nI did this because for question 10 I wanted to know the average number of medals won by all the countries.\n\n**But** countries that won a decent number of medals in a single olympic and then never again would show better than they should in the rankings because the original dataset contains lines only for winning athletes.\n\n**So** the solution was to create all the countries in the \"Country\" column from the dataset and saying that if a country belongs to this column but there is no corresponding line for all the 9 olympics then it means that in some olympics the country won 0 medals.\n\nThat does mean that the average got fairer but there was still a problem, many countries didn't participate to all the olympics!\n\n* The fall of the Soviet Union\n* The unification of Germany\n* The dissolution of Yugoslavia\n* The split of Czechoslovakia\n* The african boycott of the 1976 olympics\n* The american boycott of the 1980 olympics\n* The soviet boycott of the 1984 olympics\n* The Unified Team and Independent Olympic Participants of the 1992 olympics\n\nAnd i'm sure i forgot some...\n\nAs such i created the new csv by checking for every country that appears in the original dataset on Wikipedia which years they didn't send any athletes to the olympics."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#initialization

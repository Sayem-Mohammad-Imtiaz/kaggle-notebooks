As an investor, anyone would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this.\n\nThe problem at hand is to predict the people who have high probablity of paying back the money as comapred to those who dont. Since it is a classification problem, a good way to approach it is by Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithm"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Details\n\nThe dataset consists of the following columns:\n\n- credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise\n- purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values \"credit_card\", \"debt_consolidation\", \"educational\", \"major_purchase\", \"small_business\", and \"all_other\")\n- int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates\n- installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded\n- log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower\n- dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income)\n- fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower\n- days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line\n- revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle)\n- revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available)\n- inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months\n- delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years\n- pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments)\n- no.fully.paid: This is the column that we are trying to predict.

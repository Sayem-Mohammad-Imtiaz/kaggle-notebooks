We have an idea of how strong they are based on certain stats, but what if a new Pokemon is discovered, what type (or types) should it be designated. These are the hard questions Professor Oak and others like him have to deal with with new discoveries. \n\nAn overview of the data for those who aren't as familiar with the games (i.e. me):\n\n* \\# : ID for each pokemon\n* Name: Name of each pokemon\n* Type 1: Each pokemon has a type, this determines weakness/resistance to attacks\n* Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2\n* Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is\n* HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting\n* Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)\n* Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks\n* SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)\n* SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks\n* Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4445e13c-6411-8c0e-8684-47fd4cbf8967"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sn\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"217ec77f-d356-abae-ca0b-cba30284abb6"},"outputs":[],"source":"poke = pd.read_csv('../input/Pokemon.csv')\n\nprint (poke.sample(20))\nprint (\"===============================================\")\nprint (poke.dtypes)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e6b154fc-0100-eedf-82ee-fafd0c30c507"},"source":"Our data has an interesting and convenient structure.

That may be grounds for dropping the column from the data (or at least not dealing with it for now). Also, roughly 8% of them are legendary types. I am however curious about the distribution of primary types and secondary types for the Pokemon who have both, however. I am also going to create a Dual column with a 1 indicating dual type and 0 otherwise in the meantime. First I will need to reincode the Type 2 column.

In fact, this sampling method doesn't seem to perform better than simple random sampling.\n\n\n\n\nThe poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n\n\nIt makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played.

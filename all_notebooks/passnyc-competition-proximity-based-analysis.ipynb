Realistically, increasing testing diversity should increase the specialized high school diversity; however, these schools recruit solely based on test scores. Providing unprepared students with the opportunity to take the exam would result in higher rejection rates. \n\nTop-quality schools extensively prepare their students to take this exam throughout their education. Therefore,  helping more students to register to take the exam would most likely result in very little change. Moreover, the demographics of the test takers are shown to be relatively diverse. Due to the nature of standardized testing and the strict admittance criteria, white and asian students who are more prepared are accepted at higher rates, which mitigates the potential for diversity in specialized schools. \n\nOverall, the solution is to find balance between providing marginalized schools the opportunity to start registering students for the exam, and tutoring students who might be close to already being admitted into a specialized school. In one case, new schools are introduced into the testing pools, but the students will most likely not succeed with sufficient preparation; in the other case, students already intending to take the test might improve their ability to score well, but testing demographics would not change too much. \n\nThere are countless ways to begin increasing the diversity of eight specialized high schools. Due to the reasonable diversity of testing, yet lack of diversity in acceptance rates, it is apparent that schools registering mostly blacks and hispanics to take the exam do not have the resources to properly prepare them. Therefore, the targeted schools from this study will adhere to a small number of attributes: proximity to specialized high schools, percentage Hispanic and Black, and student size. \n\nThere are other factors that will be examined to provide information about a specific school's performance, but proximity, demographics, and size are most important. Students already attending schools nearby specialized high schools would not need to adapt to a new neighborhood, and their commute will not be too far to the specialized high schools. Additionally, as an untested program, it is more reasonable to experiment with the effectiveness of tutoring programs by offering services to larger schools. These programs could start up quickly, and utilize feedback received by interviewing students or possibly maintaining anonymous test results. This approach aims to equalize the acceptance rates between demographics, rather than blindly equalize the testing demographics, which are reasonably representative of the NYC student population. \n\nBy minimizing deployment time and focusing on a few large schools, hopefully the PASSNYC team can develop a viable program eventually offered to a profusion of underserved students."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4b1eb7806a44fd7f24b26d6357a922b8eab5f00"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9e7ba52391a5463e87219c3c62107f22fcec56c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[Jump to Table of Contents](#contents)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"da537d53fe3bfe23e53f9590011b79058ca4a824"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='imports'></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ebbf07abe468f3f747f9409072819c83aca07222"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports and Configs\n***"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"184eead9cd7a7e8225406bd6ce92ed6e6600125b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import datasets, linear_model\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom scipy import stats\n\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\nimport folium\nimport ast\n\npd.options.display.max_rows = 4000\npd.options.display.max_columns = 4000\npd.options.display.max_seq_items = 2000","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6b7b34248d1477bd0b45e6a9aa18f5f7975240aa"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[Jump to Table of Contents](#contents)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0d32c1b8a7f38ce674e980ae421e322e1a233f8a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='data'></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ab2a3b867de0021d826dbe56b5dfeb4f14082261"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e32a4c5a5c2951cef40bcde3d79b6f7f1eeacf77"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This section begins by generalizing the data provided in the '2016 School Explorer' CSV.

However, due to this correlation, finding a school that is deserving of PASSNYC's services should not be difficult. Picking a school with a high percentage of black and hispanic students would normally mean that the school needs extra services. Realistically, the only thing left to do is find a school with students that would be open to attending a specialized high school. \n\n\nFor the three proposals below, three different approaches are used to filter the list of schools. The filtered list is then plotted on the maps.\n\nThe considered categories within the different maps are:\n- Economic Need Index\n- Percent Black / Hispanic\n- Grade 8 Math - All Students Tested\n- School Income Estimate"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"57c3e770329236b75cc8e9a9db15cbf3788b7d35"},"cell_type":"code","source":"high_qualifiers = ['Economic Need Index', ]\nlow_qualifiers = ['School Income Estimate ($)']\n\nhigh_percentile = .5\nlow_percentile = .2\n\ndef filter_df_col(df, col, greater_flag):\n    if greater_flag == True:\n        df = df.loc[df[col] > target_cols.quantile(q=high_percentile, axis='rows', numeric_only=True)[col]]\n    else:\n        df = df.loc[df[col] < target_cols.quantile(q=low_percentile, axis='rows', numeric_only=True)[col]]\n    return df\n\nfiltered_targets1 = target_cols.copy()\n\nfor col in high_qualifiers:\n    filtered_targets1 = filter_df_col(filtered_targets1, col, True)\n    \nfor col in low_qualifiers:\n    filtered_targets1 = filter_df_col(filtered_targets1, col, False)\n    \nfiltered_targets1.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"40b9fd2a9cb96af6b8ee352e28dcf20a2eb2fe54"},"cell_type":"code","source":"color_threshold = .7\n\nthis_map = folium.Map(prefer_canvas=True, tiles='Stamen Toner')\n    \ndef plotTargets(point):\n    '''input: series that contains a numeric named latitude and a numeric named longitude\n    this function creates a CircleMarker and adds it to your this_map'''\n    percent_black_hispanic = point['Percent Black / Hispanic']\n    x = point['School Name'] + '<br>' + \\\n        \"Highest Grade: \" + str(point['Grade High']) + '<br>' + \\\n        \"Grade 8 Students: \" + str(point['Grade 8 Math -

We'll use a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) to model the likelihood of observing the number of killings given the number of people in a certain group (state or race).  \n\nA Poisson distribution models the likelihood of observing some number of events ($k$ events) within a set time window, given the constant (or expected) rate for which they are thought to occur ($\\lambda$ events per time window).  We want to know the likelihood of the number of police killings of people from a given state or of a given race, so we'll set the $\\lambda$ parameter to be the number of individuals in a certain population (race or state) which we would expect to be killed by police given the national average, and find the probability at $k=$ the number of people killed by police in that population.   If police killings don't depend on state or race, then the number of people killed by police in that population ($k$) should be proportional to the population ($\\lambda$).  The further $k$ is from $\\lambda$, the less likely it is that police killlings are biased in that population.\n\nBut we don't just want to find the *likelihood* that police killings are biased in different populations, we also want to know the *direction* in which they are biased.  That is, are there more or less police killings of people in a certian population than would be expected in that population if killings were random?  Therefore, we'll use the cumulative probability of the Poisson distribution, which will tell us the likelihood of observing a given number of killings *or less*.  That way, if the value of the cumulative poisson distribution is closer to 0, that means there were less killings of a certain population than would be expected if killings were random.  If the value is closer to 1, there were more killings than would be expected if killings were random.  And if the value is around 0.5, police shootings of people in that population were relatively unbiased.\n\nThe cumulative probability of the Poisson distribution can be computed by:\n\n$$\np(X \\leq k) = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\left \\lfloor{k}\\right \\rfloor} \\frac{\\lambda^i}{i !}\n$$\n\nwhere again $k$ is the number of observed killings and $\\lambda$ is the expected number of killings if killings were random (given the population distribution).\n\nIf there are $N_p$ individuals in a population, $N_k$ people shot and killed by police in the USA, and $N_{USA}$ people in the USA, we would expect to see, on average,\n\n$$\n\\lambda = N_p \\frac{N_k}{N_{USA}}\n$$\n\npeople in that population shot by police if shootings were random.

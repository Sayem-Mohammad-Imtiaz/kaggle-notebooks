(thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect) https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/thalassemia/facts.html\n\n**CA:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosop, in this variable is the same, is expected to have a positive correcation between the contidtion and ca, in this dataset is correct, I mean if you have more vassels discovered in the study is totally clear you will increase the likelihood to have a disease.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468223/\n\n**OLDPEAK:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, in this varable is expected to have the same a positive correctation,  if the variable increase, the condition or the likelihood to have a carrdiovascular desease also will increase, (have < 2 is normal, 1.5 - 4.2 is a risk and more than 2.55 is almost 100% that you will have some cardiovscular desease), in this dataset the correlation is correct.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/CLASSIFICATION-OF-OLD-PEAK_tbl2_44260568\n\n**THALACH:** Maximun hear rate archived, here the expectation is a negative correlation, higher heart rate archived is a normal condition, but if it is lower then likelihood increase to have a cardiovascular condition. https://www.ecronicon.com/eco19/pdf/ECCY-02-ECO-08.pdf  \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport

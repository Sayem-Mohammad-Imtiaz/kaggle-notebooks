He taught medical students before becoming a professor of astronomy at the University of Munich in 1826. \n    \nLike others before and since his time, Gruithuisen believed that the Earth's moon was habitable. He made multiple observations of the lunar surface that supported his beliefs, including his announcement of the discovery of a city in the rough terrain to the north of Schröter crater he named the Wallwerk. This region contains a series of somewhat linear ridges that have a fishbone-like pattern, and, with the small refracting telescope he was using, could be perceived as resembling buildings complete with streets. He published his observations in 1824, but they were greeted with much skepticism by other astronomers of the time. His claims were readily refuted using more powerful instruments.\n\nHe is also noted for the discovery of bright caps on the cusps of the crescent Venus, and for being the first to suggest that craters on the Moon were caused by meteorite impacts. He proposed that jungles on Venus grew more rapidly than in Brazil due to the proximity of the planet to the Sun, and that as a consequence the inhabitants celebrated fire festivals— the cause of the bright caps on Venus. \n    \n</div>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Interestingly, all 3 of them have Craters named after them."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What did I see?"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corpus = ' '.join(df['Description'].fillna('').values)\ncorpus = corpus.lower()\ncorpus = re.sub(r'[,.!*):(<]', '', corpus)\ncorpus = re.sub(r'\\s+',' ',corpus)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stopwords = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))\ntokens = nltk.word_tokenize(corpus)\ntokensWithoutStopwords = [token for token in tokens if not token in stopwords]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"biGrams = nltk.bigrams(tokensWithoutStopwords)\nfreqBiGrams = nltk.FreqDist(biGrams)\ntenFreqBiGrams = {' '.join(bigram[0]) : bigram[1] for bigram in freqBiGrams.most_common(10)}\ntenFreqBiGrams = pd.DataFrame(tenFreqBiGrams.items(), columns=['Bigram', 'Frequency'])\nfig = px.bar(tenFreqBiGrams, x = 'Bigram', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Ten Most Frequent Bigrams', \n             color = 'Frequency', color_continuous_scale='Gray', template = 'plotly_dark')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"triGrams = nltk.trigrams(tokensWithoutStopwords)\nfreqtriGrams = nltk.FreqDist(triGrams)\ntenFreqtriGrams = {' '.join(trigram[0]) : trigram[1] for trigram in freqtriGrams.most_common(10)}\ntenFreqtriGrams = pd.DataFrame(tenFreqtriGrams.items(), columns=['Trigram', 'Frequency'])\nfig = px.bar(tenFreqtriGrams, x = 'Trigram', y = 'Frequency', title = 'Ten Most Frequent Trigrams', \n             color = 'Frequency', color_continuous_scale='Gray',template = 'plotly_dark')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"response = requests.get('https://st.depositphotos.com/1724125/2605/v/950/depositphotos_26050193-stock-illustration-cartoon-moon.jpg')\nimg = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))\nmask = np.asarray(img)\n\nplt.subplots(figsize=(12,8))\nwordcloud = WordCloud(background_color='Black',\n                      mask = mask,\n                      contour_color='White', contour_width=5, \n                      stopwords=stopwords,\n                      width=1500, margin=10,\n                      height=1080\n                     ).generate(corpus)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Most of the anamolies that are observed have been about the presence of some sort of bright spot or a spot that has some different color visible like blue or violet.\n\nThere also have been a quite a few anamoly descriptions with mentions of Volcanic Activities, lets try to look at them aswell"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"volcanicAnamoly = df[(df['Description'].fillna('').str.contains('volcano|Volcano|volcanic|Volcanic'))]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"monthlyObservation = volcanicAnamoly['Month'].value_counts().reset_index()\nmonthlyObservation.columns = ['Month', 'Number of Observation']\nyearlyObservation = volcanicAnamoly.groupby('Year').size().cumsum().reset_index()\nyearlyObservation.columns = ['Year', 'Number of Observation']\n\nfig = make_subplots(rows = 1, cols = 2, \n                    subplot_titles=['Volcanic Observations over the Years','Volcanic Observations Each Month'],\n                   horizontal_spacing=0.1)\n\ntrace0 = go.Scatter(x = yearlyObservation['Year'], y = yearlyObservation['Number of Observation'], mode='lines',name = 'Yearly Observations')\nfig.add_trace(trace0, row = 1, col = 1)\n\ntrace1 = go.Bar(x = monthlyObservation['Number of Observation'], y = monthlyObservation['Month'], orientation='h', name = 'Monthly Observations')\nfig.add_trace(trace1, row = 1, col = 2)\n\nfig.update_layout(showlegend = False, template = 'seaborn')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There has been a total of 16 Volcanic Anamolies from 1787 to 1898. \n\nVolcanic Anamolies have been seen more frequently in the month on April.

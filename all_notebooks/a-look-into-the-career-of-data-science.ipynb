The boost in salary is most intense for very new programmers (<= 4 years), and very experienced programmers. The only negative gain in average salary appears in programmers well into their careers (9+ years). \n\nThe second chart is a point plot in [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). It shows point estimates and confidence intervals. For web, mobile, and desktop application developers salary linearly increases with the number of years of programming experience. Furthermore, there is a very tight confidence interval for the estimate of the mean salary for these job types.\n\nFor data scientists, the relationship between programming experience and salary is much less linear and the confidence interval at each experience level is much wider. This makes sense because programming experience is not the only prerequisite for the job of a Data Scientist. Data Science incorporates statistics, machine learning, visualization, and data analytics. Looking solely at programming experience does not give us a good estimate of the salary of a Data Scientist. This is great for new programmers who are interested in breaking into the field. The data shows that even with little programming experience you can gain the title of Data Scientist and there are still opportunities for high paying salaries.

The chance of any woman dying from breast cancer is around 1 in 37, or 2.7 percent.\n\nAnalysis the datset can provide insights in identifying and mitigating the risks. \n\nBased upon the followinig three factors we have to **classify** whether the patient survived/will survive 5 years and longer or not.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)\n2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)\n3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)\n\nTarget variable:\n1.

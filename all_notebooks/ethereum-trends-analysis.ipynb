News developments and speculation are responsible for fueling price swings in crypto and mainstream markets alike. But their effect is exaggerated in crypto markets as they have less liquidity than traditional financial markets — a result of crypto markets lacking a robust ecosystem of institutional investors and large trading firms. Heightened volatility and a lack of liquidity can create a dangerous combination because both feed off of each other. Other than bitcoin, most other cryptocurrencies also lack established and widely adopted derivatives markets. Under the sway of day traders and speculators, crypto prices sometimes exhibit healthy volatility of the type we see in mainstream markets.\n\n* Source : https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/volatility-index-crypto-market-price\n\nBut I still think that Ethereum still has a bright future especially after the recent developments of **Ethereum 2.0**","metadata":{}}]}

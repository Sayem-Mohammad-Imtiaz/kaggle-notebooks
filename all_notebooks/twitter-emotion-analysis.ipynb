The term emotion was introduced into academic discussion as a catch-all term to passions, sentiments and affections. The word emotion was coined in the early 1800s by Thomas Brown and it is around the 1830s that the modern concept of emotion first emerged for English Language. \"No one felt emotions before about 1830. Instead they felt other things - \"passions\", \"accidents of the soul\", \"moral sentiments\" - and explained them very differently from how we understand emotions today.\"\n\n\nFor more than 40 years, Paul Ekman has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise.[Source](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion)\n![Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions](https://www.martecgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-03-at-8.06.02-PM-768x346.png)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In 1980, Robert Plutchik diagrammed a wheel of eight emotions: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger and anticipation, inspired by his Ten Postulates.[45][46]\nPlutchik also theorized twenty-four \"Primary\", \"Secondary\", and \"Tertiary\" dyads (feelings composed of two emotions).

The first call would be to have the 'total' column be the target variable, since, in addition to reflecting the rent price, it also includes taxes/insurances that the tenant would have to pay; however the model would become unrealiable in my opinion, because of the inconsistencies present in the 'hoa' and the 'property tax' columns. For instance, the 'hoa' column represents the home owners association tax. As you can see within the plot above, a lot of the observations have home owners association tax equal to 0. It is not clear whether this indicates missing data or an exemption from the tax. This is also the case for the 'property tax' column. Additionally, as we saw previously, there are outliers in the hoa and the property tax columns, which cause the total column to also have outliers that we will have to deal with later. As such, it is best to use the rent amount column as the target variable, since it does not depend on inconsistent columns in the dataset or does not require background knowledge about the Brazilian taxation system. Additionally, another benefit of using the 'rent amount' column instead of the 'total' column is that the model will not be affected by the changes in the taxation system within Brazil, making our model more future-proof. \n\nLet's save our potential X and y dataframes and look at the categorical variables in the dataset.

Based on the mean value, as well as the median and the first and third quartile values, it seems plausible that such observations would contain no parking spaces, since they represent relatively small houses/apartments, which would not necessarily come with parking spaces. If we take a closer look at the maximum values, however, we can see that those values represent large houses/apartments, and it does not make sense for them to have no parking spaces due to their size. This is also the case for the testing dataset, which mostly consists of small houses/apartments, but also has large houses/apartments, which most-likely would have parking spaces. Based on this statistical summary, we can conclude that the parking spaces column most-likely contains missing values.\n\nWe can deal with this missing data in the following ways: remove it, impute it, or interpolate it. Whichever method we pick, it does not make sense to apply this to all of the observations with the value of zero in the parking spaces column. If we choose to remove all of those values, we would lose a large chunk of the training dataset, which is something we cannot afford. If we choose to impute all of the values, we would get rid of the missing data, but we would also invalidate a lot of observations with most-likely accurate values, possibly negatively affecting the accuracy of our model. Finally, if we choose to interpolate all of the observations, we could not only invalidate certain records, but we would also need to ensure there's a solid relationship between the 'parking spaces' variable and other variables in the dataset in order to accurately interpolate the missing values. As such, we need to apply one of the above methods to only certain observations in order to maintain a high degree of accuracy in our dataset.\n\nNow, we need to determine which observations we will apply the method to. For this, I am going to be using the numeric outlier technique. Although this is an outlier detection technique, I think it could be used here appropriately to identify observations that are the likeliest to contain missing values in the 'parking spaces' column. I am going to filter the training dataset to find only observations with no parking spaces. Then, I will look at the distribution of the 'rooms' column, since it is, intuitively, most closely connected to the 'parking spaces' variable. I will calculate the 'upper bound' for the 'rooms' column using the formula $q_3 + IQR*1.5$; this value corresponds to the top whisker in a boxplot. Any observation which contains a value above the upper bound in the 'rooms' column will be deemed an outlier, indicating that it most-likely contains missing data.\n\nBefore we put this method to use, let's take a look at the dat distribution of the 'area' column to confirm that this method makes sense.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-17T18:40:50.014541Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-17T18:40:50.014917Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-17T18:40:50.030495Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-17T18:40:50.014887Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-17T18:40:50.029497Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"no_parking_train = X_train[X_train[\"parking spaces\"] == 0]\nsns.boxplot(y=\"rooms\", data=no_parking_train).set(title=\"Boxplot of the 'area' column\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-27T09:57:39.843357Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-27T09:57:39.843664Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-27T09:57:39.952274Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-27T09:57:39.843638Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-27T09:57:39.951598Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above boxplot shows that this method makes sense, since a lot of observations with relatively high amount of rooms, which contain no parking spaces, however, were identified as outliers.

On average, our model is off by about 41% for this cluster. Our most accurate cluster is actually the medium-class housing cluster; our model, on average, is off by about 27%, which is a stark improvement compared to the 0th cluster. Finally, for the high-class housing cluster, our model is off by about 32%. Overall, our model is off by about 33%. I am somewhat happy with this result; however, we should always try to improve the model further and I have a couple of ideas and how we can possibly do that.\n\n### How can we improve our model? / Why wasn't our model more accurate?\n\nAlthough the two questions in the subheading sound similar, I am going to be answering them very differently. When answering the first question of the subheading, I will be focusing on my own method and my own analysis and how I can improve it. On the other hand, when answering the second question of the subheading, I will be focusing on the dataset itself, and the real estate market in general.\n\nLet's begin by answering the first question of our subheading: how can we improve our model? There are a couple of things we could incorporate into our method to improve the performance of our model.\n\nFirstly, as we saw previously, this model contains quite a few outliers, which stem from inconsistencies in the data. For instance, certain large houses/apartments had no parking, which is an unrealistic scenario. We tackled this by using a multivariate outlier detection technique, Mahalanobis Distance; however, we used a large cutoff-value, which we obtained from the Chi-Square distribution and a low significance value of 0.01. Perhaps, if we increased this significance value, to 0.05 for instance, we would identify more outliers, and then possibly remove more extremely unlikely observations, which currently decrease the performance of our model. There would be two downsides to this. Firstly, if we continued to use my method, we would have to go through more observations and check them by hand to see which value was 'strange'. This would take considerably more time, and there's no guarantee that this would substantially improve the performance of our model. Secondly, removing more values from the data isn't always the best solution to improving the model. Those observations could possibly be legitimate and pointing towards a particular trend in our data. This is not something we have to worry about too much when we have a really low significance value, because those identified outliers are incredibly far from the general data and are truly outliers. However, as we increase our significance value, this becomes a larger issue, because we begin removing observations which are not as far from the data and are less likely to be \"extreme\" observations. Additionally, in regards to outliers, we could also have used another method to identify outliers, in addition to Mahalanobis Distance, such as the Density-Based Spatial Clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), which is capable of identifying outliers; however, as we saw in [my previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/karimzakir02/outlier-detection-techniques), DBSCAN requires a lot of setup to work well.\n\nSecondly, when selecting features, we could have checked the effect of our potential features on the target variable by using more advanced statistical methods, such as ANOVA, or we could have used sklearn's inbuilt function for feature selection. The reason why I have not used these methods in this notebook is because I wanted to stick to more simple and traditional methods, like correlation. However, later, I will make sure to use these methods with this dataset or another one, because not only will I see if they improve the model, but also to learn them and understand better how to work with them. \n\nI am sure that my method in this notebook could be improved in infinitely more ways. So, if you have any more suggestions, I would really appreciate you commenting them below!\n\nNow, let's move on to the second question: why wasn't our model more accurate? As mentioned previously, now I will be talking more about the dataset itself. \n\nI think this dataset lacks some features that could have been useful in our analysis. Don't get me wrong, this dataset contains a good amount of features that are quite useful for our model, but there is definitely more data that could be scraped about the real estate in Brazil. For instance, does the building where the apartment is have a gym or a pool or any other extra benefits that could interest the tenants? Or how close is the nearest public transport point to the apartment? All of these potential features, which are hard to obtain, could have greatly improved our model and analysis in general.\n\nAdditionally, I had the opportunity to talk to a data scientist who closely works with real estate data, but mostly focuses on predicting prices of real estate offered for sale, not rent. He said that in his personal experience, he found that predicting the rent price is much harder than predicting the sale price, because a huge factor that comes into play for tenants is the \"coziness\" factor. This factor is extremely difficult to quantify, perhaps even impossible, and it's also incredibly subjective to each tenant, so this shows that there are certain features that we can't even create or use in our model, because they are so hard to obtain.\n\nAgain, the dataset could be improved in infinitely many ways, like almost anything in the world, so if you have any ideas/suggestions on what else could be added to the dataset, comment them down below. I would love to hear your insight!\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the model that we have developed is off by about 33% on average. This isn't too bad, but it's obviously not perfect either. Above, I have spoken about how this model can be improved and it's definitely something I will explore later in the future. If you have any ideas/suggestions, make sure to comment them below!\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this notebook! I hope you enjoyed it or even learnt from it!","metadata":{}}]}

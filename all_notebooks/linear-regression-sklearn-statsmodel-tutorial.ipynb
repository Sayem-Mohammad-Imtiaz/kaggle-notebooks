A linear relationship suggests that a change in response Y due to one unit change in X1 is constant, regardless of the value of X1. An additive relationship suggests that the effect of X1 on Y is independent of other variables. Polynomial terms (X, X², X³) can be included in model to capture the non-linear effect.\n* Error terms must be **normally distributed** with mean 0. If the errors are not normally distributed, non – linear transformation of the variables (response or predictors) can bring improvement in the model.\n* **Constant variance** (a.k.a. **homoscedasticity**)- This means that different values of the response variable have the same variance in their errors, regardless of the values of the predictor variables. Look at residual vs fitted values plot to check this assumption. If heteroskedasticity exists, the plot would exhibit a funnel shape pattern.\n* **No Autocorrelation**- There should be no correlation between the residual (error) terms. It is most likely to occur in time series model. If the error terms are correlated, the estimated standard errors tend to underestimate the true standard error. To check this use [Durbin-Watson test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic). The Durbin Watson test reports a test statistic, with a value from 0 to 4, where 2 is no autocorrelation,0 to <2 is positive autocorrelation and >2 to 4 is negative autocorrelation. A rule of thumb is that test statistic values in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 are relatively normal. Values outside of this range could be cause for concern. \n* **No Multicollinearity**- The independent variables should not be correlated. A variance inflation factor(VIF) detects multicollinearity in regression analysis. VIFs are calculated by taking a predictor, and regressing it against every other predictor in the model. VIF ranges from 1 to infinity. For example, a VIF of 1.9 tells you that the variance of a particular coefficient is 90% bigger than what you would expect if there was no multicollinearity — if there was no correlation with other predictors. A rule of thumb for interpreting the variance inflation factor:1 means not correlated, Between 1 and 5 means moderately correlated and >5 means highly correlated."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Converting categorical columns into numerical ones using dummy variables"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.children.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.children.replace([3,4,5],'More than 3',inplace=True)\ndata.children.replace(0,'Zero',inplace=True)\ndata.children.replace(1,'One',inplace=True)\ndata.children.replace(2,'Two',inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dummies = pd.get_dummies(data[['sex','smoker','region','children']],drop_first=True)\ndf_dummies = pd.concat([data,dummies],axis=1)\ndf_dummies.drop(['sex','smoker', 'region','charges','children'],axis=1,inplace=True)\ndf_dummies.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, our dataset is ready for regression.\n\n### Splitting data into train and test sets"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX=df_dummies\ny=data.charges\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.3,random_state=101)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Applying regression using SciKit Learn library"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing \nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nlm=LinearRegression()\nlm.fit(X_train,y_train)\npred_lm = lm.predict(X_test)\n\n# Our predictions\nplt.scatter(y_test,pred_lm)\n\n# Perfect predictions\nplt.plot(y_test,y_test,'r');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Evaluating the model"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error,mean_squared_error,explained_variance_score,r2_score\nprint(f\"Mean absolute error (MAE) is: {mean_absolute_error(y_test,pred_lm).round(3)}\\n\\\nMean squared error (MSE) is: {mean_squared_error(y_test,pred_lm).round(3)}\\n\\\nRoot Mean Squared error (RMSE) is: {np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,pred_lm)).round(3)}\\n\\\nExplained Variance Score is: {explained_variance_score(y_test,pred_lm).round(3)}\\n\\\nR-squared for transformed target variable is: {r2_score(y_test,pred_lm).round(3)}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"R-squared for actual target variable is: {r2_score(np.exp(y_test),np.exp(pred_lm)).round(3)}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> * RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals.

Seeing p-values in table we can conclude that all our variables are significant except 'children_Two' which is infact surprising.\n* Durbin-Watson test suggests that there is negligible autocorrelation as it is close to 2. Assumption of autocorrelation is also satisfied.\n* > Prob(Omnibus): One of the assumptions of OLS is that the errors are normally distributed. Omnibus test is performed in order to check this. Here, the null hypothesis is that the errors are normally distributed. Prob(Omnibus) is supposed to be close to the 1 in order for it to satisfy the OLS assumption.\n\n* In this case Prob(Omnibus) is 0., which implies that the OLS assumption is not satisfied. Due to this, the coefficients estimated out of it are not Best Linear Unbiased Estimators(BLUE).\n* It seems like a case where we would need to model this data using methods that can model non-linear relationships. Also variables need to be transformed to satisfy the normality assumption.\n\n# Polynomial Regression\n\nThe implementation of polynomial regression is a two-step process. First, we transform our data into a polynomial using the PolynomialFeatures function from sklearn and then use linear regression to fit the parameters. With the increasing degree of the polynomial, the complexity of the model also increases. Therefore, the value of n must be chosen precisely.

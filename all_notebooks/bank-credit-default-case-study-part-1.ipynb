Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Data is collected about a hypothetical finance bank which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. EDA is used to analyse the patterns present in the data.  The bank can use this data to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.  \n \nWhen the bank receives a loan application, the bank has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:  \n* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the bank\n* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the bank.\n \nThe data contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan. It contains two types of scenarios:  \n* The client with payment difficulties: he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,  \n* All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.  \n \n \nWhen a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/bank):  \n* Approved: The bank has approved loan Application  \n* Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.  \n* Refused: The bank had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).  \n* Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.  \n\nThis case study uses EDA techniques to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.\n\n\n### Business Objectives\n\nThis case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.  \n \nIn other words, we have tried to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The bank can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.   \n\n### Data Understanding   \n\n1. 'application_data.csv'  contains all the information of the client at the time of application. The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.\n2. 'previous_application.csv' contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.\n\n### Analysis Approach & Conclusions: \n\n* The purpose of this analysis is to give insights on credit default analysis and suggest customer parameters which have a clear indication of default. \n* The Analysis is done on current loan application data and previous loan application status data. \n* The current loan application is used to explore for insights on the factors that contribute to payment difficulties / loan default. \n* A merged data set of current loan application and previous application data is analysed to give insights on factors that contribute to Loan Approval, Rejection, Cancellations and unused offers. \n* The risk of default could broadly divided into \n* Risk attributed to Credit Good [Credit Good Risk]\n* Risk attributed to Consumer liabilities / behaviour [Consumer related Risk]\n* Loan application is approved based on below examination,\n* If applicant is new customer, then we look at Credibility and Demographics\n* If applicant is old customer, then we look at Credit history and Previous rejection causes.  \n\nThe following impressions have been drawn from the analysis \n\n#### Univariate Analysis \n**Gender** \n* There is a very high proportion of Female applicants (65.8%)\n* Only 7% of total female applicants have payment difficulties compared to 10% of total male applications. \n* It is possible that female applicants are safer borrowers than male.\n\n\n**Owning Realty** \n* Applicants who do not own Real-estate seem more likely to face payment difficulties than compared to the group of people owning the Real-estate.\n\n**Contact Address vs Work Address**\n* Applicants that live and work in same city are at less risk of payment difficulties.\n\n**Education** \n* Higher the education, lesser is the risk of payment difficulties.\n\n**Marital Status** \n* Applicants with FAMILY_STATUS as seperated or single or  have higher risk of payment difficulties compared to that of Widow and Married.\n* For the purpose of this analysis, civil marriage and married are treated equal. They might be merged into the one category.\n\n**Number of Days Employed** \n* The applicants with payment difficulties have lesser median days of employment compared to \"all other cases\". So, greater the DAYS_EMPLOYED, lesser is the risk of payment difficulties.\n\n#### Bivariate Analysis \n\n**Credit Amount and Price of Credit Goods** \n* Lower Credit Amount and Lower Price of Credit Goods have higher cases of Payment difficulties\n\n**Gender & Marital Status** \n* Customers most attractive to the bank by likelihood of default,  are 'Female Widows' > 'Married Females' = 'Separated Females' > 'Single Females' > 'Married Males' > 'Male Widowers' > 'Single Males' = 'Separated Males'      \n* The bank may focus their marketing campaigns on converting applications of Female Widows, Married Females, Separated Females. \n* May note that the dataset is skewed towards Females than Males.\n\n**Goods Price**\n* Median of \"Approved\" Category is 95,208.48. Any amount above this has high risk of getting refused or being cancelled.\n\n**Income and Annuity** \n* Income Range and Annuity have a mild correlation with Payment difficulties  \n\n**Education & Client Type**\n* Bank should look into the reasons why Repeat customers who are cancelling their offers. It could also focus on loans catered to academic degree holders who are first time customers.\n\n#### Top 10 correlations for 'No default'\n* AMT_GOODS_PRICE &  AMT_CREDIT \n* AMT_GOODS_PRICE &  AMT_ANNUITY\n* AMT_ANNUITY &  AMT_CREDIT \n* AGE_YEARS &  DAYS_EMPLOYED \n* AMT_ANNUITY &  AMT_INCOME_TOTAL\n* AMT_GOODS_PRICE &  AMT_INCOME_TOTAL\n* AMT_INCOME_TOTAL &  AMT_CREDIT\n* AGE_YEARS &  EXT_SOURCE_3\n* DAYS_LAST_PHONE_CHANGE &  EXT_SOURCE_2\n* DAYS_EMPLOYED &  AMT_INCOME_TOTAL\n\n#### Top 10 correlations for 'Default' are : \n* AMT_GOODS_PRICE & AMT_CREDIT\n* AMT_CREDIT & AMT_ANNUITY\n* AMT_ANNUITY & AMT_GOODS_PRICE\n* AGE_YEARS & DAYS_EMPLOYED\n* EXT_SOURCE_2 & DAYS_LAST_PHONE_CHANGE\n* EXT_SOURCE_3 & AGE_YEARS\n* AGE_YEARS & AMT_GOODS_PRICE\n* AGE_YEARS & AMT_CREDIT\n* AMT_GOODS_PRICE & EXT_SOURCE_2\n* AMT_CREDIT & EXT_SOURCE_2\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Look below for a detailed analysis","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install sidetable","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing required Libraries.\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport sidetable\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#setting max number of columns to be displayed to 100, to get a better view.\npd.set_option('display.max_columns',100)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows',100)\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nHTML('''<script>\ncode_show_err=false;

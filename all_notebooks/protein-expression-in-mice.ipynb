The boxplot for each protein is followed by a one-way ANOVA comparing the mean protein levels in the mice in the CS group. A p-value < 0.05 indicates that the difference between the means is statistically significant.\n\nFor example, a p-value of 0.0002 for DYRK1A_N indicates that if our null hypothesis, that there is no significant difference between the means, were true, there would be an 0.02% chance of observing our results. Thus, our results are statistically significant. We can see that DYRK1A_N levels in trisomic mice injected with memantine (rescued learning mice) are significantly higher than DYRK1A_N levels in trisomic mice injected with saline (failed learning mice). This suggests that higher levels of DYRK1A_N could be associated with learning in trisomic mice.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9a44b523ede9eb780107139e809173b34255bd37"},"cell_type":"code","source":"for p in proteins:\n    sns.boxplot(data = mouse_data, x = 'class', y = p)\n    plt.show()\n    \n    ccs = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 'c-CS-s'][p]\n    ccm = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 'c-CS-m'][p]\n    tcs = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 't-CS-s'][p]\n    tcm = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 't-CS-m'][p]\n    css = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 'c-SC-s'][p]\n    csm = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 'c-SC-m'][p]\n    tss = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 't-SC-s'][p]\n    tsm = mouse_data.loc[mouse_data['class'] == 't-SC-m'][p]\n    print(stats.f_oneway(ccs, ccm, tcs, tcm))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

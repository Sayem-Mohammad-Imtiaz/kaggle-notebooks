How should we define \"how well\"? What is this score being used for? That additional context would be useful, however let's begin to break out the problem. \n\n\n### TL:DR\n\n- Methodology used was to create a relative score based on percentage of people fully vaccinated\n- The benefits are\n1. We can better compare how countries are doing relative to others\n2. Our scores fit a normal distribution which makes other type of modeling and analysis easier\n3. The results are easy to communicate. \n\n\n### Approach \n- Pre-process data: Check data for NA, 0 or other issues.\n- Methodology: people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred as the topline metric. This is easily interpretable and can be analyized quickly. The final score provided is a relative score of the percentage of people fully vaccinated. I noticed that the data had a log-normal distribution, so I transformed it to fit a normal distribution. This way, the score could be easily implemented into a more sophisitcated model or analysis. \n  - Without having qualitaive analysis of how the different factors such as GDP/capita, population/density, pre-vaccine covid conditions, vaccine utilization, and how they correlate to the topline score, it made more sophisitcated scoring method difficult to produce. Given domain knowledge at this point in time, I stuck with the simpler approach. \n\n### Future work\n- What other factors impact the vaccine rollout that could be included in the score?\n    - Prior-covid cases/deaths: If a country has a higher proportion of the world cases, then vaccines should be prioritized to them\n    - GDP/captia: Developed countries have more resources and as a result will likely obtain a larger volumes of the vaccines realtive to poorer counties.\n    - Vaccine utilization: Based on how many vaccines available to the country, how effective is the country at distributing them? \n    - supply chain limitations\n- Create a time series of the scores and see how countries perform over time? Compare scores with a third dimension which is days from first vaccination. (ie lets say USA first vax was start of Decemnber and Japan was a month later, comparing those two at isn't necessairly equivalent) \n- Improving quality of data. There was a lot of missing data. This analysis took a lot of that into consideration.  \n\n   \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns\nimport scipy\nimport warnings\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom itertools import product\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport datetime\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/covid-world-vaccination-progress/country_vaccinations.csv')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Pre-Processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def quick_stats(df):\n    \"\"\"\n    displays a variety of statistics of a pandas dataframe\n    \n    parameters: \n        df: pandas dataframe\n        \n    returns:\n        null\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Dimenstions of dataframe: \" + str(df.shape))\n    print(\"Data types of dataframe: \" + str(df.dtypes))\n    print((df.describe()))\n    print( \"Nulls of dataframe: \" + str(df.isnull().sum()))\n    print((df == 0).sum())\n    \nquick_stats(data)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data is very incomplete.\n\nNotes: \n* There are 175 countries in the dataset.

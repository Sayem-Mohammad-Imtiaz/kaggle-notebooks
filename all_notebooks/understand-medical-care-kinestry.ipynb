What has been published concerning surge capacity and nursing homes? What has been published concerning efforts to inform the allocation of scarce resources? What do we know about personal protective equipment? What has been published concerning alternative methods to advise on disease management? What has been published concerning the processes of care? What do we know about the clinical characterization and management of the virus?\n\nWith a better understanding of these questions, it will not only help researchers and scientists in academia, but also provide frontline healthcare workers and decision-makers with a clear understanding of the medical environment during the pandemic.\n\nIn the first phase, we explored data integrity, accessibility, research institutions, and publication timeline, and provided an overview of the literature. Next, we constructed a Keywords-Article Matrix, and used BERT SQuAD based Question-Answer Model as tools to help the community better and quickly understand the topics.\n\nThis report includes:\n\n1. Data Integrity and Accessibility\n2. Research Institutions and Publication Timeline\n3. Literature Overview\n4. Keywords-Article Matrix\n6. Question-Answer Model\n\nThanks for the Team:\n\nBreeze Xue, Bo Peng, Elly Kyles, Longtao Wang, Siyao Hu, Greg Pawin\n\nNilesh Tiloda, Andrew McGregor, Andre Cunha, Akash Rawat, Jared Sacco\n\nOrganized by Eric Holdener, Andrew Zhang\n\nReported by Andrew Zhang, Jay Velasco\n\n\n\n\n\n# 1. Data Integrity and Accessibility\n\nTo gain an overview of published medical literature, we did a quick data exploration and analysis with the metadata. \nThe result shows:\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/1.1.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587687025&Signature=dopwF%2F67moOqGIthU00wrTkD2ZTgv%2BNd9iq%2B%2Bcso3ws3EbN%2BS3nAShq%2B35urbRVoVMSHGhAaShgbiAAaS1ScuVlFqzqdSulW4QEJCrzlgTMJZz3Nrd6VMLmU1a5j0mY9Q%2Ffvn6kPRtB%2BHokTBeRh1GKqb%2Bkk7rbaJ%2FXymxsiVegNbF%2Btp0gON1r2GEua4ZUFjCOxDsO4Mm%2BwR%2FEr%2BzJxCO5XluRx6RFQcdNVWGGhRVXrOOaKgTx29S%2FosoM0dJRZrnZEjor7V9PNV6rpOq%2BiHi4UzYWstQyiwTjVy2l3uEPLd2PClVIUF1VOzRknZDCxRMQdrwRgAk5jsYEJPlpsLA%3D%3D\" width=\"600\" />\n\n37.5% of the literature didn’t have the XML parsing, and 25.6% didn’t have the PDF parsed. That means not all articles had the full text. This led us to not only decide to analyze the full text to obtain specific information, but also to analyze the abstract to obtain additional information from other articles.\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/1.2.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587687123&Signature=JmDxazYgIUZ8EVA7lfRCzL1aUSsHjQ71esH590DrAvTpYGgvhcWMcjwvCRUtUqV1%2BhShV%2Bvx4pc48gVSpyJj%2BOYsf1FYjONLCV8OvmvjZWDCC%2BIxmfqX9%2FiyDzVr3Y9C6%2FI4DfZrfLXMhkJfiYA21hkKQr8%2BSfUu35BqRHQwUtuSz0Ox%2BviDiPX9q%2BxRyXmyTnbvAUMGydWrHA9gESUIY9tytY66wuKC0gZZkWO0i0NHduV8kfZzaguk86QMFpWnPzQM0euUPzuusea%2FUKoEXGu%2F4oH6uTpgAjgiCyuIuro0zX9pQ4Tpd57seRhHbR1Wzrp3n0xsqekoE4ba6eIuKg%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\n57.1% of the literature required licenses to access full-text sources, although they are accessible in this Kaggle challenge. For most doctors, nurses, other medical workers, and the general public, this kind of license to read literature may hinder the possibility of potentially finding important countermeasures from more medical insights. One of the largest publishers of scholarly journals, Elsevier, is offering some free health and medical research on the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19. \n\n\n# 2. Research Institutions and Publication Timeline\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/2.1.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587687144&Signature=aVGgkINXPhJikiiBt1W0ALbdiWifF%2FCPiT5DaKrnYLsgGCCK8yBzzTGhOrkr2oy%2BFsMiC5zTiKzzFLmrXVqo0WXhhvnTJB0PgaK6ykJBAB57zBQou1zPMhGnaIlGD782SdtG3oVS0kA4Cue6%2FCyPKc5GqHxUAaqgXNFqUBf07uskHaIU4K8Nw0xP3sPAMmsiZ2%2FkmX%2FcXFvuq7PzTjCIa3jyFMy8Ja9mMOQJvJN49VNa1tA1qu0jTvNc9yfww6%2F%2Fa1eKFU14DjFB2iE163iUb5l%2BAOty8K9RlAH7Xy%2FPWOiAeOev1ujRxbabxybpqGgQA1X4lZgUiS6G%2FMOD4L9RUg%3D%3D\" width=\"400\" />\n\nThe findings of these studies are mainly from universities ( Universitario), and hospitals. However, major research institutions need more co-operation to solve problems, especially between universities and hospitals– they need to work more closely together.\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/2.2.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587687167&Signature=Eg%2FK3V7tQWetZGCYk2VnOx1ig9iaBbGwGa%2Brp01Vy5peggqV8ogPB8ka8yB50hPdE0K8k71t92FYNPc8e7KlqzaL9uSFTu6nd7xYWPl%2BGdYnHxxFVDZ4a8pQIWT7%2BGmOGe7lS2bmcKk%2BblnTq7C%2BdNLjqYfcIk1xDIuk4pZ5puCwiYsOv0dFKeHDuo5uO6yeq4vGLIT%2Ftd0dQQxtF4EHw01LdszQ0bHLUvIzLVKCPlF0SGlnk5WzVFRQu%2FuApeC6cfg5LtqMCvWnW7HOdwG4lC5tP1Pc2Y6OFF%2Fb0tirGK6xONfi3Qvq4RH5PTumVvYs4BEloRja1mAdB7xllMhqKw%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\n\nThe number of related research literature has grown exponentially, and the number of papers in the first quarter of 2020 has far exceeded the number for the entire year of 2019. A similar situation happened in 2003 with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. This shows that during the SARS in 2003, global research institutions strengthened their ability to quickly respond to large-scale sudden public disease. This helps the rapid growth of research to better and quickly understand the COVID-19 epidemic today.\n\nMore results with code about the 1. Data Integrity and Accessibility and 2.

Literature Overview\n\nTo better understand the findings overall, we analyzed the title, abstract, and, if available,  the full text. \n\n### Title Analysis\n\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/3.1.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587686883&Signature=jN787Dd0HAD12ua2yBgPQ0Q8nOV6mrIbxX0aCaFqAZtNZUNPUxavjqXawzZE4gRFiu0vIrpj7FXLaqMEk7%2Bq9fzZVM5GLMyeYBvTBvwTGlgHwfkn%2FxdDd0hMz1%2FbhFCWj0U7AnSxT%2FpPn9xJweEc6zyxL1ITfsV2UI03JECZOxzuoP6cQgnx00wGUwDVt4z6EFcqrk6K%2BZMFdufTIpIlotacYB9uYpMRtHDRi8xZSfOTFz1xg6jjzwi0XHmZruGEzbaTAMlnY6lDNNHKs0pyvrwuU1BY4y1Z1zoO4QMNFcblAldCA14PUB1jStXNUCctTNZapfTbZyNAngLexuFZ6w%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\nThe title analysis shows that:\n\n* Most of the studies are about COVID (COVID, novel coronavirus, and nCOV) and  SARS. \n* The top studied region is China. We still need more studies regarding other countries and surrounding areas.\n* The top research targets of these studies revolved around the infection, patient, RNA, model, cell, protein, and case study. The studies with infection, patient, and case study in the title are possibly about medical care.\n\n### Abstract Analysis\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/3.2.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587686914&Signature=cP80zJysev7JmfCZ8BstWfeLVsSZXe34K8%2F3Tmmwhjtn1ClNtCx2HZAqUD33YqY3U9n8UPPdSDacU4fAVqbo1mdZg8TxJErGxyeS68FJdvU%2Ba0tjGwAIQBCS2qRA7l%2BctEDsjWCjpVj%2FU%2BoaSHOk1rgQsNtTK97ftrENWCbKmIgjGZw%2BvhiYAPYIIYEfP%2Bq5caLLfZYu%2BHLFOAEKlO7VbHIIjgiWwp3fjMGZZsz1T4SvtJBdqfoO507orVMBJN%2Bc0JZDW1szuEqRV5bW0rpAoYfF1MEuiw2hjY1uVHoyreEuE%2Fw5%2FM8JUxXmkQ2P8AhQlMGht7iKH85%2FeGVvQDtXOg%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\nThe abstract analysis shows that:\n\n* Most of the abstracts mentioned models and infection.\n* Virus, protein, data, patient, SARS are some additional key topics.\n\n### Full-Text Analysis\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/3.3.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587686928&Signature=PWDxJA0XoMCZ4v3pyPpsfbON0pd6nFcxp1Iok4zqRBhuElVCFSuUct6PWtSY1yhRPPypi3esj8SHBO7iKY%2F%2B3oTRKplVUD%2FHN9rdx4o2wTS7%2B9HoNGDgQS7q6%2BSJNkyj1rSX0aAT7bO7FDy2faug9uBCyyVCTzpZbkJYjVTmT7MYziGNlI6PUZqkX5coNEhEM4u3q6KaFsfZtMthRUPfwslT%2FSrjSRUxeHrocPye%2FCLdsLqfD0H0QKV08I0JaC56ARGgG2YS5Iwdt4omr%2BCGmWdQL4CIb1ocsjab46DTDGwasiwlWlh%2BKhgTw20I8DNvVHxgcaxChm7M3gz8E%2FIPNg%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\n\nThe analysis of the available full text shows that:\n\n* Most of the studies are about model, infection, virus.\n* Protein, SARS, Data, case study, and cell are also in most of the studies.\n\nMore results about the literature analysis with code please visit our data exploration and analysis [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kinestry/covid-19-literature-overview-kinestry-ipynb).\n\n# 4. Keywords-Article Matrix\n\nWe constructed a Keywords-Article Matrix to understand the articles’ properties for the 16 key findings based on the task requirement. We used the frequency of words that were repeated in the combined titles and abstracts to extract meaningful keywords.\n\n<img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/604783/1084859/4.1.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1587687001&Signature=gRdDFNZhUhQFhJe49XXs12920jHq4Ln7cR01W%2BRYVoWEwBNZlomahvAUQI%2BH2f6o3WywlWKunWIMTPQ97xsEG8r5FYlamcU5foBfBTUleEsv2Hp%2B8znjiOlRqzP6vzfFBig4R1gk5ubhHrmBJI6OyIuWMVDJHGu0a0KIwwLzy4Mrlj68lPTlB%2FlOxj1XBa7XZclhwIa9dJEeop3WAuvo6%2FsBsiAQ3qygxGDTUipQ0aShODrfy%2FiRvG8IWaBIohyCWyTT7g%2BMfOcgaIiied3p8UAkijyvSyLPGxXwowap7AWpShvaAnnzSWHf0pBp4%2BX6Ij5KOppsPZU6L69FkXtL2Q%3D%3D\" width=\"450\" />\n\nWe, then, come up with 16 sets of keywords based on the research review, brainstorm, and medical care professional consultation. For example, the keywords for the 1st key understanding, resources to support skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, are skilled nursing, long term care (or LTC), facility, health care, etc.\nWhat’s more, the study of  “Perceptions of hand hygiene practices in China” used “a qualitative survey design based on in-depth interviews with 25 key hospital and public health staff in eight hospitals selected by the Chinese Ministry of Health.” Our Keywords-Article Matrix revealed that this article was about “the best practices and critical challenges and innovative solutions and technologies in hospital flow and organization, workforce protection, workforce allocation, community-based support resources, payment, and supply chain management to enhance capacity, efficiency, and outcomes”. It can also be about “Efforts to define the natural history of the disease to inform clinical care, public health interventions, infection prevention control, transmission, and clinical trials.”\n\nTo explore the details about mapping the articles to the topics with code, please visit our Keywords-Article Matrix [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kinestry/covid-19-keywords-article-matrix-kinestry-ipynb).\n\n\n# 5. Question-Answer Model\n\nWe use BERT and Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) to build a Q&A model to help quickly find the possible answer from the articles for any related questions.\nFor instance, When you ask the model a question about “What is related to medical health care of covid-19 or coronavirus?” The Question-Answer model shows you a list of the related sentence from the articles with its ID. One of the returns for the question is “ID: 1019 Sentence: The impact of a 45-day delay in the epidemic due to early and accurate airport screening, allowing an effective vaccine to be developed and distributed, is also depicted.”\n\nTo explore the details about Q&A model , please visit our Question-Answer Model [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/kinestry/covid-19-question-answer-model-kinestry-ipynb).\n\nAny question pelase contact us. andrew at kinestry.io","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

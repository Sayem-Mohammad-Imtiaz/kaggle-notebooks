In gymnastics, All-Around is similar to decathlon by nature, as all routines are medal events, but all-around event requires gymnasts to perform all six routines to get a combined score. In international competitions, gymnasts perform in a qualification round at first, where they try to qualify for a medal round in all-around and other exercise events. The gymnasts who perform in all-around and place among the first 24 (and in Olympics, for instance, are among the top 2 for their national team) qualify to the all-around finals, and then the scores from other disciplines determine who qualifies for the finals for each individual event. So, in the finals, 24 gymnasts contend for medals in all-around and 8 in each exercise. There are no team competitions in the World Championships, so I was interested to see how the countries did as teams in medals and placings.\n\n### 1.2 Getting Average Medal Count for Countries who Won One Medal or More"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''\nGet Average Medal Count\n'''\nimport numpy as np\nfrom pandas import DataFrame, Series\n\ndef create_average_count():\n    countries = ['China', 'Croatia', 'Great Britain', 'Greece', 'Israel', 'Japan', 'Korea', 'Netherlands', 'Russian Fed.',\n                'Ukraine', 'United States']\n    gold = [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    silver = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0]\n    bronze = [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n    \n    medal_count = {'country_name': countries,\n                  'gold': Series(gold),\n                  'silver': Series(silver),\n                  'bronze': Series(bronze)}\n    medal_count_df = DataFrame(medal_count)\n    \n    average_medal_count = medal_count_df[['gold', 'silver', 'bronze']].apply(np.mean)\n    return average_medal_count\nprint(create_average_count())","outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 11 countries who won at least one medal.

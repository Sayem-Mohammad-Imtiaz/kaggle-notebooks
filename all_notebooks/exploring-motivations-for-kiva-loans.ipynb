This analysis does not particularly address the problem statement for the competition but rather will seek to understand the data though Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.\n\n** This is work in progress feel free to check back in later to see updates **. This version takes a deep dive into the loan information to see what we can learn about funding of these [loans](#loan_amounts) and then proceeds to explore borrower [gender](#gender). This is followed by analysis of the [lenders](#lender) both kiva.org users and local partners and then analysis of the [loan structure](#structure).\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis kernel is getting long :). I will collect some of the interesting observations up here. \n\n* The majority of loans are asking for below \\$10k with around \\$1,000 being the mean loan but the most frequently applied for loan is \\$225. So the data is heavily skewed.\n* Around 7% of loans are not funded.\n* The strongest predictor of full funding is the loan amount - bigger loans have lower chance of funding.\n* There are gender differences in loan funding - but these could be due to gender differences in loan amounts and types of loans\n* Males have higher chance of having their loan not being funded, as do teams that contain lower ratio of females to males.\n* The time to funding is also slower for males\n* On average the majority of loans are funded by between 1-30 lenders\n* The average amount of funding committed per lender is around \\$10 to \\$50. \n* Male teams on average have longer repayment intervals (16 months) than females (13 months). \n* For loans with terms longer than 5 years there appear to be a linear relationship between loan term and loan amount.\n* The overall majority of loans are repaid either montly or irregularly. However for male loans monthly and bullet payments are the preferred terms. \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import graphing and data frame libs\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style(\"ticks\")\n\n# statistics :)\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# we will do a little machine learning here - it is kaggle after all\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n#ignore warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n#pd.options.display.max_rows = 999\n\n%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format='retina'\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [14.0, 6.0]\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 14})\n","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the data\nkiva_loans = pd.read_csv(\"../input/kiva_loans.csv\")\n\n# dont trust the column metrics that they give you - there are null values hiding in here!\nkiva_loans.isnull().sum()","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d43c4b63-4ee8-4d84-90dd-19625816e42b","_uuid":"288534f7ca2d51fa12e627982d8f2fec911a59a6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is in the data?\n\nWe have:\n* [Loan Amounts](#loan_amounts): Funded and loan amount - these are dollar values of how much was loaned and how much was contributed by kiva.org\n* activity, sector, use, tags - these deal with what the loan will be used for\n* country and region - geographical information \n* [Loan structure](#structure): Term and repayment interval \n* [Gender](#gender): Demographic about the borrower\n* [Lender information](#lender): Lender count and information about when loan was posted and funded.

In addition people from El Salvador and Colombia are less likely to be funded while people from the Philipines are more likely to be funded. As for sectors education is more likely to be funded while retail is less likely to be funded. Finally, males are less likely to get funded than females - but they are also asking for larger loans.\n\nPlease note that these patterns are effected by the people that log into kiva.org and decide who to fund in combination with the people who decide to ask for funding on kiva.org.

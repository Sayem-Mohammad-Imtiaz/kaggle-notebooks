(6.)\nThe German government has announced that it will remove priority restrictions in vaccinations starting June 7.\nUntil now, only people listed by priority, ranked by age, medical condition and occupation, could receive most vaccines. However, with the removal of the restrictions, formally, anyone over the age of 16 will have an equal opportunity to be vaccinated.\n\nAccording to this article, Germany has just administered its 40 millionth dose of vaccine. And about 37 percent of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, with 11.2 percent receiving the full COVID-19 dose.\nIn addition, about 15 million people are scheduled to receive their first or second dose of vaccine by June 7, and now the authorities are already discussing when and how adolescents between the ages of 12 and 16 will be vaccinated.\n\n\nI discuss news related to the number of COVID-19 cases below.\nIn April, Germany passed a law giving the government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, the authority to fight the third wave of the coronavirus and imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. in areas with high infection rates.\nThe federal government can also impose a curfew in areas where the number of cases per 100,000 population exceeds 100 for three consecutive days, and even stricter restrictions can be imposed if the number of cases per 100,000 population exceeds 165.\n\nOn the other hand, in areas where the number of cases is below 100, each state has taken measures such as reopening outdoor sports and reopening the tourism industry. However, the resumption of indoor events will take some time, as Health Minister Jens Spahn has called on the states to give priority to outdoor activities to prevent new infections.\nThe German government will also soon put into effect a decree easing restrictions on people who are fully vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19.\n\n\nThe curfew has been in effect since April 24, and news articles reported that on Wednesday, May 5, the number of COVID-19 cases rose by 18,034 to 3,451,550, but the 24-hour figure was 4,000 fewer than a week earlier, and the seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people fell to 132 from 141 on Tuesday(May 4th), the lowest in three weeks since the third week of April.\nThis effect can be read from the graph I showed in section 4 of my report.\n\nFrom a personal point of view, I felt that by imposing strict restrictions such as curfews, limiting the number of people and requiring negative proof for shopping for daily necessities, etc., although it would be inconvenient at that time of the year, the period of time during which people would be restricted would be much shorter than if they had to resort to shortened hours and self-restraint on a request basis as in Japan.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Reference of this section\n\n・I used the above two as  main references.\n\nhttps://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-germany-drops-covid-vaccination-priority-from-june-7/a-57561658\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-looks-loosening-lockdown\nhttps://nordot.app/758481964258967552?c=302675738515047521","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Report No.7 -1 \nS1.Create a global animation of COVID vaccination cases per country (decide the column on your own).\nFreely select your own design (colorbar, range, etc)\nMake sure to describe what you’re visualizing and why you selected it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Create a global map for COVID-19 (Percentage of the population of the population that they are fully vaccinated).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/covid-world-vaccination-progress/country_vaccinations.csv',header=0)\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])\ndf = df.sort_index()\nprint(df.columns)\nfig = px.choropleth(df,locations='country',locationmode='country names',color='people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred',hover_name='country',animation_frame='date',color_continuous_scale='rainbow',range_color=(0.0,20.0))\nfig.update_layout(title_text=\"Percentage of the country's total populations that are fully vaccinated\",title_x=0.5)\nfig.show()\n\nplotly.offline.plot(fig,filename='vaccinations.html')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T01:23:22.93234Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T01:23:22.932714Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T01:23:26.006242Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T01:23:22.932675Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T01:23:26.005475Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# explanation of report No.7 -

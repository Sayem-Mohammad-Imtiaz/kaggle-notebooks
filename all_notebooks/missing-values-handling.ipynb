It can sometimes even lead to bad results. That is why it is very important to handle them appropriately. The best thing is to avoid having missing data at the time it is being created. But in real scenario, you are not the one who collects data. So you must work on what has been collected and handle it on your end.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Methods of handling them.***\n\nLet us now discuss how to handle the missing values.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are taking Titanic dataset.

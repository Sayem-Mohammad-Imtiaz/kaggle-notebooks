Be it shopping, watching movies or playing games we can do all these things online. With ability for consumer to share his/her reviews about the product or service he/she receives has made massive influence on shopping behaviours of consumers.\n\n- Products with very good rating high chances of ranking higher up in the Top product list. Having many positive reviews about product will give boost to the sell of product by attracting new consumers. Postive reviews gives customer a trust about quality of the product. But on same line, few negative reviews will repel the consumer from product. The major benifit of review or rating system can be seen on decline in malfunctioning.\n\n- On BoradGameGeek website, from where the data has been collected for this problem, ratings of games plays very crucial role in attracting new players towards those high rated game. The rating of games are on scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being 'Awful' and 10 being 'Outstanding'. For more information about the ratings, visit https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ratings&redirectedfrom=rating#\n\n\n- Data Description:\nThere are total 20 features columns for each game.\nFollowing are the features associated with each game:\n    - type: Type of game\n    - name: Name of game\n    - yearpublished: Year when game is published\n    - minplayers & maxplayers: Minimum and maximum number of players allowed to particiate in the game\n    - playingtime: Allowed playing time (maximum)\n    - minplayingtime & maxplayingtime: Minimum and maximum allowed playing time\n    - minage: Minimum age of player required to play\n    - users_rated: Total number of users given rating to the game\n    - average_rating: Avergae rating for game\n    - bayes_average_rating: Bayesian average rating for game\n    - total_owners: Total number of players who own this game\n    - total_traders: Total number of players who want to trade this game\n    - total_wanters: Total number of players who wants this game in trade\n    - total_wishers: Total number of players who added this game in their wishlist\n    - total_comments: Total number of comments\n    - total_weights: Total number of people given Game Play Weight to this game\n    - average_weight: Average weight of this game\n\nImportant Terms:\n- Rating: range 1-10. For more info: https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ratings&redirectedfrom=rating#\n- Game Play Weight: range 1-5. Community rating for how difficult a game is to understand.

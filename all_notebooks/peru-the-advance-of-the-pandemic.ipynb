Today, the country is the second in the region with the most cases (395 thousand) and deaths (18,612), behind only Brazil.\n\nThe prolonged confinement,  which started in mid-March, after the first reported case - was a blow to the economy of a country that, before the pandemic, had been growing above the Latin American average. GDP fell 17 per cent in the first five months of the year and more than 2.6 million jobs were lost, according to official data. Among the factors that explain the sharp drop is the high rate of informality, which reaches 70 per cent - and led to strong pressure to end the quarantine.\n\nThe high level of informality, which led many young people to work on the streets despite the confinement, a number of other factors, such as the precarious health system and disinformation, contributed to the worsening of the health crisis in the country.\n\nThe pandemic has reinforced structural health problems. There is a historic gap in the primary care system that cannot be resolved in four months. In addition, one in five households in the countryside lack basic services, such as water. In addition to the high level of informal work, especially among young people, the high displacement of workers helped to spread the pandemic, with the creation of so-called risk corridors. https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/suplica-de-mulher-presidente-peruano-vira-simbolo-do-avanco-da-pandemia-no-pais-24556588&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In addition, the adoption of experimental measures to deal with the disease, such as the contested restriction of movement of people by gender on alternate days, which caused more crowds - historically it is women who shop - and lasted less than 15 days.

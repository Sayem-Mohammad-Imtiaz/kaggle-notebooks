This could be due to many reasons such as data entry errors or data collection problems. Irrespective of the reasons, it is important to handle missing data because any statistical results based on a dataset with non-random missing values could be biased. Also, many ML algorithms do not support data with missing values.\n\nAfter starting a machine learning or a data science project you begin your EDA or exploratory data analysis hoping to find interesting patterns and insights about the data before you go on to extract features and build your model. But it is very common to find a lot of values missing in your data. These missing values arise due to many factors not in your direct control. Sometimes due to the ways the data was captured. In some cases the values are not available at all for observation. Nevertheless you will need to handle those missing values before you move further. Lets look at the ways to do that. To be honest there isn’t a single standard technique or a general solution to handle missing values but there are a few ways which you can use depending upon your use case to help you deal with missing values in your data. But before that lets see what are the types of missing data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Types of missing values**\nWe can classify the missing values in different types.

Missing Not at Random (MNAR)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**MCAR:** Missing Completely At Random. It is the highest level of randomness. This means that the missing values in any features are not dependent on any other features values. This is the desirable scenario in case of missing data.\n\n**MAR:** Missing At Random. This means that the missing values in any feature are dependent on the values of other features.\n\n**MNAR:** Missing Not At Random. Missing not at random data is a more serious issue and in this case, it might be wise to check the data gathering process further and try to understand why the information is missing. For instance, if most of the people in a survey did not answer a certain question, why did they do that?

This may lead to biased estimation of parameters.\n\n**2. Imputation**\n\nImputation is the process of substituting the missing data by some statistical methods. Imputation is useful in the sense that it preserves all cases by replacing missing data with an estimated value based on other available information.

The independent variables are used to fit a linear equation for the observed values of the dependent variable. This equation is then used to predict values for the missing data points.\n\nThe disadvantage of this method is that the identified independent variables would have a high correlation with the dependent variable by virtue of selection. This would result in fitting the missing values a little too well and reducing the uncertainty about that value. Also, this assumes that relationship is linear which might not be the case in reality.\n\n**K-Nearest Neighbour Imputation (KNN)**\n\nThis method uses k-nearest neighbour algorithms to estimate and replace missing data. The k-neighbours are chosen using some distance measure and their average is used as an imputation estimate. This could be used for estimating both qualitative attributes (the most frequent value among the k nearest neighbours) and quantitative attributes (the mean of the k nearest neighbours).\n\nOne should try different values of k with different distance metrics to find the best match. The distance metric could be chosen based on the properties of the data. For example, Euclidean is a good distance measure to use if the input variables are similar in type (e.g. all measured widths and heights). Manhattan distance is a good measure to use if the input variables are not similar in type (such as age, gender, height, etc.).\n\nThe advantage of using KNN is that it is simple to implement. But it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. It works well for a small number of variables but becomes computationally inefficient when the number of variables is large.\n\n**Multiple Imputation**\n\nMultiple imputations is an iterative method in which multiple values are estimated for the missing data points using the distribution of the observed data. The advantage of this method is that it reflects the uncertainty around the true value and returns unbiased estimates.\n\n**MI involves the following three basic steps**\n1. Imputation: The missing data are filled in with estimated values and a complete data set is created. This process of imputation is repeated m times and m datasets are created.\n\n2. Analysis: Each of the m complete data sets is then analysed using a statistical method of interest (e.g. linear regression).\n\n3. Pooling: The parameter estimates (e.g. coefficients and standard errors) obtained from each analysed data set are then averaged to get a single point estimate.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Pima Indians Diabetes dataset is used for our analysis.

Imputation:** The missing data are filled in with estimated values and a complete data set is created. This process of imputation is repeated m times and m datasets are created.\n\n**2. Analysis:** Each of the m complete data sets is then analysed using a statistical method of interest (e.g. linear regression).\n\n**3. Pooling:** The parameter estimates (e.g. coefficients and standard errors) obtained from each analysed data set are then averaged to get a single point estimate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install miceforest","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T15:08:14.252839Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T15:08:14.25327Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T15:08:23.871459Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T15:08:14.253233Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T15:08:23.870524Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import miceforest as mf\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load and format data\niris = pd.concat(load_iris(as_frame=True,return_X_y=True),axis=1)\niris.rename(columns = {'target':'species'}, inplace = True)\niris['species'] = iris['species'].astype('category')\niris","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T15:09:48.669613Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T15:09:48.670005Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T15:09:48.879056Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T15:09:48.669964Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T15:09:48.877866Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n\n# Introduce missing values\niris_amp = mf.ampute_data(iris,perc=0.25,random_state=1991)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T15:12:50.000958Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T15:12:50.001393Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T15:12:50.013834Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T15:12:50.001358Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T15:12:50.013085Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create kernels. \nkernel = mf.MultipleImputedKernel(\n  data=iris_amp,\n  save_all_iterations=True,\n  random_state=2000\n)\n# Run the MICE algorithm for 3 iterations on each of the datasets\nkernel.mice(5,verbose=True)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-01T15:12:52.268249Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-01T15:12:52.268782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-01T15:13:05.304089Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-01T15:12:52.26875Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-01T15:13:05.303171Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What we have done is created 5 separate datasets with different imputed values.

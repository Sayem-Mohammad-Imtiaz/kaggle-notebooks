The first thing we are going to do is define a bunch of functions to extract the data from the CSV files provided by the FBI via the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fbi-us/california-crime). These functions are also defined in the \"Cleaning Up The Crime Scene\" notebook; they're copied and pasted here without explanation so we can focus on analyzing the data. \n\nWe alrady covered the campus law enforcement data, specifically how to merge the two data files together to make a master data set, so in this notebook we'll write a function to import and merge that information with a single function call. We already explored some of its variables, and added some useful derived quantities, so we'll do the same for city data in this notebook, and see if we can utilize cross-connections between the two data sets to improve our understanding of campus crime statistics in a broader context."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"67441f1b-4543-eadb-acd1-5c7991a4aae0"},"outputs":[],"source":"# must for data analysis\n% matplotlib inline\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import *\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# useful for data wrangling\nimport io, os, re, subprocess\n\n# for sanity\nfrom pprint import pprint"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5037c931-f5df-f74c-f9f8-d0881aaa23f5"},"source":"<a name=\"campus_data\"></a>\n## Importing Campus Data\n\nWe'll start with a function to import data about all California campuses and stitch them together, as we did in the last notebook, \"California Crime Compendium - Campuses\". This consisted of two function calls to convert two files to two DataFrames, then a regular expression to fix a few errant digits, and finally, a call to the `pandas.merge()` function to stitch the two DataFrames together.\n\nThis required some delicate handling of the input files, in the `ca_law_enforcement_by_campus()` and `ca_offenses_by_campus()` functions, to strip white space in the proper spots and avoid mistakes like thinking \"Campus\" is a different column than \"Campus \". \n\nSpeaking of which - prior notebooks copied-and-pasted this functionality into a huge cell.

The more narrow distribution (smaller variance) means that property crime occurs at around the same rate everywehre, and a higher mean (distribution shifted to the right) means property crime occurs across society at some baseline rate (again, in the log scale above, -2 means 10^-2 or 1/100, which means 1 incident per 100 people)."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"755cfcc4-674d-cc20-7d6f-7c1bbcd56bde"},"outputs":[],"source":"vcqq = stats.probplot(df_city['Per Capita Violent Crime'][df_city['Violent crime']>0].map( lambda x : np.log10(x) ), dist=\"norm\")\n\n# len: 327\nvcqqx = vcqq[0][0]\nvcqqy = vcqq[0][1]\n\ncut1 = 3\ncut2 = 214\nplot(vcqqx[:cut1],vcqqy[:cut1],'o', color=sns.xkcd_rgb[\"dusty green\"])\nplot(vcqqx[cut1:cut2],vcqqy[cut1:cut2],'o', color=sns.xkcd_rgb[\"denim blue\"])\nplot(vcqqx[cut2:],vcqqy[cut2:],'o', color=sns.xkcd_rgb[\"watermelon\"])\ntitle('Per Capita Violent Crime: Quantile-Quantile Color Coded for Outliers')\nshow()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ff349b53-130b-725b-aff4-8ea477ca1ce5"},"outputs":[],"source":"print(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Unusually high per capita incidence of property crime:\")\nprint(df_city[['City','Population','Per Capita Property Crime']].sort_values('Per Capita Property Crime',ascending=False)[:cut1])\nprint(\"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Unusually low per capita incidence of property crime:\")\nprint(df_city[['City','Population','Per Capita Property Crime']].sort_values('Per Capita Property Crime',ascending=True)[:df_city.shape[0]-cut2])"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ca84e8b9-1239-639a-f25b-584e06860408"},"source":"<a name=\"campuses_and_cities\"></a>\n## Campuses and Cities\n\nLet's return to the campus data that we analyzed in the \"California Crimes Compendium - Campuses\" notebook.

We'll address that shortly.)\n\n<a name=\"pop_vs_crime\"></a>\n### Left Plot: Population vs Aggregate Crime Rate\n\nLet's look at the first plot, on the left: the city and campus per capita crime rate. This shows an interesting pattern: if we ignore UCSF as an outlier, there are two opposite trends in the two categories of data. The blue data, the per capita crime rate in the surrounding city, starts from being very high, and gradually decreases with campus size. The green data, the per capita crime rate on campus, starts from being very low, and gradually increases with campus size. \n\nThis curious result seems to indicate that the effect of increasing city size on crime rate is the opposite between the college population and city-dwellers. It's important to note that the cities here are not cities in California generally - they are specifically cities with colleges and universities in California. The effect of increasing size on crime rates in a college/university city tends to be downward (per capita frequency of crime decreases as cities get bigger), while the opposite happens as colleges and universities: as their population increases, the frequency of crime increases.\n\n<a name=\"pop_vs_crimeratio\"></a>\n### Middle/Right Plots: Population Ratio vs. Crime Rate Ratio\n\nThe second and third plot are illustrating the same thing with different axes. These plots show a remarkable pattern in the nature of crime at colleges and universities, but should be read carefully to interpret it properly. This figure shows the population ratio (city to campus) on the x-axis, and the city to campus ratio of crime on the y-axis. Thus, a value of 10 means city is 10 times larger than the campus. The schools with low values here are UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz and UC Santa Barbara, which are large schools relative to their surrounding environs. UC Berkeley also has a small value, but is obviously in a bit different situation than UC Davis."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0e34f157-689f-29cc-1415-e109d91315f4"},"outputs":[],"source":"fields = ['University/College','Campus','City to Campus Population Ratio']\ncampus_matches[fields].sort_values(fields[2],ascending=True)[:4]"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"56cb9bbb-258e-9399-7b0e-1490e72ddeb7"},"source":"The quantity on the y-axis is a log plot of the ratio of per capita incidence of crime in the city to per capita incidence of crime on campus.

The first notable fact is that all of the points except UCSF lie above $10^0$ - or 1 - meaning, with the exception of UCSF, campuses are safer than the cities that surround them, across the board.\n\nHere's UCSF, the only campus with a per capita incidence of crime *higher* than the surrounding city:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"24021191-7cd0-d0f1-13f2-a5199adf9a9d"},"outputs":[],"source":"fields = ['University/College','Campus','City to Campus Per Capita Crime Ratio']\ncampus_matches[fields].sort_values(fields[2],ascending=True)[:4]"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"688d073b-b2d8-779c-97fc-28689ec0e6d7"},"source":"This graph has the shape of an inverted V - which has definite significance. The V starts around 1: when a campus makes up 25% or more of a city's population, the violent crime rate on campus is within an order of magnitude (1-10 times smaller) than the crime rate in the surrounding city.\n\nThe steady increase in this graph means that as the surrounding city gets larger relative to the campus, the crime rates in the city also get larger relative to the crime rates on campus. This trend indicates campuses are (relatively) safer than the surrounding city.\n\nThis trend stops abruptly when the size of the surrounding city becomes larger than 10 - and immediately reverses. As the cities surrounding universities and colleges increase in size relative to the campus, the crime rates on campus rise to match the level of the surrounding city.\n\nThe two big outliers on the right are also surprising - particularly the bottom right point. These are campuses in large cities (Los Angeles), where the crime rates are extremely high.

We've picked an interesting relationship between the campus-to-city ratio of populations and the campus-to-city ratio of crime rates. We were able to fit a linear model to these two variables by splitting the data into two bins and fitting them separately with models. We then used a quantile plot to analyze the outliers. \n\nWe're now looking at the residuals (we plotted their quantiles above) and seeing how they might change, functionally, with some variables. For example, if we found that the residuals had a very clear, very obvious quadratic relationship with some particular variable $x_J$, then we would go back and revise the model to include a parameter for a quadratic term. \n\nSeaborn's `PairGrid` functionality, which creates pairwise plots of variables, is great for this purpose. We can map a scatterplot to the PairGrid to get a scatterplot of the residuals as a function of various other factors we expect might affect the residual. The plot below picks one law enforcement statistic, two per capita crime stats, and a population stat. \n\n(Note that earlier we showed that law enforcement stats didn't correlate very strongly with rates of crime, and that crime incidence is most closely tied to the surrounding city."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"59592b33-61a8-1d10-ef88-68447f6a7891"},"outputs":[],"source":"fields = ['Resid',\n          'Per Capita Law Enforcement Personnel campus',\n          'Student enrollment',\n          'Population']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,6))\ng = sns.PairGrid(z[fields])\n#g.map(scatter)\ng.map_diag(hist)\ng.map_offdiag(scatter);\nplt.show()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9cf4d855-b407-5d63-1559-ac2b03acbfeb"},"outputs":[],"source":"qqdat = z.sort_values('Aggregate Crime Per Officer campus')['Resid']\n\n# Get the hi side linear model residual quantiles\nhiqq = stats.probplot( hiresid, dist='norm' )\nhiqqx = hiqq[0][0]\nhiqqy = hiqq[0][1]\nplt.show()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2981bb02-c6f9-f860-4b15-2d7fd3afea57"},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

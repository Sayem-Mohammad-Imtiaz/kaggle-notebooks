Introduction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is employee attrition?\n---\n\nFrom \"Tech Funnel\": _\"Employee attrition is a gradual but deliberate reduction in the number of employees in a company or business organization. Employees will at some point in time look to change their job places for a number of reasons. It might be for professional or personal reasons but it does happen.\"_\n\nThis definition give us a key point: \"Employees change their jobe places for a number a reasons\". So, now the question is: **What are the reasons why an employee quits?**\n\nPersonally I think that this question is very important for any company, this is because the hiring process is expensive in most of the cases.\n\nSusan Heathfield explains in her article [Top 10 Reasons Why Employees Quit Their Jobs](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-reasons-why-employees-quit-their-job-1918985) the next reasons:\n\n1. Relationship With the Boss\n2. Bored and Unchallenged by the Work Itself\n3. Relationships With Coworkers\n4. Opportunities to Use Their Skills and Abilities\n5. Contribution of Their Work to the Organization’s Business Goals\n6. Autonomy and Independence on the Job\n7. Meaningfulness of the Employee's Job\n8. Knowledge About Your Organization’s Financial Stability\n9. Overall Corporate Culture\n10. Management’s Recognition of Employee Job Performance\n\nIn this notebook I'll concentrate on prove the relationship between relation with the boss, bored and unchallenged, relationships with coworkers, salary, overtime and employee attrition.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

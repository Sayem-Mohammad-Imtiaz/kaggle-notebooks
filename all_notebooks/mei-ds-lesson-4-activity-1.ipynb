The activity uses the data from the MEI large data set 1 which gives information about different countries. \n\nThe most common library for plotting in Python is *matplotlib*. This needs to be imported using\n`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` which adds it with the short name `plt`. Pandas can call some of the plots from *matplotlib* using simplified commands.

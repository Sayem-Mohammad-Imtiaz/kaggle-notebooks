Seoul, South Korea. Courtesy of Kim Joon-hee*\n\nIt is common knowledge that air pollution can cause several problems in the environment and in our health. The photo above was taken on December 11th, 2019 and shows how it can severaly impacted Seoul landscapes. In this occasion, a smog of ultrafine dust, coming all the way from China, lasted two days and made the local government issue emergency emission reduction measures. According to [The Korea Times](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/02/281_280126.html), the Air Quality Forecasting Center, filliated with the Ministry of Environment, reported that on December 11th at 10 p.m the concentration of PM2.5 particles was about 118 micrograms per cubic meter in Seoul. \n\nGiven that context, my intention in this study was to understand and visualize how air pollution is distributed geographically in the 25 districts that compose the country's capital. To do so,I analyzed a dataset containing hourly collected records of six pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10, PM2.5) during a period of three years. In Seoul, each district has its own station measuring this set of pollutants, so I could analyze both pollution as whole and segregated by region.\n\nThis kernel provides maps to show the concentrations of gases and particles in Seoul as well as time series analysis to figure out cycles, sazonality and tendency. In the appendix I also analyze if there is a pattern in the occurence of errors in the stations. **This is my first kernel in Kaggle doing EDA and I'm still learning how to this properly. Feel free to comment below suggestions or errors, it really helps me a lot. And if like this notebook, please give it an upvote. Thank you!**\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Importing data and libs](#importing-data)\n- [Data preparation](#data-prep)\n- [Exploratory analysis](#eda)\n    * [Where are stations located?](#eda-map-station-loc)\n    * [Pollution levels](#eda-pol-level)\n    * [Does pollutants have correlation?](#eda-pol-corr)\n    * [How pollutant concentrations varies with location?](#eda-pol-local)\n    * [What are the most and least polluted regions of Seoul?](#eda-pol-most-least)\n    * [What really happened on that December 11th?](#eda-11-dec)\n    * [Does the concentration of pollutants have sazonality and tendency?

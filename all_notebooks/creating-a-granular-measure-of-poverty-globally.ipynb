It also looks like the relationship to the field partner-level rural percentage is broadly the same, suggesting to me that the distinction between Rural MPI and Urban MPI from above is largely captured by the region-level disaggregation (i.e. when distinguishing between rural and urban Kiva borrowers, we are usually talking about distinct regions with corresponding differences in MPI score).\"\n\nThe objective of our project is to create a more localised poverty index that also has a more accurate distinction between rural and urban borrowers in order to enhance the current MPI.\n\n### The dataset\nThe Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk and Reduction 2015 (GAR15) is the external dataset being used to create this more granular index.\n\nThe data is supplied in a geospatial Esri Shapefile format. For all countries where there is a Kiva loan present, GAR15 data was downloaded from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) website (https://data.humdata.org/). The Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) is an open platform for sharing data, launched in July 2014. The goal of HDX is to make humanitarian data easy to find and use for analysis.\n\nThe GAR15 global exposure database is based on a top-down approach where statistical information including socio-economic, building type, and capital stock at a national level are transposed onto the grids of 5x5 km using geographic distribution of population data and gross domestic product (GDP) as proxies.\n\nThe image below shows the countries where GAR15 data has been downloaded for this analysis. The green points represent the GAR15 data whilst the red points represent the Kiva loan locations:\n![data_extent_small.PNG](https://78.media.tumblr.com/f955b0c142aedeaf94233b6536e2dcc4/tumblr_p8sm8u0hFO1xtbpnno9_1280.png)\n\nSince the data contains socio-economic information (i.e. size of lower/middle/upper classes) and a breakdown of the types of capital stock that would be related to poverty (i.e. schools and hospitals) we have repurposed GAR15 to be used as a poverty index.\n\nThe image below shows a zoomed version of the GAR15 data focussing on the city of Bamako in Mali; an area which has had multiple Kiva loans granted. Through utilitising the GAR15 data it will be possible to assign a new poverty index to the loans based on geospatial nearest neighbour analysis:  \n![bamako_small.PNG](https://78.media.tumblr.com/6108115a84668d8705387e3999f0a6f7/tumblr_p8sm8u0hFO1xtbpnno6_400.png)\n\nThe dataset contains impressive specificity at a global scale, with 4,573,567 rows of data. Each 5x5km grid containts  54 attributes on the population and capital stock within each one across the health and education sectors as well as employment and residential.\n\n#### Measures within the GAR15 data:\n**Capital Stock** - the value of the asset in million US$ - The economic value of each building class in one cell is assessed based on the disaggregation of the (national) Produced Capital at grid level. This downscaling was done by using the sub-national values of economic activity as a proxy. The result is the global distribution of the economic value of the urban and rural produced capital by construction class\n**Population** - the number of residents of the buildings in the grid\n\n\n#### Sources:\nA detailed description of the sources that were used for the GAR15 dataset is available here: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/1c9cf1eb-c20a-4a06-8309-9416464af746/resource/bf90aaad-b438-4570-8550-1cd6314599d5/download/please-read-metadata-exposure2015.pdf\n\n\n#### Assumptions:\n- Areas with a high value of educational and healthcare assets are more prosperous\n- Areas where a higher proportion of the population is middle class is more prosperous\n- Public/private sector split is not crucial and the raminifactions of it are unclear, therefore these numbers are combined for the purposes of calculating the index\n\n#### Limitations of the data to be taken into account:\n- Value of the assets as a proxy only go so far, in comparison to more typical (but higher level metrics) infant mortality, immunisations per 1000 population\n- Just because an area has high health assets doesn't mean all people have access to it\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1422116-d516-4ebf-a197-962bdb2ac10c","_uuid":"9d575ce625502027c64649beb92348f6b791cdf6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Methodology"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b68a2d0d-4a6c-4aa1-9e1e-42b037904f02","_uuid":"3bafce1d632019903de2a8ec93fb61a83a65a48e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.

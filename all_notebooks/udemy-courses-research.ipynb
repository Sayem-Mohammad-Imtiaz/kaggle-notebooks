the data we have that the first course was published in the middle of 2011 and the last one was published in the middle of the 2017 year, so the statistic for these two years isn't clear to analyze it. We only can see that between 2011 and 2012 the amount of courses increase slowly and evenly, there is no big difference between subjects. The general annual graph also confirms that fact. This may be due to the fact that in 2011 online learning platforms weren't as popular.\n\nWe can see that in 2012 Business Finance courses start to gain popularity and grows steadily for the next 3 years, and then in 2015 growth slows down. And also it's seen that the amount of Web Development courses stats to increase at the same time with Business Finance, but not so fast at first. Just in 2014 Web Development increases dramatically and going up very fast. Apparently, that growth is going on in 2017 too, but we can't affirm it for sure due to lack of data.\n\nAnd more creative directions Music and Design also started to increase faster since 2012-2013.

Either way, we'll have to change our approximation to this dataset if we want to extract some model.\n\nIn the correlation analysis we noticed that the grades (G1, G2 and G3) have strong correlations between them.

This could be caused because we need to collect data from a bigger sample size, or maybe because the grades are influenced by another different variables that we're not considering on this database. Anyway, we've also good news: it seems to be some kind of similar pattern between the grades that the students get on the three periods, showing a continuation on the school results. It will be needed some extra research in this field in order to get more clear results."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

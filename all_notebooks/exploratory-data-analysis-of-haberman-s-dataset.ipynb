The lines extending parallel from the boxes are known as the 'whiskers', which are used to indicate variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Outliers are sometimes plotted as individual dots that are in-line with whiskers. Outlier is the data point that differs significantly from the other observations. It lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution.\n\nThe Box and Whisker Plot was first introduced by mathematician ** John Tukey ** in 1969. Box Plots can be drawn either vertically or horizontally.

for trinaing is more skewed towards office building type\n* Approximately 55% accuracy result may not be good enough to predict thermal comfort with high confidence\n\n**Recommendations:**\n* Using more diverse and evenly distributed dataset for training (e.g. include more climate types, more different building types)\n* Include radiant temperature as one of the feature variables since this is one of the more recognised factor affecting thermal comfort\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# End"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python

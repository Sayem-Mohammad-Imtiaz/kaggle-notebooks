So I was wondering, will this be the case for a team? If a team makes one shot, will they take a further and more difficult shot for the next one? Individuals tend to be less rational after making one shot, but how about a team as a group? Will the decision making from a group compensate for the irrationality of individuals?\n\nI wrote a blog about my analysis here: https://haowang204.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/shooting-rationality-of-nba-teams/\n\nThe python code is uploaded to: https://github.com/wh0801/NBA-shooting-rationality-2016-17-Regular-Season\n\nLet me know your thoughts!"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c01cfc45-782a-1cd2-af3b-dec11fe44de2"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

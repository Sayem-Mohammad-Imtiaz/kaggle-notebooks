We're going to answer this simple question using an analaysis technique called \"Partial Pooling\". We're trying to come up with the probability $p$ that each player will make his next shot, based on the data we already have. You can think of this as an inherent skill for each player- the closer to 1 the value of $p$ is, the better the player is at free throws.\n\nOne way of answering this question is to assume that every basketball player has exatly the same chance of scoring his next free throw- i.e. each have the same inherent skill. In this case, we'd work out this skill value by taking the total number of shots made divided by the number of shots in total.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"01fbbf21-ff23-48bc-bbc0-474c673e13ea","_uuid":"e5b6f6540a3a609336d686c08e624d20132998eb","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code here to take the average\n%matplotlib inline\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns #pretty plotting\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/free_throws.csv')\nglobal_average=float(df['shot_made'].sum())/df['shot_made'].count() #Could also say df['shot_made'].mean() here\n\n\nprint(\"Average for all players: p={:.3f}\".format(global_average))\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"44524112-1231-4c60-8d5b-90b017eceea8","_uuid":"188bc7eb505f9a702edc8d7ed93c04dd7ff2857b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What we're really doing here (perhaps without realising it) is assuming that this data is a series of [Bernoulli trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial), and taken together they will follow a [Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution). In a binomial distribution, the expected number of successes (free throws) is given by $np$, where $n$ is the number of attempts and $p$ is the probablity of success (what we want to measure). Our data give us the number of trails and the number of sucesses, so by doing the average above (succeses/attempts) we get the probability of sucess.\n\nThis is known as \"Complete Pooling\"- we're lumping all players together as one to get a single number for the whole population.

It's better than the complete pooling case, but it still runs into some issues. When looking at a dataset like this, it's inevitable that not all players take the same number of free throws. So how can we compare a player who's taken 1,000 with someone who's only taken 50? Is a player who makes 45/50 free throws better than one who makes 18/20? Or 900/1000? \n\nAlso, we get strange values for some players- there are a few who have made 10/10 shots, so do we asisgn them a probability of making their next shot of 1? Likewise, a couple have missed 4 out of 4. Are they no hopers, destined never to make a free throw in their whole career? We could arbitrarily exclude players with less than, say, 100 shots, but we don't want to throw away data if we don't have to. \n\nFinally, we know that it's not correct to assume that the skill levels of the players are _completely_ independent. They're still taking the same shots with (mostly) similar techniques, and all NBA players can't have got to where they are without a pretty high baseline of free throw shooting skilll.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"33962869-6c23-4121-95bf-209ca07d79e1","_uuid":"3528e538a69f9b33c483530623dc8fc0b719fe2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Partial Pooling\n\nThis is where \"Partial Pooling\" comes in, with the best of both approach. We assume that each player has his own skill value $p_{i}$, but that each of these $p_{i}$ values are drawn from one global probability distribution common to all players. Now, a truly great free thrower's impressive record will shine through and shift his measured skill level higher, whilst we still get reasonable answers for those players who haven't taken many free throws yet- they'll be biased towards the global average until they've taken enough shots to shift them to their rightful place. Another way of saying this is that we're going to set an informative \"prior\" on the skills of individual players, based on the data from all the other players put together.  \n\nSo what do we choose as this prior probability distribution? Let the data decide! We'll get this distribution straight from the data too, which is why this is known as a \"hierarchical\" method.

We know that the repeated bernoulli trials of free throws follow a binomial distribution, and we know that each player's $p_i$ must be between 0 and 1. We'll approximate the global skill level distribution as a [beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). This makes sense for a couple of reasons. Firstly, a beta distribution is only defined on the interval [0, 1], which is reasonable for probabilities. Furthermore, it's the \"conjugate prior probability distribution\" for a binomial distribution, which essentially means that the _output_ (\"posterior\") probability distribution for each player's $p_i$ is also guaranteed to be a beta distribution, which makes sense intuitively and guarantees that we'll have $0<p_i<1$."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"242523fe-66a1-46e4-a210-32796c1e22fd","_uuid":"3a34c36d4c8f27021d434da1477d298655295b28"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll have to have some \"hyperparameters\" to parameterise our global skill distribution, which we'll call $\\phi$ and $\\kappa$. $\\phi$ parameterises where the peak of our global skill distribution is.

Females perform higher in reading and writing subjects.\n2. Males perform higher in math.\n3. Parental education level has a negligble difference in student's test performance.\n4. Students who ate the standard lunch tested higher than those who ate a free/reduced meal.\n5. Students who completed a test preparation course scored higher than those who did not.\n\n**Discussion**\nAll categorical data was statistically tested against the exam scores using a 1-Way ANOVA test. This test allows us to accurately confirm whether a category of data is correlated to the numerical outcome. Using a 95% confidence internal we acheived p-values < 0.05 for each catergory of data. This allows us to reject our null hypothesis and summize that the catergorical data in this dataset is correlated to the reading, writing, and math scores."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

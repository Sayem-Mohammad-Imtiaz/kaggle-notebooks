Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n\nThe data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this notebook, we try to combine historical usage patterns with season data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"17df90e34cb110a55af731757d8fc349d33a8068"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import stats, integrate\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n%matplotlib inline\npd.options.display.float_format = '{:.2f}'.format\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (8, 6)\nplt.rcParams['font.size'] = 14","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bikes=pd.read_csv(\"../input/bikeshare.csv\", index_col='datetime', parse_dates=True)\nbikes.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7cd05dc75500a2eb52c9d785060ec9aeb6f6ade6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# \"count\" is a function, so to avoid  confusion we change the column name to total\nbikes.rename(columns={'count':'total'}, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0a860b5a35ecbae2f36c83111e951ea418b6aad8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"bikes_data=bikes.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0eada1190ff59587294c6975087ba5a6ad568289"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(bikes_data.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"205fe59e6c89ea059fab4b54166d18618b03753e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"bikes_data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1fed7259cf933e65335fa683366b3d10f4ae5251"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThe number of bikes rented on a average is 191.5 bikes.But due to large variation in min and max values of bikes rental lead to a high standard deviation.

The model predicts the difference between a customer’s behaviour when there is a treatment and when there is no treatment. In the digital advertising industry, for example, this treatment could be exposure to different ads and uplift modelling could then be used to direct marketing efforts towards users for whom this intervention is most efficient. This is important because some customers will naturally respond to treatments in different ways:\n\n* <b>Persuadables</b> will always respond POSITIVE to the marketing communication. They are going to purchase ONLY if treated.\n* <b>Do-Not-Disturbs </b> (a.k.a. Sleeping-dogs) have a strong negative response to a marketing communication. They are going to purchase if NOT treated and will NOT purchase IF treated.\n* <b>Lost Causes </b> will NOT purchase the product NO MATTER they are contacted or not. The marketing budget in this case is also wasted because it has no effect.\n* <b>Sure Things </b> will purchase ANYWAY no matter they are contacted or not. There is no motivation to spend the budget because it also has no effect.\n\nThe goal of uplift modelling, therefore, is to identify the “persuadables”, not waste efforts on “sure things” and “lost causes”, and avoid bothering “sleeping dogs”, or those who would react negatively to the treatment, if they exist. Uplift modelling has found application in many domains including marketing, medical treatments and political campaigns."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\n\nNow that we know the goal of uplift modeling, how do we get there? A typical starting point for building an uplift model is a dataset from a randomized, controlled experiment: we need a representative sample of all different kinds of customers in both a treatment group, as well as a control group that didn’t receive the treatment. If the proportion of customers making a purchase is significantly higher in the treatment group than the control group, we know that the promotion is “working” since it encourages a purchase on average across all customers. This is called the average treatment effect (ATE). Quantifying the ATE is the typical outcome of an A/B test.\n\nI use an anonymised dataset published by The Criteo AI Lab which is available [here][1]. The dataset is constructed from an incrementality tests, a particular randomized trial procedure where an advertiser prevents a random part of the population from being targeted by advertising. It consists of 13M rows, each one representing a user with 12 features, a treatment indicator and 2 labels (visits and conversions). \n\nA more detailed description of the features is shown below:\n* f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11: feature values (dense, float)\n* treatment: treatment group (1 = treated, 0 = control)\n* conversion: whether a conversion occured for this user (binary, label)\n* visit: whether a visit occured for this user (binary, label)\n* exposure: treatment effect, whether the user has been effectively exposed (binary)\n\nIn real data, the features may correspond to such things as customer purchase history, demographics, and other quantities a data scientist may engineer with the hypothesis that they would be useful in modeling uplift.\n\nLet’s load the data and briefly explore it.\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/uplift-modeling/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Total number of samples: {}'.format(len(df)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['treatment'].value_counts(normalize = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset is largely imbalanced - around 85% of users were treated while only 15% were in the control group.\n\n# Basic Eda"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"style.use('ggplot')\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\nplt.subplots(figsize = (20,15))\n## Plotting heatmap. \n\n# Generate a mask for the upper triangle (taken from seaborn example gallery)\nmask = np.zeros_like(df.corr(), dtype=np.bool)\nmask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True\n\n\nsns.heatmap(df.corr(), cmap=sns.diverging_palette(20, 220, n=200), annot=True, mask=mask, center = 0, )\nplt.title(\"Heatmap of all the Features\", fontsize = 30)\nplt.yticks(rotation=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Percentage of users that visit: {}%'.format(100*round(df['visit'].mean(),4)))\nprint('Percentage of users that convert: {}%'.format(100*round(df['conversion'].mean(),4)))\nprint('Percentage of visitors that convert: {}%'.format(100*round(df[df[\"visit\"]==1][\"conversion\"].mean(),4)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Again, the 2 binary labels (visits and conversions) are both highly imbalanced but how do these metrics compare between the control and the treatment groups?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vis_results_df = df.groupby('treatment').agg({'visit':['mean', 'sum', 'count']})\nvis_results_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"con_results_df = df.groupby('treatment').agg({'conversion':['mean', 'sum', 'count']})\ncon_results_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Difference in clickthrough rate between control and treatment: {np.round(df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"visit\"].mean()[1] - df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"visit\"].mean()[0], 4)}')\nprint(f'Difference in conversion between control and treatment: {np.round(df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"conversion\"].mean()[1] - df.groupby(\"treatment\")[\"conversion\"].mean()[0], 4)}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"More users visit in the treatment (4.9%) than the control group (3.8%), indicating the treatment is effective at encouraging users to visit: the ATE is positive and is about 1%.

One way to measure uplift is using a Qini curve (Radcliffe, 2007), which shows the cumulative number of the incremental positive outcomes or uplift as a function of the number of customers treated.

Such models allow data scientists to segment populations into groups that are more likely to respond to treatment, and those that are less so. In this example, the effect of properly exposing users to the treatment  is shown to significantly increase the incremental outcomes compared to the normal treatment group. As can be seen the evaluation of uplift models is not as straightforward as that of supervised classification or regression models because it requires separate consideration, and comparison, of treatment and control groups. However, open source Python packages ([CausalML](http://https://causalml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Pylift](http://https://pylift.readthedocs.io/), [Scikit-Uplift](http://https://scikit-uplift.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), have been created to facilitate uplift model development and evaluation. \n\n\n<b> Some resources that helped me and I recommend taking a look at if you're interested in finding out more: </b>\n\nGubela, Robin & Bequé, Artem & Gebert, Fabian & Lessmann, Stefan.

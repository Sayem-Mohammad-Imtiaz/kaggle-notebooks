I read an article from the Journal of Economic Perspectives and they stated that males have \"superior\" spatial skills that gave them the advantage. Back in history, males are heavily involved in hunting, an activity that required greater spatial orientation than females' tasks and that could explain why there are more males in STEM field. \n- So why do females tend to be better in reading and writing? There are few reasons. Research evidence has shown that girls use both brain hemispheres when presented with reading and writing tasks, whereas boys are more likely to using a single hemisphere of the brain. Another reason could be the gender differences in behavioral problems, such as physical aggression and disobeying rules, as well as attention disorders, which have been associated with general reading and writing impairments."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"distribution(df, 'race/ethnicity')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Well, this does not really tell us much since we do not know what each group represents"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"distribution(df, 'parental level of education')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- It seems to us that students with parents that held a Masters tend to do well for all 3 sections.

This is much expected from values created from generators.\n- We observe that females are better performed in writing and reading while males are better in math. Part of the reason could be due to evolutionary traits that provide males with \"superior\" spatial traits. In females, studies have shown that they use both brain hemispheres when presented with reading and writing tasks, whereas boys are more likely to using a single hemisphere of the brain.\n- Students that have highly educated parents tend to perform better but due to the small sample size, it's hard to confirm that hypothesis. \n- Students that have standard lunches performed better as they have higher energy levels that can support their immense study loads.\n- Students who took test preparation courses did significantly better since they are better trained with resources that can help them in an actual setting.

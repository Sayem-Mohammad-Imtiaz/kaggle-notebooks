Kaggle has provided only red wine quality dataset. The dataset I have used is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Both Red Wine and White Wine Data is used in this notebook.\n\n**Data Set Information:**\nThe two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine. Quality is based on sensory scores (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"LN3gvlAEqnc1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading Libraries\nAll Python capabilities are not loaded to our working environment by default (even they are already installed in your system).

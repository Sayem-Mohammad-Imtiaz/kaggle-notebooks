First of all what we get from this visualization is how many outliers we have, the min and max points, the median and IQR.\n\nAs we already saw in our previous calculations of least and highest runtime, this is the appropriate visualization in the comparison of other movies runtime.

Each values in the y-axis is been multiplied to `'1e10'` (as shown above the plot). Since the profits of movies are high, having 9+ digits, cannot fit the axis. So for example at the year 2010, the y-aixs value is around `1.35`, which means that the profit at that year made by al movies released in that year is `1.35x1e10 =  13500000000` which is `13.5 billion dollars`.\n\nThe year `2015`, shows us the highest peak, having the highest profit than in any year, of more than `18 billion dollars`. This graph doesn't exactly prove us that every year pass by, the profits of movies will increase but when we see in terms of decades it does show significant uprise in profits. At the year `2000`, profits were around `8 biilion dollars`, but in just 15 years it increased by 10+ biilion dollars. Last 15 years had a significant rise in profits compared to any other decades as we can see in the graph.\n\nNot every year had same amount of movies released, the year `2015` had the most movie releases than in any other year. The more old the movies, the more less releases at that year (atleast this is what the dataset shows us).\n\nThis dataset also doesn't show all the movies that has been released in each year. If it would the graph might would show some different trend.\n\nAlso to note, In the dataset, there were also movies that had negative profits which drags down the the profits of other movies in those years. So we are not just calculating the movies which made profits, but also which went in loss! The highest profit making movie `Avatar` in 2009 alone drags the profit up by `2.5 billion dollars` out of `14 billion dollars`(calculations below).\n\nFor convenience, i have shown which year had the most profit.

In comparison, even `Adventure` and `Thriller` really play the role. These five genres have more number of movies than rest of the genres as shown by visualization. Probability of earning more than \\$50M for these genres are higher, but still other genres do count too again it depends on lots of other influential factors that come in play. `Western, war, history, music, documentary` and the most least `foreign` genres have less probability to make this much in profit as in comparison to other genre.\n\nThis also doesn't prove that if you have a movie with an `Action, comedy and drama` genre in it will have a guarantee to make more than $50M but it would have a significant interest and attraction to the population.\n\nLet's find one more key characteristic of these movies.\n\n>> ### H\n#### Which month released highest number of movies in all of the years?

Where there are more movie released there is more profit and vice versa but just not for one month i.e `December`. December is the month where most movie release but when compared to profits it ranks second. This means that december month has high release rate but less profit margin. The month of June where we have around `165 movie` releases, which is second highest, is the highest in terms of making profits.\n\nAlso one more thing is we earlier finded which movie had made the most profit in our dataset, We came up with the answer of movie, `'Avatar'`, and the release month for this movie is in december, also the highest in loss movie had also released in december but that isn't being counted here. Knowing this that you have the highest release rate and highest profit making movie in same month of `December` but falls short in front of `June` month in terms of making profits makes me think that the month of June had movies with significant high profits where in december it didn't had that much high, making it short in terms of profit even though having the advantage of highest release rate.\n\nThis visualization doesn't prove us that if we release a movie in those months we will earn more $50M. It just makes us think that the chances are higher, again it depends on other influential factors, such as directors, story, cast etc.\n\n-----"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"84378e9d-cb42-454f-aa0b-222f1749bd1b","_uuid":"64b83ebadf0554b1a85459d0d4c21f750a794c47"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n\nAs i have answered the questions that i thought would be interesting to dig into, i want to wrap up all my findings in this way ....\n\n\n**Q. If i wanted to show one of the best and most profitable movie, who would i hire as director and cast, which genre would i choose and also at what month would i release the movie in? **\n\n**Ans.** I would..\n\n**Choose any director from this** - Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Ron Howard, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott.\n\n**Choose any cast from this** - Actors - Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Sylvester Stallone, Denzel Washington.\n\nActress - Julia Roberts, Anne Hathaway, Angelina Jolie, Scarlett Johansson.\n                            \n**Choose these genre** - Action, Adventure, Thriller, Comedy, Drama.\n\n**Choose these release months** - May, June, July, November, December.\n\nBy doing all this, my probability of making a profitable movie would be higher and obviously i will take care of other influential factors too. ;) And also the runtime of the movie will be around 110 min (mean runtime of movies with \\$50M+). \n\n**Limitations** -  I want to make it clear, it's not 100 percent guaranteed solution that this formula is gonna work, meaning we are going to earn more than \\$50M! But it shows us that we have high probability of making high profits if we had similar characteristics as such. All these directors, actors, genres and released dates have a common trend of attraction. If we release a movie with these characteristics, it gives people high expectations from this movie. Thus attracting more people towards the movie but it ultimately comes down to story mainly and also other important influential factors. People having higher expectations gives us less probability of meeting their expectations. Even if the movie was worth, people's high expectations would lead in biased results ultimately effecting the profits. We also see this in real life specially in sequels of movies. This was just one example of an influantial factor that would lead to different results, there are many that have to be taken care of!\n\nAnd that's my conclusion! \n\n------"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

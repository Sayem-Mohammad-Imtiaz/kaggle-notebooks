The cornerstones of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets and compete, and security of the person and privately owned property. Reference [Fraser Institude Economic Freedom Report] (https://www.fraserinstitute.org/economic-freedom)\n\nThis is considered my first work, and I want to define my country so that it will be in the field of my knowledge only. I am familiar with what happened at that time and I can link the numbers and the events well We will discuss in this kernel simple analyzes about\n* the Egyptian economic reality and the political \n* economic situation of the government,\n* The policy of the state and the level of transparency of the law\n* January 25 Revolution and its causes and consequences\n\nAll that is mentioned in this kernel is based on analyzes of the previous data studied and linked to the real events, do not bias any government or any particular system, does not accuse any government or any system of corruption, but the figures will show that or you will notice\nThis kernel was just a training on the above study can add some points that I can work on it or leave a comment to me about it, I will work later on the data of the world and continents one by one but at the moment I want a comment to encourage you to do more.

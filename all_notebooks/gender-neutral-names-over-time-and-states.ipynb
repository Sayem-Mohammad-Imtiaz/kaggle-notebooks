It's got maps. Every kernel is better with a map, right? A summary of notebook's content is given below.\n\n* Gender neutral names of the first half of the XXth century were mostly used in the southeastern states such as Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia. The names that were popular there for both boys and girls included Willie, Jessie, Johnnie, Billie, Tommie and so on - you see the pattern. This group of names has been declining in popularity since the 1930s and is rather rare now. The most popular name left of this kind is Charlie.\n\n* Today's distribution of names' gender ambiguity over the states is much more uniform. \n\n* Phonetically the gender neutral names seem to either end with some form of -ie or -y (Kelly, Tracy, Jamie) or with a consonant (Taylor, Jordan, Alexis). \n\n* The most recent popular and gender neutral name is Riley.\n\nTechniques-wise I tried some pandas MultiIndex slicing with `pd.IndexSlice` here. It's a handy way of selecting a subset of names in a subset of states, for example. \n\nI've also tried making some interactive charts using Plotly. Setting up a choropleth (colored areas) map turned out to be pretty easy with Plotly. There's also a line chart and a scatterplot where hover tooltips make it possible to include much more data than would be readable on a static chart. I've found Plotly easier to work with than Bokeh. Examples are easy to google and the charts are nice. No, they didn't pay me to write this =).\n\n*plotly graphics don't show up when editing kernels but they do show in rendered version.*\n\n*markdown cells from uploaded notebooks lose their text*"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3054b1e3-2ed7-c155-2bc6-d57afc77d77a"},"outputs":[],"source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\nfrom plotly import tools\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"eda1578c-312f-0f1c-5322-e11bebad90d7"},"source":"## Load data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d12bd62e-1826-ab99-56c0-437f1c8dd042"},"outputs":[],"source":"dn = pd.read_csv('../input/NationalNames.csv',index_col='Id')\nds = pd.read_csv('../input/StateNames.csv',index_col='Id')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b55619e1-19dc-6fee-255c-cbba64c681c0"},"source":"As a measure of ambiguity I'm using the probability of guessing a baby's gender wrong knowing their name.

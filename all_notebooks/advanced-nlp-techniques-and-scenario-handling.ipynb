There are so many concepts we are implementing in this book,\nand we might get overwhelmed by the content of it. To make it simpler\nand smoother, let’s see what is the flow that we need to follow for an NLP\nsolution.\nFor example, let’s consider customer sentiment analysis and\nprediction for a product or brand or service.\n\n* Define the Problem: Understand the customer sentiment across the products.\n* Understand the depth and breadth of the problem: Understand the customer/user sentiments across the product; why we are doing this? What is the business impact? Etc.\n* Data requirement brainstorming: Have a brainstorming activity to list out all possible data points.\n* Data collection: Based on the data andthe problem, we might have to incorporate different data collection methods. In this case, we can use web scraping and Twitter APIs.\n* Text Preprocessing: We know that data won’t always be clean. We need to spend a significant amount of time to process it and extract insight out of it using different methods \n* Text to feature: As we discussed, texts are characters and machines will have a tough time understanding them. We have to convert them to features that machines and algorithms can understand using encoding methodolgies (discussed in a separate notebook)\n* Machine learning/Deep learning: Machine learning/Deep learning is a part of an artificial intelligence umbrella that will make systems automatically learn patterns in the data without being programmed. Most of the NLP solutions are based on this, and since we converted text to features, we can leverage machine learning or deep learning algorithms to achieve the goals like text classification, natural language generation, etc.\n* Insights and deployment: There is absolutely no use for building NLP solutions without proper insights being communicated to the business. Always take time to connect the dots between model/analysis output and the business, thereby creating the maximum impact.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>Noun Phrase extraction","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import nltk\nfrom textblob import TextBlob","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T15:27:26.549766Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T15:27:26.550226Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T15:27:28.222345Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T15:27:26.550178Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T15:27:28.221238Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"blob = TextBlob(\"Jacob is learning NLP\")\nfor noun in blob.noun_phrases:\n    print(noun)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-13T15:27:28.224099Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-13T15:27:28.224432Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-13T15:27:33.184618Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-13T15:27:28.224383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-13T15:27:33.183835Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2>Text similarity</h2>\n\nThis can be achieved in multiple ways:\n\n* Cosine similarity: Calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.\n* Jaccard similarity: The score is calculated using the intersection or union of words.\n\n    `Jaccard Index = (the number in both sets) / (the number in either set) * 100`.\n\n* Levenshtein distance: Minimal number of insertions, deletions, and replacements required for transforming string “a” into string “b.”\n* Hamming distance: Number of positions with the same symbol in both strings.

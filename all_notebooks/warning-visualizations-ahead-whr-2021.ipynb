The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.

The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness._\n\n![Happy kids!](http://www.awarenessdays.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kidshomepage1.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Content\n\n_The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity â€“ contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the worldâ€™s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

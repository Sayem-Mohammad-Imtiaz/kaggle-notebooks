Introduction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"During my studies, I tried to find a good example (or notebook) about RReliefF (Relief for Regression). Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything that suited my needs, as there were many examples for Classification, and almost none for Regression. So, I decided to collaborate with the Kaggle community and create an example of how to use RReliefF. To achieve this goal, I used the sklearn_relief library (https://gitlab.com/moongoal/sklearn-relief)\n\nRelief is an algorithm developed by Kira and Rendell in 1992 that takes a filter-method approach to feature selection that is notably sensitive to feature interactions. It was originally designed for application to binary classification problems with discrete or numerical features. Relief calculates a feature score for each feature which can then be applied to rank and select top scoring features for feature selection. \n\nRobnik-Šikonja and Kononenko propose further updates to ReliefF, making it appropriate for regression (RReliefF, the focus of this notebook)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

The testing performance on a hold-out set is typically used to score the feature set. Alternatively in a modeling algorithm like a random forest (that I used in this example) , estimated feature importance scores can be applied to select a feature subset. In any wrapper method, a new model must be trained to test any subsequent feature subset, therefore wrapper methods are typically iterative and computationally intensive, but **can identify the best performing features set for that specific modeling algorithm**. Each iteration of the wrapper, the feature subset is generated based on the selected search strategy, e.g. forward or backward selection or a heuristic feature subset selection."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nof_list=np.arange(1,20)            \nhigh_score=0\nnof=0           \nscore_list =[]\nfor n in range(len(nof_list)):\n    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size = 0.3, random_state = 0)\n    fs = sr.RReliefF(n_features = nof_list[n])\n    relief = Pipeline([('fs', fs), ('m', RandomForestRegressor())])\n    relief.fit(X_train,y_train)\n    score = relief.score(X_test,y_test)\n    score_list.append(score)\n    print(f'NOF: {nof_list[n]}, Score: {score}')\n    if(score > high_score):\n        high_score = score\n        nof = nof_list[n]\n\nprint (print(f'High Score: NOF: {nof}, Score: {high_score}'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this case, I wrapped the RReliefF algorithm in an Random Forest Regressor pipeline.

Conclusions"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Accordinly to the original paper, RReliefF can **discover strong dependencies between attributes**, while in domains without such dependencies it **performs the same as the mean squared error**.

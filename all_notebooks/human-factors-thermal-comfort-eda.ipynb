There have even been popular news outlets who have covered stories on sexism in office temperatures from the New York Times, the New Yorker, and Time Magazine. The question related to this task is to piece together evidence from the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Database II to show how factors such as sex, age, metabolism, and other factors influence comfort.\n> \n> **Expected Submission**\n> Users who want to tackle this task should use the Kaggle Kernels to piece together data and evidence gathered from the data set that provide a foundation for their analysis. The analysis should include a lot of documentation to provide clarity of the techniques and approach used.\n> \n> **Relevant Literature**\n> A great overview of recent work to analyze these differences can be found in this recent publication: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324809583_Individual_Difference_in_Thermal_Comfort_A_Literature_Review","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Data - As Provided\nAlongside the data, the following information has been provided:\n\n> Dataset Source: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078/D1F671\n> \n> **Abstract**\n> Recognizing the value of open-source research databases in advancing the art and science of\n> HVAC, in 2014 the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II project was launched under\n> the leadership of University of California at Berkeley’s Center for the Built Environment and\n> The University of Sydney’s Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) Laboratory.\n> The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last\n> two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The final database is comprised\n> of field studies conducted between 1995 and 2015 from around the world, with contributors\n> releasing their raw data to the project for wider dissemination to the thermal comfort research\n> community. After the quality-assurance process, there was a total of 81 846 rows of data of\n> paired subjective comfort votes and objective instrumental measurements of thermal comfort\n> parameters.

(2018), ASHRAE Global … doi:10.6078/D1F671\n> data formatting within the database.\n> Data must have been published either in a peer-reviewed journal or conference paper.\n> All datasets from individual studies were subject to a stringent quality assurance process\n> before being assimilated into the database. The research team conducted a final\n> validation by first comparing each raw dataset with its related publication provided by the data\n> contributor to prevent transmission errors. Systematic quality control of each study was\n> performed to ensure that records within the database were reasonable. Firstly, distributions of\n> each variable were visualized to identify aberrant values. Then, cross-plots between two\n> variables (e.g. thermal sensation and thermal comfort) were used to check for incorrectly coded\n> data. Finally, a few rows from each study were randomly selected to verify consistency between\n> the original dataset and the standardized database.

I note for example, that not only are temperatures observed at 0.1m, but also at 0.6 and 1.1m above the floor. Similarly, both metric and imperial units will be used.\n\nAs such, I will default to using only metric (degrees C) measurements. Similarly, I will default to using the SET (standard effective temperature) unless a true temperature observation is required. In such a case, observations taken at 1.1m above the floor will be used, since this approximates the centre of a human's core.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initial Strategy\n\nSince our objective is to investigate the parameters that influence thermal comfort perception, the following variables will be dependent variables:\n\n* Thermal Sensation\n* Thermal Acceptability\n* Thermal Preference\n* Thermal Comfort\n\nWe should seek to examine how these variables are affected by the temperature (as defined by SET), and in turn, how this relationship is affected by other (independent) variables.\n\nAlthugh I will perform a matrix analisis later in this investigation \"common-sense\" independent variables to investigate include:\n\n* Climate Classification (do people from different climates require different temperatures)\n* Outdoor temperature (does outside temperature affect comfort)\n* Building type (do people need different temperatures for different activities)\n* Country\n* Age\n* Sex\n* Weight (do people of different weights require different conditions, and does weight vary by region)\n* Height (do people of different heights require different conditions, and does weight vary by region)\n* Metabolic Activity (How activity affects people - do some compensate better than others)\n* Humidity (do some people tolerate humidity better?)\n\nIn order to examine these variables, we will need to control for confounding variables. For example, when examining Sex or Age, we will need to ensure that we maintain a constant proportion of say, Building Type & subjects from each city/country.\n\nThe most obvious strategy to do this, would be to use a combination of normalisation, binning and weighting techniques to create a standard representative \"breadbasket\".\n\nOn a personal note, I am a data analyst with a physics background - my domain knowlege is somewhat limited. Although I will endevour to do background reading, I will focus my efforts on what information can be derrived from statistics, rather than modeling of bioloigical systems etc. ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # Linear Algebra\nimport pandas as pd # Data Processing , CSV file I/O\n\n#List the files in the input dataset\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Lets read the CSV blindly - just to see how it handles it.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/ashrae-global-thermal-comfort-database-ii/ashrae_db2.01.csv')\n\ndf.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Now lets try it, just selecting columns of interest, and specifying the dtype.\n\ncols = [\n'Publication (Citation)','Year','Season','Koppen climate classification','Climate','City','Country',\n'Building type','Age','Sex','Thermal sensation','Thermal sensation acceptability','Thermal preference',\n'Thermal comfort','SET','Met','Air temperature (C)',\n'Ta_h (C)','Relative humidity (%)','Humidity preference','Humidity sensation','Subject«s height (cm)',\n'Subject«s weight (kg)','Outdoor monthly air temperature (C)'\n]\n\nDtypes = {\n'Publication (Citation)':'string','Season':'category','Koppen climate classification':'category',\n'Climate':'category','City':'category','Country':'category','Building type':'category',\n'Sex':'category','Thermal preference':'category'\n}\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/ashrae-global-thermal-comfort-database-ii/ashrae_db2.01.csv',usecols=cols, dtype = Dtypes, low_memory=False, na_values=['Nan','Na','NaN','N/A','na'])\n\ndf.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Lets check that it works as we expected.\n\nprint(df.shape)\nprint(df.dtypes)\nprint(df.info)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, there's a lot of NaN data in our system - something we'll need to take into account when performing our analysis. \n\nWe have some 107,585 entrys - so it's quite a large and impressive dataset!","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#How many unique publications?\n\nprint('There are ' + str(df['Publication (Citation)'].nunique()) + ' unique publications.')\n\n#How many unique cities?\n\nprint('There are ' + str(df['City'].nunique()) + ' unique cities.')\n\n#What range of years?\n\nprint('The range of years is from ' + str(df['Year'].min()) + ' to ' + str(df['Year'].max()) + '.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's a good thing that we have so many entries - we'll probably need to subset quite significantly - otherwise we might accidently capture trends in time or city.\n\nGiven how many publications, we'll also need to see how consistant they are - or if they have any biases.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic Stats\n\nLet's start by just looking at the basics.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's examine some basic stats\n\ndf.describe()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Whilst not particularly useful, this does provide some helpful data for our ranges.

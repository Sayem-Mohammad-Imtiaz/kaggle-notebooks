Any suggestions about the notebook is most welcome and upvote if you find it useful.\n\nThe data contains the following information:\n\n* Country- this is the country for which the vaccination information is provided;\n* Country ISO Code - ISO code for the country;\n* Date - date for the data entry; for some of the dates we have only the daily vaccinations, for others, only the (cumulative) total;\n* Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;\n* Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;\n* Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;\n* Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;\n* Daily vaccinations - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that date/country;\n* Total vaccinations per hundred - ratio (in percent) between vaccination number and total population up to the date in the country;\n* Total number of people vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n* Total number of people fully vaccinated per hundred - ratio (in percent) between population fully immunized and total population up to the date in the country;\n* Number of vaccinations per day - number of daily vaccination for that day and country;\n* Daily vaccinations per million - ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date in the country;\n* Vaccines used in the country - total number of vaccines used in the country (up to date);\n* Source name - source of the information (national authority, international organization, local organization etc.);\n* Source website - website of the source of information"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d7549523-77bd-4562-a45e-3eb1781ad4c3","_cell_guid":"23340140-d285-4d2e-98b3-08ebb8dbae9c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/covid-world-vaccination-progress/country_vaccinations.csv\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#A country which doesn't have ISO code will be marked as UNKNOWN and Null numbers will be replaced with 0\ndf['iso_code'] = df['iso_code'].fillna('Unknown')\ndf = df.fillna(0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_vaccine = df.groupby([\"country\",\"vaccines\"])['total_vaccinations','total_vaccinations_per_hundred', 'daily_vaccinations','daily_vaccinations_per_million'].max().reset_index()\ndf_vaccine","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig=px.choropleth(df_vaccine, locations='country',locationmode='country names', color='total_vaccinations').update_layout(title='Total Vaccinations')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig=px.choropleth(df_vaccine, locations='country',locationmode='country names', color='daily_vaccinations').update_layout(title='Daily Vaccinations')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig=px.choropleth(df_vaccine, locations='country',locationmode = 'country names', color='vaccines').update_layout(title='Vaccines in Action')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Countries with high total vaccination rate\ndf_htvr=df_vaccine.sort_values(by='total_vaccinations',ascending=False).head(10)\ndf_htvr","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#top total vaccinated countries and vaccinations used \nfig = px.sunburst(df_htvr, path=['country', 'vaccines'], values='total_vaccinations')\nfig.update_layout(title= \"Top Total Vaccinated Countries and Vaccines Used\")\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Countries with low total vaccination rate\ndf_ltvr=df_vaccine.sort_values(by='total_vaccinations').head(10)\ndf_ltvr","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# less vaccinated countries and vaccinations used \nfig = px.sunburst(df_ltvr, path=['country', 'vaccines'], values='total_vaccinations')\nfig.update_layout(title=\"Less Total Vaccinated Countries and Vaccines Used\" )\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.line(df, x=\"date\", y=\"total_vaccinations\", color='country').update_layout(title='Total Vaccination Trend')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.line(df, x=\"date\", y=\"daily_vaccinations\", color='country').update_layout(title='Daily Vaccination Trend')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

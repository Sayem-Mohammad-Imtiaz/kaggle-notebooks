Our goal is to design a model that can predict the marks if number of hours studied is provided. Using the training data, a regression line is obtained which will give minimum error. This linear equation is then used to apply for a new data. That is, if we give the number of hours studied by a student as an input, our model should be able to predict their mark with minimum error.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"Model R^2: {model.score(X_test, y_test)}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

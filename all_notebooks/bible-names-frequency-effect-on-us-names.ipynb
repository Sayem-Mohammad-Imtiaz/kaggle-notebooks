The paper analyzises the data between 1880 and 2014 and will be\nlooking into questions how frequency occurrence of names in Bible correlate with US baby names.\n\n##Assumptions##\n\n1. Religious people are more affected by the Bible than non-religious.\n\n2. The frequency occurance of names in the Bible must correlate with frequency occurance of names\ngiven by religious people. \n\n3. The bigger correlation of frequency occurance of names in the Bible and in sample population,\nthe more religious sampled population is.\n\n4. Since Christianity and Judaism has different view on New and Old Testaments, the analysis will\nbe performed on both scripts separately.\n\n##Limitations##\nThe analysis doesn't take into account sentiment of the names in the Bible, for instance the weigth given\nto name _[Judas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot)_ is the same weight given to\n_[Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle)_, even though Judas has a negative\nsentiment and Paul a positive one.\n\n#Data Loading#\nThe US names data was provided by Kaggle and was downloaded using the following _[link](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names/downloads/us-baby-names-release-2015-12-18-00-53-48.zip)_.\n\nA list of Bible names were downloaded from _[MetaV repository](https://github.com/robertrouse/KJV-bible-database-with-metadata-MetaV-)_,\nwhich links together details on people, places, periods of time, and passages in the Bible at\nword-level detail. The file was downloaded using the following _[link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robertrouse/KJV-bible-database-with-metadata-MetaV-/master/CSV/People.csv)_.\n\nA text of New and Old Testaments was downloaded from _[Bible Text project](https://sites.google.com/site/ruwach/bibletext)_,\nwhich parses and divides the Bible into separate books and chapters. Both testaments were dowloaded\nusing the following links: _[New Testament](http://ruwach.googlepages.com/asv_NewTestament.zip)_,\n_[Old Testament](http://ruwach.googlepages.com/asv_OldTestament.zip)_.\n\nSince both New and Old Testaments are provided in a distributed form, where each chapter was put in\na separate file, a concatenation of files was performed using the following Bash script under\nappropriate folder:\n\nfind . -type f -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 cat > newTestament.txt\n\nfind . -type f -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 cat > oldTestament.txt\n\nAll datasets were uploaded to _[GitHub repository](https://github.com/aie0/data)_ under the\nfolder **bible**, as standalone files for retrieval convinience and reproducibility. Since Github\nimposes 100MB file size restriction, both US national and state names files were archived into a\nsingle zip file.

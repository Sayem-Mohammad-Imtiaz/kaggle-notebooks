Whenever your dataset records events over time, you want to take that into account as an added feature. For example, an event that happened an hour ago is probably more important than one that happened a year ago. Time can also capture trends, changing needs and perceptions, etc. We want to create features that capture all those time-evolving elements!\n\nFor each row of data, we’ll add two new features: the sum of bicycle rentals for the previous hour, and the sum of bicycle rentals from two hours ago. The intuition here is that if we want to understand the current bicycling mood, we can start by looking at what happened an hour ago. If the rentals were great one hour ago, they’re probably going\nto be good now. This time element can be seen as a proxy to prosperous or calamitous times, good or bad weather, etc.\nTo create a sum of bicycles per date and hour, we use Pandas extremely powerful “groupby()” function. We extract three fields, “dteday,” “hr,” and “cnt” and group the count by date and hour "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3b71e44c9fc98861d6930ac330a5e01ce86bbea8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# prior hours\nbikes_hour_df_shift = bikes_hour_df[['dteday','hr','cnt']].groupby(['dteday','hr']).sum().reset_index()\nbikes_hour_df_shift.sort_values(['dteday','hr'])\n# shift the count of the last two hours forward so the new count can take in consideratio how the last two hours went \nbikes_hour_df_shift['sum_hr_shift_1'] = bikes_hour_df_shift.cnt.shift(+1)\nbikes_hour_df_shift['sum_hr_shift_2'] = bikes_hour_df_shift.cnt.shift(+2)\n\nbike_df_model_ready =  pd.merge(bikes_hour_df, bikes_hour_df_shift[['dteday', 'hr', 'sum_hr_shift_1', 'sum_hr_shift_2']], how='inner', on = ['dteday', 'hr'])\n\n# drop NAs caused by our shifting fields around\nbike_df_model_ready = bike_df_model_ready.dropna()\n\noutcome = 'cnt'\n# create a feature list for each modeling -

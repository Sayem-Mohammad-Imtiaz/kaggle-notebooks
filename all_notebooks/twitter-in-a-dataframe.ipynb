This allows you to spend more time analyzig data, and less time figuring out the structure of the JSON response object. It's not complicated or anything, just takes time. \n2. **Manage looping and merging:** there is a limit to how many results you get per request (typically in the 100 - 200 range), several requests have to be made, and merged together. Not all responses have the same structure, so this is also handled. You only have to provide the number of responses you want through the `count` parameter where applicable (provided you are within your app's rate limits). \n3. **Unnesting nested objects:** Many response objects contain very rich embedded data, which is usually meta data about the response. For example, when you request tweets, you get a user object along with that. This is very helpful in better understanding who made the tweet, and how influential / credible they are.\n4. **Documentation:** All available parameters are included in the function signatures, to make it easier to explore interactively, as well as descriptions of the parameters imported from the Twitter documentation. \n\nThis module provides the ability to request data from Twitter but not to post it. If you want to tweet, follow someone or engage programmatically, you can do it directly through `twython`. This is mainly for retrieving and analyzing data.\n\n#### API\n\nUsing the API is almost identical to using it with `twython`. \nBelow is a quick comparison.  \nBefore starting you will have to create an app through [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/), and then you can get your authentication keys from your dashboard. \nThere are several ways to authenticate, depending on what you want to do and how your app is setup. You can learn more about that from [twython's documentation](https://twython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/starting_out.html)\n\n**To install: **\n\n`pip install advertools`","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ef7d4bc6a2e3ba7a22e8c606fc54382438c55341"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 60)\npd.set_option('display.max.columns', None) # 70+ columns to explore!

Keep this in mind.  \nIn cases where there are embedded data with the respnose, like user data, the column names will have a prefix of `tweet_` and `user_` for example to differentiate betweent them.  \nSome columns like `created_at` and `id` for example, have the same name for users and tweets, so this was done to make sure things are clear, and avoid duplication.

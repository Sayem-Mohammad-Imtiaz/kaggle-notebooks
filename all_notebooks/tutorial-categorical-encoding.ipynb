Categorical features contain a finite number of discrete values. How we represent these features will have an impact on the performance of our model. Like in other aspects of machine learning, there are no silver bullets. Determining the correct approach, specific to our model and data is part of the challenge.\n\nThis tutorial aims to cover a few of these methods. We begin by covering a straight-forward technique before tackling more complicated lesser-known approaches.\n\n**List of methods covered**:\n1. One-Hot Encoding\n2. Feature Hashing\n3.

In this tutorial we have chosen to use the latter.\n\n*Actually, it is seen as more correct to expand m categories into (m - 1) distinct features. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, if the values of (m - 1) features are known, the m-th feature can be inferred and secondly because including the m-th feature can cause certain linear models to become unstable. More on that can be found [here](https://www.algosome.com/articles/dummy-variable-trap-regression.html). In practice I think this depends on your model.

Data Frame.\n\nThe concept of a data frame comes from the world of statistical software used in empirical research; it generally refers to \"tabular\" data: a data structure representing cases (rows), each of which consists of a number of observations or measurements (columns). Alternatively, each row may be treated as a single observation of multiple \"variables\". In any case, each row and each column has the same data type, but the row (\"record\") datatype may be heterogenous (a tuple of different types), while the column datatype must be homogenous. Data frames usually contain some metadata in addition to data; for example, column and row names. ([source][1])\n\nSo, let's create our first Data Frame.In order to do this we gonna use Pandas, which we imported in first step, and Python's dict. Our Data Frame will consist of numbers ranging 0-9 and 10 chars 'a'.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/mobileink/data.frame/wiki/What-is-a-Data-Frame%3F"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f0dcd81a-231b-805f-f474-941551cf2275"},"outputs":[],"source":"frame = pd.DataFrame({'numbers':range(10), 'chars':['a']*10})"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"afaf8ca7-2fd2-5a53-ac43-c2c16b8cb7c1"},"source":"Let's have a  look at what we've got.

As you can see, we have two columns \"chars\" and \"numbers\" with rows. \n\nIn fact such kind of notation is rarely used. Most of the time we gona work with an external data from different files. So it would be more comfortable to read these data to Data Frame and then work with it as a table. Let's try to do it. For this porpose we have the special function called `pd.read_csv()`\n\nFirst argument of this func is a name of our file. In this tutorial I decided to use Happines Rank of different countries. Second argument is a number of a row where a header of table is placed. And the third one is a separator used in the file.

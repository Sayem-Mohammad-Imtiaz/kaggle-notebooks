The Games were first held in 1896 in Athens, Greece, and were most recently the 2020 Summer Olympics held in 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals are awarded for second place, and bronze medals are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904.\n\n![summer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg/270px-Olympic_rings_without_rims.svg.png)\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in 1896 to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in 2016.\n\nThe Games have been held four times in the United States (1904, 1932, 1984, and 1996), three times in Great Britain (1908, 1948, and 2012), twice each in Greece (1896 and 2004), France (1900 and 1924), Germany (1936 and 1972), Australia (1956 and 2000), and Japan (1964 and 2020) and once each in Sweden (1912), Belgium (1920), Netherlands (1928), Finland (1952), Italy (1960), Mexico (1968), Canada (1976), Soviet Union (1980), South Korea (1988), Spain (1992), China (2008), and Brazil (2016).\n\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics will be held in Paris, France for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected Los Angeles, California to host its third Summer Games in 2028, and Brisbane, Queensland, to host Australia’s third Olympics in 2032.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Importing

When the Olympic Games resumed after the war, Antwerp was awarded hosting the 1920 Summer Games as tribute to the Belgian people. The aftermath of the war and the Paris Peace Conference, 1919 affected the Olympic Games not only due to new states being created, but also by sanctions against the nations that lost the war and were blamed for starting it. Hungary, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were banned from competing in the Games. The newly formed Soviet Union chose not to attend the Games. Germany did not return to Olympic competition until 1928 and instead hosted a series of games called Deutsche Kampfspiele, starting with the Winter edition of 1922 (which predated the first Winter Olympics).\n\nThe United States won the most gold and overall medals.\n\nThe sailing events were held in Ostend, Belgium, and two in Amsterdam, Netherlands.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_1920=medals[medals['year']=='1920'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_1920","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.890537Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.891023Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.907438Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.89099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.906395Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_1920.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"BuPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.908665Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.908964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.144684Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:47.908933Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.143766Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_1920.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"BuPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.145829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.146143Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.363757Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.146113Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.362719Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_1920.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"BuPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.365175Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.365559Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.586238Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.365522Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.585066Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_1920.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"BuPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.58778Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.58822Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.803408Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.588184Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:48.802192Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals France-Paris - 1924</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 1924 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 1924), officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la VIIIe olympiade) and commonly known as Paris 1924, were an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in 1924 in Paris, France.\n\n![summer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/1924_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg/330px-1924_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\n\nIt was the second time Paris hosted the games (after 1900), becoming the first city to host the Olympics twice.

A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men, and 390 women in 19 sport disciplines. \nGermany and Japan were not invited to participate in the games; the Soviet Union was invited but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Olympics.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_1948=medals[medals['year']=='1948'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_1948","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.752333Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.752612Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.769828Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.752582Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.768664Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_1948.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"OrRd\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.771208Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.771528Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.004241Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:52.771498Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.003145Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_1948.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"OrRd\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.005635Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.005947Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.226306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.005917Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.225319Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_1948.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"OrRd\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.227697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.228028Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.455554Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.227995Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.454691Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_1948.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"OrRd\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.458011Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.458475Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.691356Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.458422Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:53.690292Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Finland-Helsinki - 1952</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 1952 Summer Olympics (Finnish: Kesäolympialaiset 1952; Swedish: Olympiska sommarspelen 1952), officially known as the Games of the XV Olympiad (Finnish: XV olympiadin kisat; Swedish: Den XV olympiadens spel) and commonly known as Helsinki 1952 (Swedish: Helsingfors 1952), were an international multi-sport event held from 19 July to 3 August 1952 in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n![summer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/cd/1952_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg/137px-1952_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\nAfter Japan declared in 1938 that it would be unable to host 1940 Olympics in Tokyo due to the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War, Helsinki had been selected to host the 1940 Summer Olympics, which were then cancelled due to World War II.

Melbourne is the most southerly city ever to host the Olympics. Due to the Southern Hemisphere's seasons being different from those in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1956 Games did not take place at the usual time of year, because of the need to hold the events during the warmer weather of the host's spring/summer (which corresponds to the Northern Hemisphere's autumn/winter). Australia did not host the Games again until 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, and will host them again in 2032 in Brisbane, Queensland.\n\nThe Olympic equestrian events could not be held in Melbourne due to Australia's strict quarantine regulations, so they were held in Stockholm five months earlier. This was the second time the Olympics were not held entirely in one country, the first being the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, with some events taking place in Ostend, Belgium and Amsterdam, Netherlands. Despite uncertainties and various complications encountered during the preparations, the 1956 Games went ahead in Melbourne as planned and turned out to be a success. The enduring tradition of national teams parading as one during the closing ceremony was started at these Olympics.\n\nEight teams boycotted the Games for various reasons. Four teams boycotted in response to the Suez Crisis where Egypt was invaded by Israel, France and the United Kingdom, three in response to the Soviet invasion of Hungary and one in response to the presence of the Republic of China at the Games.\n\nThe Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_1956=medals[medals['year']=='1956'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_1956","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.633446Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.633817Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.65039Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.633788Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.649288Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_1956.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"Paired\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.651906Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.652223Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.88887Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.652185Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.88797Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_1956.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"Paired\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.890022Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.89031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.119671Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:54.89028Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.118722Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_1956.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"Paired\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.12282Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.123132Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.351926Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.123103Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.350997Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_1956.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"Paired\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.353129Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.353419Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.57809Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.35339Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:18:55.577186Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Italy-Rome - 1960</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 1960 Summer Olympics (Italian: Giochi Olimpici estivi del 1960), officially known as the Games of the XVII Olympiad (Italian: Giochi della XVII Olimpiade) and commonly known as Rome 1960 (Italian: Roma 1960), were an international multi-sport event held from 25 August to 11 September 1960 in Rome, Italy. \n\n![summer](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/1960_Summer_Olympics_logo.png)\n\n\nRome had previously been awarded the administration of the 1908 Summer Olympics, but following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, the city had no choice but to decline and pass the honour to London.

Until 1960, South Africa had fielded segregated teams, conforming to the country's racial classifications; for the 1964 Games the International Olympic Committee demanded a multi-racial delegation to be sent, and after South Africa refused, they were excluded from participating. The country was, however, allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics, also held in Tokyo, its Paralympic Games debut.\n\n\nThe games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city's midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season.[6] The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather. The following games in 1968 in Mexico City also began in October. The 1964 Olympics were also the last to use a traditional cinder track for the track events.

The emblem of the 1984 Games, known as \"Stars in Motion\", featured red, white and blue stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks. The official mascot was Sam the Olympic Eagle. These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.\n\n![summer olympics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0c/1984_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg/330px-1984_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\nThe 1984 Games were boycotted by a total of fourteen Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union and East Germany, in response to the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; Romania was the only Eastern Bloc state that opted to attend the Games. Albania, Iran and Libya also chose to boycott the Games for unrelated reasons. Despite the field being depleted in certain sports due to the boycott, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, a record number at the time. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, followed by Romania and West Germany.\n\nThe 1984 Summer Olympics are widely considered to be the most financially successful modern Olympic Games, serving as an example on how to run a model Olympic games. As a result of low construction costs, due to the use of existing sport infrastructure, coupled with a reliance on private corporate funding, the 1984 Games generated a profit of over $250 million.\n\nOn July 18, 2009, a 25th-anniversary celebration of the 1984 Olympic Games was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The celebration included a speech by former Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee president Peter Ueberroth, as well as a re-enactment of the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics for the third time in 2028.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_1984=medals[medals['year']=='1984'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_1984","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.394304Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.394595Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.411667Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.394564Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.410546Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_1984.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"PuOr\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.41299Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.413271Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.646299Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.413242Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.645378Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_1984.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"PuOr\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.647524Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.647794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.872801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.647767Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.871756Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_1984.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"PuOr\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.874027Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.874317Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.096911Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:01.874286Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.095967Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_1984.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"PuOr\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.098057Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.098322Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.338111Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.098295Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:02.337005Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals South Korea-Seoul - 1988</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 1988 Summer Olympics (Korean: 1988년 하계 올림픽; RR: 1988nyeon Hagye Ollimpig), officially known as the Games of the XXIV Olympiad (Korean: 제24회 올림픽경기대회; RR: Je 24hoe Ollimpiggyeong-gidaehoe) and commonly known as Seoul 1988 (Korean: 서울 1988), was an international multi-sport event held from 17 September to 2 October 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. 159 nations were represented at the games by a total of 8,391 athletes (6,197 men and 2,194 women). 237 events were held and 27,221 volunteers helped to prepare the Olympics.\n\n![summer olympics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d6/1988_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg/225px-1988_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\n\nThe 1988 Seoul Olympics were the second summer Olympic Games held in Asia and the first time the Olympic Games were held in South Korea.

These were also the second Olympic Games to be held in spring and is to date the most recent games not to be held in its more traditional July or August summer slot.\n\nThe final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by Russia and China with host Australia at fourth place overall.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_2000=medals[medals['year']=='2000'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_2000","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.317174Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.317556Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.334461Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.317519Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.333294Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_2000.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"RdGy\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.335713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.336025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.564159Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.335992Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.563099Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_2000.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"RdGy\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.565342Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.565623Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.776058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.565594Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.775339Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_2000.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"RdGy\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.777206Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.777631Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.992101Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.777588Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.991368Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_2000.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"RdGy\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.993161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.993568Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.2Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:05.993528Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.199287Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals Greece-Athens - 2004</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 2004 Summer Olympics (Greek: Θερινοί Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 2004, Therinoí Olympiakoí Agónes 2004),[2] officially known as the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad (Greek: Αγώνες της 28ης Ολυμπιάδας, Agónes tis 28is Olympiádas) and commonly known as Athens 2004 (Greek: Αθήνα 2004), was an international multi-sport event held from 13 to 29 August 2004 in Athens, Greece. The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete, some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries. There were 301 medal events in 28 different sports. Athens 2004 marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also saw the return of the Olympic Games to the city where they began. Having previously hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896, Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles).\n\n![summer olympics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/16/2004_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg/215px-2004_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png)\n\nA new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens. This rectified the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.\n\nThe 2004 Olympic Games were hailed as \"unforgettable dream games\" by IOC President Jacques Rogge, in his first Olympic appearance as the president since succeeding Juan Antonio Samaranch after the 2000 Summer Olympics, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road, and subway system. There have been arguments (mostly in popular media) regarding the cost of the 2004 Summer Games and their possible contribution to the 2010–18 Greek government-debt crisis, but there is little or no evidence for such a correlation. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with Greece at 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were broken during these Games.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_2004=medals[medals['year']=='2004'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_2004","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.201029Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.201517Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.217668Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.201412Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.21667Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Gold' , data=medals_2004.sort_values(['Gold']),palette=\"RdPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.219157Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.219591Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.446612Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.219546Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.445675Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Silver' , data=medals_2004.sort_values(['Silver']),palette=\"RdPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.447779Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.44807Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.677945Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.448042Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.676937Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Bronze' , data=medals_2004.sort_values(['Bronze']),palette=\"RdPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.679228Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.679497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.907819Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.679469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.906821Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name', x='Total' , data=medals_2004.sort_values(['Total']),palette=\"RdPu\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.909207Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.909523Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:07.119844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:06.909492Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:07.119049Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"background-color:#B4DBE9; color:#636363;\">\n    <h1><right>Summer Olympic Medals China-Beijing - 2008</center></h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 2008 Summer Olympics (Chinese: 2008年夏季奥运会; pinyin: Liǎng qiān bā Nián Xiàjì Àoyùnhuì), officially known as the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (Chinese: 第二十九届夏季奥林匹克运动会; pinyin: Dì Èrshíjiǔ Jiè Xiàjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì) and commonly known as Beijing 2008 (Chinese: 北京2008; pinyin: Běijīng èr líng líng bā), was an international multisport event held from 8 to 24 August 2008 in Beijing, China.

Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).However, the event retained the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics.\n\nThe 2020 Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the Tokyo 1964 (Summer), Sapporo 1972 (Winter) and Nagano 1998 (Winter) games. Tokyo was the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China.\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports for 2020, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts.\n\nThe United States topped the medal count by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 88). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 65 medals, becoming the first nation at the Summer Olympics to increase or equal their total medals won in the two Games subsequent to hosting them. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan won their first-ever Olympic medals.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"medals_2020=medals[medals['year']=='2020'].drop(['year','Country_Code'],axis=1).head(10)\nmedals_2020","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-04T20:19:09.83495Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-04T20:19:09.835388Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-04T20:19:09.851483Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-04T20:19:09.835358Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-04T20:19:09.850366Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.barplot(y='Country_Name',

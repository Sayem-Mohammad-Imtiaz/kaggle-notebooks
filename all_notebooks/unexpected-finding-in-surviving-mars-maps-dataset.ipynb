The Surviving Mars Maps dataset contains a list of all the colony locations with their environmental conditions and breakthroughs available on each map.

In other words, does the Topography type \"Relatively Flat\" have an advantage over the other three types when it comes to indicators of advanced technology, like \"Advanced Drone Drive\", \"Artificial Muscles\", \"Forever Young\", and all the other good-sounding advances?\n\nTo answer the question, we must first decide what are indicators of a thriving city. Looking at the column names, it seems that all the boolean type columns are upgrades, meaning that if you were playing the game, then you'd eventually want your civilization to have these capabilities. If that's the case, we can simply check whether the flat topography, ostensibly better areas of the map for building cities, have more True than False in these columns."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the names of all boolean type columns\nbool_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['bool']).columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we have a list of all the columns of type bool, lets create a new column to hold the count of all the True values in those columns.

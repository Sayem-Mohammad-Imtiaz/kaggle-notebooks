{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Overview\n**Summary:** The 'Allen-Unger Global Commodity Prices' dataset is a vast collection of commodity prices from the 10th to 20th century. The 165 unique commodities include Agricultural (i.e., cheese, butter, salt), Energy (i.e., oil, coal, wood), and Industrial (i.e., iron, gold, copper) commodities valued in over 70 currencies and in nearly 200 locations across the globe. \nWhile there is a considerable breadth of data, 80% of the records are prices from European locations during the 15th – 19th centuries and over 40% of the data relates to grain prices. The authors of the dataset acknowledge that many series’ are not complete, and assumptions were made to standardize data across sources. Measures and currencies have been converted into standard values for comparability. \n\nThe dataset can be used to investigate both broad themes and specific event throughout the past 1,000 years. The presences of volatility in commodity prices in particular locations can signify macro events throughout history.\n\n\n**Question:** How did the British East India Company's (EIC) creation and involvement in the West Indies influence commodity prices in England. \n\n\n**Time period:** 1600 – 1875\n\n\n**Background:** While there is a distinct date for the formation of the EIC, other countries had established land and sea trade routes with the East. These foreign commodities came with significant tariffs and supply restrictions. \n\n\n**Hypothesis:** Imported commodities, such as tea, pepper, and ginger, will decrease in price and volatility in England as trade is established with the East through the British East India Company."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initial environment set up\nThere is one original CSV file in the original version of the dataset.

The trade with Asia was specific to spices, textiles, and tea. Additional trade routes were established further east (China, Japan) later in the 18th century. Keep in mind, other countries had established trade routes in the 16th century, but these countries imposed high tariffs on certain commodities. Further, the abundance of political instability proliferated throughout the 250 years following the creation of the EIC.

Ginger was primarily grown in the East Indies in the 1600s. Prices decreased significantly in the first hundred years (1600 - 1700) of the EIC. England saw significantly lower and more stable prices.\n\n\n* **Pepper**: Pepper had very similar characteristics and price movements as ginger. Pepper was previously available via Portuguese and Dutch traders. However, pepper carried significant foreign tax. The establishment of a nationalized trade route meant the British could see a reduced price. We’ll see this come out through the data.    \n\n\n* **Tea**: Data for tea begins in 1673 and is consistent through the 1800s. Tea was primarily sourced from China. The British saw steadily declining tea prices from the beginning of the dataset. The British built up a large deficit in the early day of the relationship, as the Chinese desired silver (rather than gold). In the late 1700s, the British used India to grow opium, which was illegal in China. As the Chinese became increasingly addicted to opium, the British exploited this relationship to export tea and eventually the silver. The Opium Wars in the 1830s and 1840s are macro factors to consider that will also influence prices.\n \nThe remaining analysis will focus only on indicative commodities.

As we've learned, opium was a dominate focus of the EIC. However, let's review historical evidence in conjunction with the pricing data to determine if the rise in prices in the early 1800, which is counter to our hypothesis, can be ruled out as counterevidence. Let's look at the ginger and pepper prices leading up to the turn of the 19th century."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"single_line (\"Ginger & Pepper\", df_GP, 1760, 1850)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see there was a distinct period around 1790 in which both commodity prices spiked significantly. The dominate opium trade is the likely reason. The EIC took over the opium monopoly in 1757 but needed to popularize the drug in China to drive addiction and thus demand. \n\nOur initial dataset does not contain opium prices (or quantities), but additional research shows the EIC increased Chinese opium imports from, “1,000 chests [1 chest = ~140 lbs.] in 1767 and then to about 10,000 per year between 1820 and 1830. By 1838 the amount had grown to some 40,000 chests imported into China annually” [1]. \nAnother source cites demand in light of the Chinese opium ban as, “opium exports from India to China rose from just 75 mt [metric tons] in 1775 to just under 300 mt by 1800 and more than 2,500 mt by 1839” [2].  \n\nConverting these final metrics, we can corroborate that about 5.5 million pounds of opium were imported annually into China in the late 1830s. \nAlong with the addictive nature of opium, one source cites that demand was fueled by the EIC’s loss of its monopoly, beginning as early as 1813, causing opium to be even more prevalent in China. [2]\n\nFurther, historical references cite Bengal, among other regions, as a primary source of opium production. “In Bengal, the land designated for opium growing stretched for 500 miles with more than a million registered farmers growing opium plants for the East India Company in 500,000 acres of prime land\" [3]. \n\nBengal has a climate that can also be used to grow ginger and pepper. Additioanlly, there are multiple accounts of the British forcing local farmers into the production of opium around the turn of the century. The lack of supply of ginger and pepper, due to a shift to opium production, was likely the primary reason for ginger and pepper’s price increases. Another contributing factor can be found in the transportation constraints:\n\n> The opium trade became so important that traditional ships were no longer sufficient to bear the volume of the flow. They were superseded in the 1830s by specially designed ‘opium clippers’ which were heavily armed to protect their high-value cargo from pirates (or the Chinese authorities) and much faster than traditional ships [2]\n\nThe EIC couldn’t deliver the large quantities of opium to the Chinese quick enough, and even went as far as to design new ships specifically for opium transport. This immense effort likely diverted transportation resources for British imports and caused ginger and pepper prices in England to increase during this period. The invention of opium-specific cargo ships in the 1830s likely freed up previously used ships to resume non-opium commodities imports to England. Thus, explain the increase and decrease in prices through these historical events.\n\nUsing this information we can dismiss ginger and pepper as indicative commodities as the rise of opium production began in India. \n\n\n[1] https://www.britannica.com/topic/opium-trade <br>\n[2] https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr/WDR_2008/WDR2008_100years_drug_control_origins.pdf<br>\n[3] https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a5c8/58b8a481cd61a4bd6484ba1e4b438f304ee2.pdf\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Quantifying the results \n\nWhile the visual representations are compelling, we can quantify the impact by looking at the minimum, maximum, and percentage change for the 20-year rolling 'Standard Value' mean and standard deviations."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#stats function\n\ndef stats  (com1, data_frame, start_date, end_date):\n    \n    df_H = data_frame\n    df_H = df_H[df_H.Item_Year <= end_date]\n    df_H = df_H[df_H.Item_Year >= start_date]\n\n    #rolling average\n    ra_yearx = df_H.loc[df_H['Ave_20'].idxmax()]['Item_Year']\n    ra_valuex = round(df_H.loc[df_H['Ave_20'].idxmax()]['Ave_20'],2)\n    ra_yearm = df_H.loc[df_H['Ave_20'].idxmin()]['Item_Year']\n    ra_valuem = round(df_H.loc[df_H['Ave_20'].idxmin()]['Ave_20'],2)\n    \n    \n    print (f'{com1} \\n----------------------------------------------')\n    print (f'The maximum 20-year rolling average price for {com1} occurred in {ra_yearx} with a value of {ra_valuex}')                \n    print (f'The minimum 20-year rolling average price for {com1} occurred in {ra_yearm} with a value of {ra_valuem}')\n    print (\"----------------------------------------------------- \")\n    \n    #st.d \n    st_yearx = df_H.loc[df_H['STD_20'].idxmax()]['Item_Year']\n    st_valuex = round(df_H.loc[df_H['STD_20'].idxmax()]['STD_20'],2)\n    st_yearm = df_H.loc[df_H['STD_20'].idxmin()]['Item_Year']\n    st_valuem = round(df_H.loc[df_H['STD_20'].idxmin()]['STD_20'],2)\n                    \n    print (f'The maximum standard deviation occurred in {st_yearx} with a value of {st_valuex}')\n    print (f'The minimum standard deviation occurred in {st_yearm} with a value of {st_valuem}')\n    print (\"----------------------------------------------------- \")\n    \n\n    #changes \n    print (f'The 20-year rolling average price for {com1} decreased by {int(round(((ra_valuex - ra_valuem)/ra_valuex)*100,0))}% between its high in {ra_yearx} and low in {ra_yearm}') \n    print (f'The 20-year rolling standard deviation of {com1} decreased by {int(round(((st_valuex - st_valuem)/st_valuex)*100,0))}% between its high in {st_yearx} and low in {st_yearm}') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats (\"Ginger\", df_Ginger, 1580, 1700)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats (\"Pepper\", df_Pepper, 1580, 1700)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats (\"Tea\", df_Tea, 1580, 1850)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Each of our indicative commodities showed a significant decrease in price and standard deviation over the period.

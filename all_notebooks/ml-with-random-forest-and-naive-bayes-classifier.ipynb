For this project, I would like to answer four questions below. \n\nWhat kind of relations exist between variables in this data set?\nHow two group of being undefault and default differ ?\nIs the relationship between job category and default independent ?\nWhat factors affect being default greatly? and what are criterion to predict whether new clients who want to use equity loan could be default or not.\nBy answering these four questions, it would be very helpful for a bank or some institutions that issue home equity loan to automate the process of issuing home equity loan and know whether obligers that can not pay the loan back and factors that affect being default. Because of this reason, it is worth of doing the project and it is very meanigful to answer these four questions above.\n\n**About the data set**\n\nThe data that I would like to use is about a home equity loan. The data can be downloaded in a form of CSV from this website https://www.kaggle.com/ajay1735/hmeq-data. The size of data is 5960 raws and 13 columns. For this data set, time period is not mentioned from kaggle and the orginal website that the data comes from \n\nThe data set has the following characteristics: \n\n● BAD: 1 = client defaulted on loan 0 = loan repaid \n\n● LOAN: Amount of the loan request \n\n● MORTDUE: Amount due on existing mortgage \n\n● VALUE: Value of current property \n\n● REASON: DebtCon = debt consolidation; HomeImp = home improvement \n\n● JOB: Occupational categories \n\n● YOJ: Years at present job \n\n● DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports \n\n● DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines \n\n● CLAGE: Age of oldest credit line in months \n\n● NINQ: Number of recent credit inquiries \n\n● CLNO: Number of credit lines \n\n● DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio \n\nAll of unit for money is $**\n\n\n**Cleaning the data set**\n\nThere are many raws having missing value. Therefore, I drop the data that have missing value. The original data set is 5960 raws. After droping the data with missing value, the data size is 3364. The method that I use to do it is dropna.

In addition, low correlation betwen VALUE an LOAN(amount of the loan requested) shows the characteristic of the home equity loan in which the owners of high value of home does not need the home equity loan and people who suffer from money are likely to become obligoer of home equity loan. Besides, among pairs of variables such as LOAN,VALUE, YOJ, if one variable in pair has excessed value, the obligoers of the home equity loan are likely to be default.\n\n**Question 2 : How two group of being undefault and default differ ?**\n\nIn comparison of the two groups of being default and undefault based on the numerical variables, there are not big differnce between LOAN (amount of the loan requested),MORTDUE(amount due on existing mortgage) and VALUE(value of current property).However, there is a significant difference of DELOG(Number of major derogatory reports),DELINQ(Number of delinquent credit lines) and DEBTINC(Debt to income ratio)between two groups of being default and undefault. In fact, the mean value of DEROG for default group is about 6 times as high as the one for undefault group. In addition, the mean value of DELINQ for default group is about 4 times higher than the one for undefault group. Besides,the group of being default has higher debt to income ratio by 6% than the one of being undefault. This means that people who can not return the loan back are prone to have higher number of derogatory reports. In addition, The high number of deliquent credit lines tend to lead to the obligor being default. Based on this result, if there are high number of deliquent credit lines and derogatory reports, banks or some institution who are lending hoem equity loan should keep an eye on these obligor carefully and take some measurement in order to prevent them from losiing the money that they are ledning\n\n**Question 3 : Is the relationship between job category and default independent ?** \n\nThe relationship between job category and default independent based on the result of chi square test. This means that what job the obligoer have affect whether they are able to pay the money of home equity loan back or not. In addtion, people that mange their own company tend to have larger amount of loan request,amount of due on exsiting mortgage and value of current property than other jobs. Besides, by looking at bar plot of CLAGE and JOB, range of self is very small. This shows that people who mange their own company tend to able to pay the equity loan back very shortly\n\n**Question 4 :What factors affect being default greatly? and what are criterion to predict whether new clients who want to use equity loan could be default or not.** \n\nAccording the results from decition tree,random forest and Naive Bayes classifer, the highest accuracy rate is the one with random forest among three methods, which is 99% to predict about being default or undefault. From the feature importance of random forest, DEBTINC(Debt income ratio) and CLAGE(Age of oldest credit line in months) are important to classfy the samples. In addition, desition tree is also helpful to support the interpretation of clasification. Although the acuracty rate of clasification of desition tree is lower than random forest, the desition tree shows us criterions to clasify samples and future data. Based on the visualzied desition tree above, banks or some institutions issuing home equity loan could automate the process of issuing home equity loan and predict the futre possible clients could be default or not at 93% accuracy."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

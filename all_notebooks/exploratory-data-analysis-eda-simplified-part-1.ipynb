But you have no idea where to start. As you love to read books, you have planned to buy books regarding the subject. So, now you need to go to stores and find the best books to learn. But you don't know which books are for beginners. Now you are in a dilemma.\nIt will now lead you to a state where you will find yourself baffled with a lot of concerns that need to be answered to make the decision. To make the decision, you need to know some information like \n* which books are for beginners, \n* which books have explained the theory or the practical implementation well, \n* which books are organized, which books have a good rating, and so on.\n\n\nThe analyzing measures, you would take before finally buying the book is called â€˜**Exploratory Data Analysis**.\n\nIn short,\n\n# EDA is the process of analyzing the data to find and understand necessary patterns which then will be used to build machine learning models.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To perform EDA with python, we will need to import some libraries.

Before introducing the types, you need to understand some terms.\n> Univariate: Uni indicates one and variate stands for the variable. So, when the data consists of only one variable, then it is called univariate.\n\n> Multivariate: Multi indicates more than one and variate represents variable. Multivariate data arises from more than one variable.\n\n> Graphical: It means using plots(Like histogram, stem and leaf plot, and box plots) and figures to understand the data easily.\n\n> Nongraphical: Using different statistical techniques to understand the distribution(like, center, spread, modality, shape and outliers) ,central tendency(include Mean, Median, Mode) and measures of spread(include variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range) of the data.\n\nSo, the four types of EDA are,\n* Univariate non-graphical\n* Univariate graphical\n* Multivariate nongraphical\n* Multivariate graphical\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Exploratory Data Analysis**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are some steps that we always follow in EDA.

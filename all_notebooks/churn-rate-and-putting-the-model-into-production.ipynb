Negative relation means that likeliness of churn decreases with that variable.\n\n**To summarize:**\n\nTotal charges, internet services and seniority, for example, can lead to higher churn rates.

Bellow we'll give some information of why we used them. We are trying to predict a categorical variable which represent a customer is `Churn` or `Non-Churn`, then to do that we had to trainned our classifiers with three differents algorithms, bellow we will explain our choice.\n\n***Random Forest:***\n\nRandom forests are a powerful method with several advantages and can fit our model very well, we give some advantages and disadvantages bellow:\n\n* Both training and prediction are very fast, because of the simplicity of the underlying decision trees. In addition, both tasks can be straightforwardly parallelized, because the individual trees are entirely independent entities.\n* The multiple trees allow for a probabilistic classification.\n* The nonparametric model is extremely flexible, and can thus perform well on tasks that are under-fit by other estimators.\n* A primary disadvantage of random forests is that the results are not easily interpretable: that is, if you would like to draw conclusions about the meaning of the classification model, random forests may not be the best choice.\n\n***Logistic Regression:***\n\nLogistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary) as in our case to predict `Churn` or `Non-Churn`. Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.\n\nTo summarize, logistic regression allow us to predict labels of a target feature, even though the feature depends of several other features, giving us good prediction.\n\n***Support Vector Machine:***\n\nSupport vector machines are a powerful classification method for a number of reasons:\n\n* Their dependence on relatively few support vectors means that they are very compact models, and take up very little memory.\n* Once the model is trained, the prediction phase is very fast.\n* Because they are affected only by points near the margin, they work well with high-dimensional data‚Äîeven data with more dimensions than samples, which is a challenging regime for other algorithms.\n* Their integration with kernel methods makes them very versatile, able to adapt to many types of data.\n\nHowever, SVMs have several disadvantages as well:\n\n* The scaling with the number of samples $N$ is $\\mathcal{O}[N^3]$ at worst, or $\\mathcal{O}[N^2]$ for efficient implementations. For large numbers of training samples, this computational cost can be prohibitive.\n* The results are strongly dependent on a suitable choice for the softening parameter $C$. This must be carefully chosen via cross-validation, which can be expensive as datasets grow in size.\n* The results do not have a direct probabilistic interpretation. This can be estimated via an internal cross-validation, but this extra estimation is costly.\n\nBased on this explanations, we chose this three algorithms to perform about our dataset, every one has advantages and disadvantages also. SVM is a good algorithm but sometimes needs much time to train. Random Forest are very good but sometimes can lead us to overfitting problems. Lastly, Logistic Regression is always a good method to classifications problems combined with Cross Validation can give us best results."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"48fbf9e65a1f8fc1b4043607772be0cbc87d6414"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**4)** Bias and variance dilemma. Here is the most important thing to understand about our results. We've trained our models, chose our hyperparameters but\nwe need a way to validate that our model and our hyperparameters are a good fit to the data. When you trained a model and the model fits very well, with accuracy about 98%, for example, maybe there are some problems with. Maybe your model are suffering of **high variance problem**, its happens when your model fits your data very well, **overfitting** your model. But, when you try to predict something that is little different of your train set you got a reasonable error.\n\nOn the other hand, when you trained model and the model fits very poorly, with low accuracy, and don't matter how big your train dataset is, you always take low accuracy, probabily you are suffering of **underfitting** problem. In this case we need to add new features to our train set to improve our accuracy.\n\nBellow we have a picture that explains itself, relationing the bias and variance dilemma.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*xwtSpR_zg7j7zusa4IDHNQ.png)\n\nOur approach to solve this problem consists in two methods **holdout sets** and **cross-validation**. Holdout set consists in hold back some subset of the dataset from the training of the model, and then use this holdout set to check the model performance. This was the tecnique that we used here in our models, besides Linear Regression Lasso that we used cross-validation.\n\nOne disadvantage of using a holdout set for model validation is that we have lost a portion of our dataset to the model training. Sometimes holdout-set can cause some problems, because we lose a portion of our data to train our model, and when the dataset is small it can lead us to bias or variance problems. One way to address this is to use cross-validation; that is, to do a sequence of fits where each subset of the data is used both as a training set and as a validation set. \n\nWe used here holdout set to attempt avoid underfitting and overfitting problems. After we will drop some features in a attempt to improve our scores.\n\nIn next cells we see how our models scores and we can understand better how models."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d16a846223e32d176d77e1fef9bceff04993ed4d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**5)** Bellow we look for how accurate our models are.

In our analysis we trained a model that predicts if the customer will be a churn or non-churn customer, so we trained a static model.

(and how will I collect and store the additional data from interactions)\n* How frequently do I plan on re-training my model?\n* What are the data preprocessing needs?\n* Will the format of the production input data differ drastically from the model training data? Will it come in batches or as a stream?\n* Does the model need to be able to run offline?\n\nTo create an application we have to export our Python model, using a `pickle` library, this library makes it easy to serialize the models into files that I create. To deploy our model we can create a server, in this case a chose to create a `FLASK` server to run my model. The Flask Python framework allows us to create web servers in record time.\n\nOnce we had setup our server we can add our model to server. To do that we have to load our model in our application. Our application receives an array of features and put in our model. The model's prediction is then sent back to the user. In `python` we code something like this:\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport flask\n\napp = flask.Flask(__name__)\n\n#getting our trained model from a file we created earlier\nmodel = pickle.load(open(\"model.pkl\",\"r\"))\n\n@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\ndef predict():\n    #grabbing a set of wine features from the request's body\n    feature_array = request.get_json()['feature_array']\n    \n    #our model rates the wine based on the input array\n    prediction = model.predict([feature_array]).tolist()\n    \n    #preparing a response object and storing the model's predictions\n    response = {}\n    response['predictions'] = prediction\n    \n    #sending our response object back as json\n    return flask.jsonify(response)\n```\nOur application is running as an on-demand offline application.

In our analysis we saw that we customers that have contracts until one year have the most churn rate, they chose by month-to-month contracts. Why people give up to continue with the company?\n\nTo encourage our customers we can create some **reward mechanism**, for example:\n\n* Customers who chose one-year contracts can earn some discounts, for example, we can start the contract with the same value to month-to-month contract and decrease some percentage of the values over the months.\n* We saw that people who have more optional services, as optical fiber pay more and people who pays more is more likely to churn the company. So, we can create some packages with most used optional services and encourage our customers to chose it, give some discounts.\n* People who chose to pay with online methods can be encouraged, because they decrease expenses to company, and maybe earn some discounts.\n\nThe basic thing to do is build a solid relationship *company-customer* to show to our customer that he is a part of the company, and that how much they consume more discounts they will have.

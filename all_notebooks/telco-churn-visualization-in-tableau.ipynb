The total charge showed that the customer who stayed are already spent almost  1000  more than churn customer on average.\n\nThe stacked bar chart showed the number of churn customer and stayed customer on the number of tenure month. we can clearly see that there are large number of customers left the business within first few months. we can conclude that the customer has more willingness to stay if they already use the service for long time.  For example, 61.99% of customer left the company after one month, and only 1.66% of customer who already used the service for 72 months left the business last month \nThe line chart shows the relationship between churn rate and tenure month, we can spot a clear downward trend.

It could be caused by many reasons. The customer's new customer promotion might be expired, and the customer may add more services to their account could also cost higher monthly. On conclusion, we can reject the hypothesis that **the longer you stay, the cheaper you pay.**\n\n**The bar charts shows the churn rate in specific services. The red percentage shows the churn rate and the dollar amount is the average monthly charge on average is the customer choose particular service.**\n\nFor example, we can find that fiber optic is expensive and it lead to really high churn rate. Furthermore, we can see that the churn rate is low with tech support but really high without tech support, but the customer pays more monthly charge on average with tech support."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"08efc4b06005dbc8dd35157945919ea49f1fc528"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On chart 3 , \n**The bar charts shows the churn rate in specific services.

We can't even survive without water for few days. But we have a huge source of water. Water covers majority portion of the Earth.\n\n> Though üíß water is the most abandant resource on the Earth, still only about 2% water can be used for drinking. Now, the 2% also contains suspended solids, sulfates, organic carbon, etc. and if their portions increases more than specified value, this water can't be used for drinking. So the most abandant resource resource on the Earth, which covers 70% of our planet and we can't use it!\n\n> The üéØ aim of this exercise is to find out which parameter influences the potability of water and to differntiate potable and non potable water using a ML model.\n\n> This notebook as the title suggests covers the EDA and ML for the dataset. I am using [PyCharet library](https://pycaret.org/guide/), which a user friendly auto ML library and can save your ton of time.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Run this `!pip install pycaret` before proceeding","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-02T16:13:51.541765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-02T16:13:51.542084Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-02T16:14:36.569467Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-02T16:13:51.542055Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-02T16:14:36.568563Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pycaret","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:56:40.41488Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:56:40.415271Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:57:23.952295Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:56:40.415191Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:57:23.951365Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom pycaret.classification import *\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nsns.set(font = 'Serif', style = 'white', rc = {'axes.facecolor':'#f1f1f1', 'figure.facecolor':'#f1f1f1'})\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:58:08.28833Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:58:08.288674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:58:13.34651Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:58:08.288639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:58:13.345658Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><center>Let's dive into the Data üèä</center></h1>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/water-potability/water_potability.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:58:15.027427Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:58:15.027894Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:58:15.098007Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:58:15.027856Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:58:15.097133Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking the data types\ndf.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:58:21.615408Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:58:21.615774Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:58:21.63066Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:58:21.615742Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:58:21.629698Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 'Potability' is a categorical feature, so changing it's data types from int to category\ndf['Potability'] = df['Potability'].astype('category')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:58:42.55245Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:58:42.552826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:58:42.558328Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:58:42.552792Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:58:42.557347Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Looking for the missing values\ndf.isnull().sum()*100/len(df)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-06T08:59:08.270893Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-06T08:59:08.271252Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-06T08:59:08.281469Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-06T08:59:08.271203Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-06T08:59:08.280147Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> `ph` and `Trihalomethanes` have less than 20% missing values, so they can be imputed.

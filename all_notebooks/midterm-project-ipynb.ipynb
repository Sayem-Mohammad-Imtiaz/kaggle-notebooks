There has been heightened debate in recent weeks on the possible usage of face shields or eyeglasses to aid in exiting lockout and preventing more surges in Covid-19 infections.\n\nFace shields are visors made of plastic that cover the whole face. While this form of face covering has the potential to be critical in combating the infection, there are many myths on how they function.\n\nFace shields give the wearer an additional layer of security. Due to the fact that they shield the whole face – lips, nose, and eyes – a large proportion of viral particles are blocked from touching the wearer. Face shields are arguably the most effective method of defending against coughs and sneezes.\n\nAlthough face shield help liberate out against transmission of the coronavirus, experts advise considering your eyes as well. Eyeglasses could also be a protection to be used aside from using face shields. Eyeglasses can be a substitute to protect the eyes from polluted respiratory droplets.\n\nShields may thus be very helpful for anyone who come into near conjunction with others on a daily basis – for example, in medical environments. They are also extremely vulnerable in careers that rely heavily on nonverbal communication via facial expressions, such as teaching. They can be beneficial in providing teachers with security and trust, allowing them to return to the classroom atmosphere.\n\n**PROBLEM**\nDue to the arising of Covid Cases in our country, the safety protocol is strictly implemented to reduce the aftermath of coronvirus. With this, faceshields and eyeglasses is highly required in going out in our own premises.\n\n**OBJECTIVES/SOLUTION**\n*  The detection of face shield and eyeglasses to maintain the orderliness and safety of a person is such a benefecial way to deteriorate the cases in our country.\n*  By the use of detection of face shield or eyeglasses in a person who worned it and for those who don't can be a solution to give an alert or warning to the violators.\n* Create a model that will be able (detect/predict/classify) whether the person is wearing a faceshield or eyeglasses, it will predict and accept. It will also classify whether the person is not wearing either one of the two condition(wearing faceshield or eyeglasses. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**DATA**\n\n**Dataset:**   \n* Glasses or No Glasses Images\n* Faceshield or No Facsehield Images\n\n**Faceshield used:** \n* Clear Typed Faceshield\n\n****Faces in images used were taken from various person(Image dataset are from Kaggle)***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Methodology**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Methods for Solution**\n> **I.

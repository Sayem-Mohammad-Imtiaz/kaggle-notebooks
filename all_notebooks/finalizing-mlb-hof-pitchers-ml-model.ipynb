Include postseason stats and other stats that weren't included in this model.\n4. Changing the paramaters to fine tune the model- I have some other machine learning notebooks that show how to do this\n5. Try a different type of model, ex. random forest regressor\n6. Instead of predicting percent of the vote, try making it a bunary classification problem. That is, rather than predict a numerical value and determine if that warrants a HOF induction, simply predict whether or not a player will get inducted into the HOF.\n7. The data used for this project is dated. Data through 2020 will help create a better model. It may be hard to find that data, however, and the data for this project was already avaialable on kaggle which made it easier to use\n8. There are more ways to help improve the model as these are just what come to mind. The other notebooks show how I combined data from different datasets to create the data for this model, and how I decided which features to put in the model.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

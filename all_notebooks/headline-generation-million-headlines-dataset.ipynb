We want to be able to generate text over and over again until... when? Maybe when we generate 10 words, we call it quits. Would that be desirable though? No, since most sentences/titles are not just ten words; some have more words, some fewer. Also, stopping generation after a fixed number of words may result in text that is abruptly cut. To avoid these problems, we are going to ask the model when to stop generation. How? We will add a stop token and the model will learn to predict it like any other word. So, we are going to add a special end character at the end of each training item. We will also add another special character at the start of each item, to denote the beginning of each sentence.\n\nThese special characters are simply '÷' and '■' (start/end respectively)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"START = '÷'\nEND = '■'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After appending the start and end tokens, we are going to tokenize our text using the `keras` built-in libraries.

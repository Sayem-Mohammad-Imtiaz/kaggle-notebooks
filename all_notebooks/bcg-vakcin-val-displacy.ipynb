August 24 - 09:15 AM: Number of infections increases to 5,191\n\nThe number of confirmed people infected with the coronavirus in Hungary now stands at 5,191. In compulsory home quarantine:7,917. Recovered: 3,695. Deceased: 613.\n\nThe total number of active COVID-19 cases is 883. The results show that 35 percent of those infected, 60 percent of the deceased, and 43 percent of those recovered live in Budapest. There are currently 59 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus, nine of whom are on ventilators.\n\nAugust 24 - 09:03 AM: Chief Security Advisor: Stricter border controls will keep the coronavirus out\n\nHungary's chief security advisor said imposing border controls is the most effective way to prevent the import of the novel coronavirus from abroad.\n\nGyorgy Bakondi told public news channel M1 that the epidemic is worsening across Europe, including countries close to Hungary and this forces the government to tighten border restrictions from September.\n\nBakondi said these measures will not be new to the public, noting that similar restrictions were imposed during the height of the epidemic in the spring. “The important thing is for Hungarians to be aware that such a plan is in the works and for them to arrange their trips in a way that they comply with tightened border controls which could create difficult situations when one is leaving or entering the country,” \n\nThe government will do everything in its power to keep the virus outside the country and prevent its import from abroad either by Hungarians or foreigners, he added. To this end, border controls, screenings and quarantine rules must be tightened and the government must review its classification of countries according to the prevalence of Covid-19. http://abouthungary.hu/news-in-brief/coronavirus-heres-the-latest/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR5P_t87F_CYl8jToycwTSbsezOTJ5hmPHuVQ&usqp=CAU)newyork.mfa.gov.hu","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The impact of the BCG vaccination program in Hungary on the tuberculosis problem in children\n\nAuthors: I. Vadász & È.

Findings provide chance to study pathogens from a time before antibiotics. \n\nBritish scientists have recovered tuberculosis DNA from a 200 year-old Hungarian mummy.

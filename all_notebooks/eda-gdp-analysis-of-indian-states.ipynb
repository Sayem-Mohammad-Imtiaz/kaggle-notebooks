The CEO has initiated a project wherein the NITI Aayog will provide top-level recommendations to the Chief Ministers (CMs) of various states, which will help them prioritise areas of development for their respective states. Since different states are in different phases of development, the recommendations should be specific to the states.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to help the CMs focus on areas that will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, we will analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.\n\n## Understanding GDP\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) at current prices is the GDP at the market value of goods and services produced in a country during a year. In other words, GDP measures the 'monetary value of final goods and services produced by a country/state in a given period of time'.\n\nGDP can be broadly divided into goods and services produced by three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services).\n\nIt is also known as nominal GDP. More technically, (real) GDP takes into account the price change that may have occurred due to inflation. This means that the real GDP is nominal GDP adjusted for inflation. We will use the nominal GDP for this exercise. Also, we will consider the financial year 2015-16 as the base year, as most of the data required for this exercise is available for the aforementioned period.\n\n## Per Capita GDP and Income\n\nTotal GDP divided by the population gives the per capita GDP, which roughly measures the average value of goods and services produced per person. The per capita income is closely related to the per capita GDP (though they are not the same). In general, the per capita income increases when the per capita GDP increases, and vice-versa. For instance, in the financial year 2015-16, the per capita income of India was ₹93,293, whereas the per capita GDP of India was $1717, which roughly amounts to ₹1,11,605. \n\n## Data\n\nThe data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:\n\nData I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.\n\nData I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. \n\n\nThere are two parts to this project. In the first part, we analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, we divide the states into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, analyse the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).\n\nIn the second part, we analyse whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.\n\n\nNote: We filtered out the union territories (Delhi, Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc.) for further analysis, as they are governed directly by the centre, not state governments."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Importing the relavant libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part-I: GDP Analysis of the Indian States"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Part I-A:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the data\ndata1a = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/GSDP.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data1a.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Basic info regarding the data\ndata1a.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Observe the various columns in the dataset\ndata1a.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove the rows: (% Growth over the previous year)' and 'GSDP - CURRENT PRICES (in Crore) for the year 2016-17.\ndata1a = data1a[data1a['Duration'] != '2016-17']\ndata1a","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the total number of null values in each columns\ndata1a.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check if any column has all the values as NAN\ndata1a.isnull().all(axis=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# removing West Bengal as the whole column is NAN\ndata1a = data1a.drop('West Bengal1', axis = 1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data1a","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Calculating the average growth of states for the duration 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 by taking the mean of the row '(% Growth over previous year)'.

The major sub sectors contributing to the economy of the states are:\n    * Agriculture, Real Estate, Manufacturing, Trade Hotels and restraunts and Construction.\n    * One key observation is that for C1,C2 states the major contribution comes from Real Estate which is reasonable as these states have a big real estate and housing industry due to people migrating from villages to these states for employment.\n    * Agriculture forms the back-bone of the Indian economy and hence it features in the top 3 spot for all the category of states.\n    * India is home to some of the top hotels, restraunts and tourist destinations and hence these contribute significantly to the economy as well.\n    * Slowly but steadily India is working to increase its manufacturing capabilities and new companies are opening their factories in India which is the reason for manufacting appearing as a top contributor as well. The 'Make in India' initiative by PM. Modi is also helping to increase manufacturing activities in India.\n    * For any country to improve the standard of living of its people, it requires good quality infrastructure. India is experincing rapid urbanization with several new roads, bridges, ports etc. being constructed to aid in increasing the GDP of India which is growing very fast and people need good quality jobs. Construction provides jobs to several people and leads to people having better livelihood. \n    \n2. Sub-sectors for which states should pay invest more or pay greater attention:\n    * Improving Road, Railways, Air transpotation services will not only help in easier access for people to each and every nook and corner of India but also aid in transportation of goods and materials required for construction purposes.

Trade, repair, hotels and restaurants.\n            2. Transport, storage, communication & services for easier access to tourist destination.\n            3.

States like Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telengana are manufacturing hubs of India and thus should invest even more in the Manufacturing sector.\n            2.

Mining and quarrying should also be considered as these states have large deposits of natural resources.\n            3.

States like UP and Bihar should focus on investing in Public administration,Transport, storage, communication & services as they have a very large population and some people still live in remote places with mo direct access to the major cities .\n            2.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> COVID-19 - Search Engine with Bert Score </h1>\n\n![](https://cdn.drawception.com/drawings/661287/54Z1tooqg4.png)\n\nThis notebook is inspired by CORD-19 Solution Toolbox released by Gabriel Preda. Thanks for sharing!\n\nThe goal is really simple! We want to find the articles who talk about a specific topics. The idea of this notebook is to provide to the community the possiiblity to put in input a question, a topic (defined by keywords or sentences) or just keywords and use BERT to vectorize the input, vectorize the abstract of the articles and compare the similarity between them. Like that you can identify one or more articles who are a strong similarity (With cosinus similarity).\n\n# 1. Import & install the packages needed\n* \nWe have to install a package in order use BERT but for sentences. For that I use the package sentence transformers. Here you can find more informations: https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers. I am not here to explain BERT or Cosinu Similarity. You can find a lot of information about these topics. I want to stay pragmatic and give the possibility to re-use this notebook for other project."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U sentence-transformers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport scipy as sc\n\nimport os\nimport json\nimport warnings\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport time\n\nt = time.time()\nelapsed = time.time() - t\n\nclass Timer(object):\n    def __init__(self, name=None):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self.tstart = time.time()\n\n    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):\n        if self.name:\n            print('[%s]' % self.name,)\n        print('Elapsed: %s' % (time.time() - self.tstart))\n        \nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('bert-base-nli-mean-tokens')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Input - Questions or keywords\nIn this part of the notebook, you have to put the question or the keywords related to the topic that you want to identify through the research papers.

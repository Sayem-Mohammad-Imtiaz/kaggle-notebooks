We try  to classify patients as belonging to one out of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients).\n\n\n**WHAT IS KNN ALGORITHM?**\n\nK Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of the topmost machine learning algorithms. KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach.\n\n\n**KNN IN ACTION?**\n\nKNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or wonâ€™t vote.\n\n\nfor more:\nhttps://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/k-nearest-neighbor-classification-scikit-learn\n\n**AND STEPS?**\n\n* Import Data\n* Data Visualization\n* Feature Set\n* Normalize Data\n* Train Test Split\n* Classification\n* Training\n* Prediction\n* Accuracy Evaluation\n* How do we choose right K value?\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plot your data\n\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\nos.chdir(\"../input\")\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df= pd.read_csv('column_2C_weka.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"** EXPLOTARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['class'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['class'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**DATA VISUALIZATION **"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**FUTURE SET**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X=df.iloc[:,0:6].values\ny=df['class'].values\nX","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**NORMALIZE DATA**\n\nThe basic principle of k nearest neighbour is that it is a distance based algorithm.

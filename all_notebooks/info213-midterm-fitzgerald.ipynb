Additionally, the dataset is relevant to all of us as drivers and pedestrians within the city of Philadelphia. We understand the implications of driving and being able to use data to represent the risks of venturing out on the road is critical for many. This includes insurance carriers when determining rates, collision centers when determining where to open a location, and injury attorney offices. \n\nI would define and measure the outcomes from the dataset by focusing on a specific purpose or goal because there is so much information and attributes.

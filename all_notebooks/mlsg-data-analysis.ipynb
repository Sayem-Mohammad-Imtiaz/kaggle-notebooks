For example, your SQL query may have included a join which resulted in duplicates. If all records were duplicated then it's not a huge problem other than that you have too much data and training your model may take extra time. However if only some records are duplicated their effect on the model results will be enlarged.\n\nIn this example it's not straightforward that we're dealing with duplicates.

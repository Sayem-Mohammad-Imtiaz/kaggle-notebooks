Koramangala, Indiranagar, BTM are most popular locations among foodies.\n\n* Large number of votes can ensure better rating and 1K for 2 people is good to go price.\n\n* Bangalorian love fast food.\n\n* Providing online ordering can boast your chances.\n\n\nDetailed blog post about the business findings can be find here : https://medium.com/@shubh1795/starting-a-new-restaurant-in-bangalore-heres-what-you-should-know-e53bbce55a8"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

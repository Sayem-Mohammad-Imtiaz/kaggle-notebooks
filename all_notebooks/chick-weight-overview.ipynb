Crowder and David J. Hand. It is one of the datasets listed for the R software package, for the nlme package. The CSV file was found on Kaggle.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books/about/Analysis_of_Repeated_Measures.html?id=XsGX6Jgzo-IC\n\nhttps://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/ChickWeight.html\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/weight-vs-age-of-chicks-on-different-diets\n\nThe data was collected by a nutrition student, in order to test the effect of protein in 4 types of feed on early development of chicks. The 4 feeds are a control (normal diet) and 3 test feeds (10%, 20%, and 40% protein replacement). The assumption is that heavier, larger chicks are a benefit to farmers, and this type of data allows the food industry to advertise the advantages of their feed.\n\nFor example, this detailed web page by Purina Mills is designed to convince farmers to buy their feed, due to its health benefits. They emphasize that \"early growth requires the correct balance of nutrients\", and the first bullet point of the nutrients in their starter feed is that it has \"18% protein\". That page does not explain why 18% is a good number. Studies like this are needed to demonstrate why this is an advantage.\n\nhttps://www.purinamills.com/chicken-feed/education/detail/what-do-baby-chicks-eat-chick-starter-feed-is-key-for-lifetime-success\n\nI have not been able to find complete information about the dataset. It is obsolete (1990 textbook), but might be substantially older than that. The Google book web page has a scanned version of the pages with the data, but it does not have the book pages that list the sources, and I do not have the $60 book. However, the publisher of the book mentions: \"The book contains information obtained from authentic and highly regarded sources. Reprinted material is quoted with permission and sources are indicated.\"\n\nFor others (like myself) that are unfamiliar about the nutrition of recently hatched chicks, exploring the data is an opportunity to learn more about the domain of chicken development. The data itself has some unusual features, which the authors of the book did not explore.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"id":"gkmIxEUCNtKc","outputId":"f4bde7ad-5e0f-4429-ecef-81d804483389"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Colab seems to randomly crash.\n# I've had it crash on loading the CSV file, even though that works normally most of the time.\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport os # accessing directory structure\n\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/weight-vs-age-of-chicks-on-different-diets/ChickWeight.csv', delimiter=',')\ndf1.dataframeName = 'ChickWeight.csv'\ndf1.columns.values[0] = \"row_id\"\nnRow, nCol = df1.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\n# df1.head()  for some reason, this line is causing the notebook to crash without errors reported?","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"fnS-kSGYNtKz"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The study started with 50 chicks (id numbers range from 1-50).

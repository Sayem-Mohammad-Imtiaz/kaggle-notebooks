Generally, the data science project consists of seven steps which are problem definition, data collection, data preparation, data exploration, data modeling and model evaluation.In this project, I will go through these steps in order to build a heart disease classifier. To build the heart disease classifier by using UCI heart disease) dataset.\n\n## Dataset\n### The dataset has 14 attributes:\n### 1. age: age in years\n### 2. sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)\n### 3. cp: chest pain type (Value 0: typical angina; Value 1: atypical angina; Value 2: non-anginal pain; Value 3: asymptomatic)\n### 4. trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital\n### 5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n### 6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)\n### 7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal; Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; Value 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)\n### 8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved\n### 9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n### 10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n### 11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 0: upsloping; Value 1: flat; Value 2: downsloping)\n### 12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n### 13. thal: thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)\n### 14. target: heart disease (1 = no, 2 = yes)\n\n\n### Part2:

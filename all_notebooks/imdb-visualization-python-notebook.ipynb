As a part of this subtask, you need to aggregate a few values over these 3 columns. \n1. First create a new dataframe `df_by_genre` that contains `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` and all the columns related to **CVotes/Votes** from the `movies` data frame. There are 47 columns to be extracted in total.\n2. Now, Add a column called `cnt` to the dataframe `df_by_genre` and initialize it to one. You will realise the use of this column by the end of this subtask.\n3. First group the dataframe `df_by_genre` by `genre_1` and find the sum of all the numeric columns such as `cnt`, columns related to CVotes and Votes columns and store it in a dataframe `df_by_g1`.\n4. Perform the same operation for `genre_2` and `genre_3` and store it dataframes `df_by_g2` and `df_by_g3` respectively. \n5. Now that you have 3 dataframes performed by grouping over `genre_1`, `genre_2`, and `genre_3` separately, it's time to combine them. For this, add the three dataframes and store it in a new dataframe `df_add`, so that the corresponding values of Votes/CVotes get added for each genre.There is a function called `add()` in pandas which lets you do this. You can refer to this link to see how this function works. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.add.html\n6. The column `cnt` on aggregation has basically kept the track of the number of occurences of each genre.Subset the genres that have atleast 10 movies into a new dataframe `genre_top10` based on the `cnt` column value.\n7. Now, take the mean of all the numeric columns by dividing them with the column value `cnt` and store it back to the same dataframe. We will be using this dataframe for further analysis in this task unless it is explicitly mentioned to use the dataframe `movies`.\n8. Since the number of votes can't be a fraction, type cast all the CVotes related columns to integers.

Since we have the vote counts for both males and females, across various age groups, let's now see how the popularity of genres vary between the two genders in the dataframe. \n\n1. Make the first heatmap to see how the average number of votes of males is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for males, i.e., `CVotesU18M`,`CVotes1829M`, `CVotes3044M`, and `CVotes45AM`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-male group. \n\n2. Make the second heatmap to see how the average number of votes of females is varying across the genres. Use seaborn heatmap for this analysis. The X-axis should contain the four age-groups for females, i.e., `CVotesU18F`,`CVotes1829F`, `CVotes3044F`, and `CVotes45AF`. The Y-axis will have the genres and the annotation in the heatmap tell the average number of votes for that age-female group. \n\n3. Make sure that you plot these heatmaps side by side using `subplots` so that you can easily compare the two genders and derive insights.\n\n4. Write your any three inferences from this plot. You can make use of the previous bar plot also here for better insights.\nRefer to this link- https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html. You might have to plot something similar to the fifth chart in this page (You have to plot two such heatmaps side by side).\n\n5.

Let's analyse how both the US and the non-US voters have responded to the US and the non-US movies.\n\n1. Create a column `IFUS` in the dataframe `movies`. The column `IFUS` should contain the value \"USA\" if the `Country` of the movie is \"USA\". For all other countries other than the USA, `IFUS` should contain the value `non-USA`.\n\n\n2. Now make a boxplot that shows how the number of votes from the US people i.e. `CVotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Make use of the column `IFUS` to make this plot. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how non US voters have voted for the US and non-US movies by plotting `CVotesnUS` for both the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences/observations from these plots.\n\n\n3. Again do a similar analysis but with the ratings. Make a boxplot that shows how the ratings from the US people i.e. `VotesUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Similarly, make another subplot that shows how `VotesnUS` is varying for the US and non-US movies. Write any of your two inferences/observations from these plots.\n\nNote : Use `movies` dataframe for this subtask.

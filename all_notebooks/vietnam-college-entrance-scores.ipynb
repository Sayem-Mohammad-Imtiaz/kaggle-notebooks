Three years ago I couldn’t recall, except some basic maths and the alphabet, anything that I had learned so wholeheartedly for the exams in primary school.\"\n\n\"Because of the nature of adaptation and selection, we keep things that are important and useful. We throw away those that are not.\"\n\n\"However, that doesn’t mean we should try to memorize all the information or reduce the curriculum to fits our mind storage. Both of the solutions either convict or defend the laziness of human being – something rarely goes with mastery. If you truly learn something from any sort of education, which I humbly explain below, even if you think it has gone, it stays. On contrary, those words that were shuffled into our brain without any comprehension, even if we think they linger, they’ve died.\"\n\n\"Some people believe that the curriculum is too broad and superficial. I believe both of them are not inquiring the most important question, debating about “what to teach” instead of “how to teach.” The mission of education, in its truest virtue, is to arouse one’s curiosity and desires so that he/she can learn how to find the answer by himself/herself.\"\n\n\"At the core of education is the search for the balance between nature and nurture, where oneself while expanding his/her mind with the tools he/she has been given – books, the internet, and other resources – at the same time learn the matter of respect and contribution to his/her society. True learning is not what we have studied or memorized, but the acquisition of the skills that help us research, analyze information and express ourselves’s perspectives.\"\n\n\"The children need not the good grades, but the love for studying, care not the popular trend of college major, but love doing what they love, only that is when the country prospers. With this thesis, I identify three major issues that are facing Vietnam education system.\"\n\n\"Students have the right and should be encouraged to learn and read different sources of material on a given topic, rather than to be taught about a unilateral, fixed concept. However, this again creates another problem of how making books accessible to the majority of Vietnamese people.\"\n\n\"Most of the teachers nowadays, sadly, are incompetent to teach what demanded by the ever-changing world. Pedagogy needs much a revolution, or we will be doomed to obsolescence. It seems as if there is a veil that separates the teachers in a different era with those 21st-century-born students.\"\n\n\"Outdated science is religion. We’re now the witnesses of the dramatic development of technology, which grows exponentially doubling every ten years. Under such condition, as Henry Adams pointed out in his essay “A law of acceleration” (1906), “the teacher of 1900…. if foolish, might resist; if intelligent, might balance…. the forces would continue to educate, and the mind would continue to react. All the teacher could hope was to teach it reaction.” \n\n\"And reacting slower than the young minds, combining with some ego and frustration under the current mechanical education system, they can hardly catch up with it at all. It’s unbelievable to see that despite iPhone just released its iOS 10 a couple weeks ago and ranking showed Java being the most popular programming language in 2015, Vietnamese students are still learning Pascal from the 70s.\"\n\n\nTitle: On the Vietnamese education system – I’ve forgotten almost everything I learned \n\nKHANH NAM'S BLOG - Date: November 3, 2016 - Author: khanhnambui\n\nhttps://khanhnambui.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/ive-forgotten-almost-everything-ive-learned-on-vietnam-education-system/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('../input/college-entrance-exam-scores-in-vietnam-2019/diemthi2019.csv')\ndf1.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'red',\n                                     'color': '#FFD700'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-16T01:12:27.548619Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-16T01:12:27.548991Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-16T01:12:28.954421Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-16T01:12:27.54896Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-16T01:12:28.953327Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/college-entrance-exam-scores-in-vietnam-2019/diemthi2019_update.csv')\ndf.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'red',\n                                     'color': '#FFD700'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-16T01:12:38.875342Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-16T01:12:38.875923Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-16T01:12:39.988453Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-16T01:12:38.875887Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-16T01:12:39.987628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:red;border-radius:100px 100px;

From top to bottom, we show the number of tweets for each airline and sentiment, the number of retweets for each airline and sentiment, and the ratio of retweets to tweets for each airline and sentiment.  Sentiment is colored red, blue, or green to respectively represent negative, neutral, or positive sentiment.  Twitter users love to hate all of the airlines except Virgin America.  United is clearly the most reviled of all airlines.  Interestingly, the retweet efficiency is airline dependent.  Tweets about United, American, and US Airways are more likely to be retweeted if they are negative, while tweets about Southwest, Delta, and Virgin America are more likely to be retweeted if they are positive.  This general trend anecdotally reflects this author's personal opinion of airline quality. We speculate that Twitter users are retweeting comments that they personally agree with.  Consequently, we suggest that the retweet efficiency could be a useful metric for determining public opinion."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"groups = tweets.groupby([tweets.airline, \n                         tweets.airline_sentiment])\n\nretweet_table = groups.retweet_count.apply(sum)\nmy_colors = list(islice(cycle(['r', 'b', 'g']), \n                        None, len(retweet_table)))\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(3, sharex = True)\ngroups.count().name.plot(kind = 'bar', color = \n                         my_colors, title = \n                         '# of Tweets', ax = ax[0])\n\nretweet_table.plot(kind = 'bar', color= my_colors, \n                   title = '# of Retweets', ax = ax[1])\n(retweet_table/groups.count().name).plot(\n    kind = 'bar', color = my_colors, \n    title = 'Retweet Efficiency', ax = ax[2])"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages\n# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nlibrary(ggplot2) # Data visualization\nlibrary(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nsystem(\"ls ../input\")\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Julia environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/julia docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-julia\n# For example, here's a helpful package to load in \n\nusing DataFrames # data processing, CSV file I/O - e.g. readtable(\"../input/MyTable.csv\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nrun(`ls ../input`)\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

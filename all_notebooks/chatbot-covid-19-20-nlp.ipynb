Both in respect of career and in respect of mental health. Is there a treatment for the Coronavirus They are experimenting with various medicines and it seems some anti-malarial drugs show promise. However, they help only a little bit, as evidenced by the mortality rate in places like Italy or Spain. They are best if administered early, before the lungs are damaged. Is there a vaccine for the coronavirus We don’t “find” vaccines. That’s the language yellow media uses, but it’s far from the truth.\nWe know the virus, and we know what it looks like. Now we need to produce a sufficient amount of attenuated virii. For that, we inject the virus into a foreign host, like a chicken embryo in an egg. Most viruses will die, because the host is so different from humans, that it can not work. Some will mutate to work, and those multiply.How did coronaviruses get their name The coronavirus family was discovered first in 1960s but we don’t know where they come from. They get the name given their crown-like (“corona”) shape. Following a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified a new type called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).What are coronaviruses Coronavirus is a name for a group of viruses that target mammals, including cats, dogs, and humans. They’re well known for causing potentially fatal conditions like kidney failure, pneumonia but also mundane things like some instances of the common cold.\nDoes coronavirus cause death Statistically speaking, you have a 98% chance of survival, and 80% chance that you won’t need medical care at all even if you get infected, so stay positive, stay at home as much as possible, eat healthy, treat everyone as if they are infected, treat other as if you are infected. Many people get infected and get better without even knowing they had it.What can one do to prepare for the coronavirus? What should one buy or do regularly So, one thing you might do before it hits your region is to buy enough food for your freezer as well as canned goods and stock it so that, when the Virus hits, you won’t be running out into a store crowded with infected people. When it hits, stay home for work and school and strictly avoid crowded places. Stock up on real bar soap (like Ivory Gold) and wash hands frequently. Avoid sanitizers. Try to avoid clinics or EDs unless your symptoms become an issue as you don’t want to spread the disease beyond your home. Stock up on jello, G-Zero, plain decongestants like Mucinex, Bouillon or clear soups, lots of Kleenex and avoid solids and dairy products while you are symptomatic. The rest is just common sense.What should I buy to prepare for a coronavirus epidemic if I had to stay in my home for a very long time So, one thing you might do before it hits your region is to buy enough food for your freezer as well as canned goods and stock it so that, when the Virus hits, you won’t be running out into a store crowded with infected people.

The bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:\n\n* A vocabulary of known words.\n\n* A measure of the presence of known words.\n\nWhy is it is called a “bag” of words? That is because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded and the model is only **concerned with whether the known words occur in the document, not where they occur in the document.**\n\nThe intuition behind the Bag of Words is that documents are similar if they have similar content. Also, we can learn something about the meaning of the document from its content alone.\n\nFor example, if our dictionary contains the words {Learning, is, the, not, great}, and we want to vectorize the text “Learning is great”, we would have the following vector: (1, 1, 0, 0, 1).\n\n\n### TF-IDF Approach\nA problem with the Bag of Words approach is that highly frequent words start to dominate in the document (e.g. larger score), but may not contain as much “informational content”. Also, it will give more weight to longer documents than shorter documents.\n\nOne approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all documents so that the scores for frequent words like “the” that are also frequent across all documents are penalized. This approach to scoring is called Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, or TF-IDF for short, where:\n\n**Term Frequency: is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document.**\n\n```\nTF = (Number of times term t appears in a document)/(Number of terms in the document)\n```\n\n**Inverse Document Frequency: is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents.**\n\n```\nIDF = 1+log(N/n), where, N is the number of documents and n is the number of documents a term t has appeared in.\n```\n### Cosine Similarity\n\nTf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus\n\n```\nCosine Similarity (d1, d2) =  Dot product(d1, d2) / ||d1|| * ||d2||\n```\nwhere d1,d2 are two non zero vectors.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To generate a response from our bot for input questions, the concept of document similarity will be used.

However, there are some cases that not all of the employees that participated in the training session that will really proceed for the employment and might look for new employment in other companies. Therefore, to make the company's capital more effective and efficient (especially in the human resources), knowing which new signed up employees that want to work for the company could reduce the cost and time, as well as the quality of planning of the training courses and categorization of the candidates.\n\n## Objectives\n\n1.

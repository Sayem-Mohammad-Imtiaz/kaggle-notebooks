If you're not convinced just search \"stack overflow rude\".\n\nBut why are they? Stack overflow is an amazingly useful tool and the fact that random members of the internet will take large amounts of time to answer 1000s of questions with in depth answers is still amazing. However, as always with the internet, a small minority of people can ruin it for everyone else!\n\nBut why is this the case? Are there any patterns as to why? For example, are people more rude at certain times of the day? Could these patterns be then used to help advise people about how to post better questions and answers? Does this have any impact on how well received the answer is? Are nicer answers more often accepted?\n\nThese may seem like ambitious aims but in this meetup we will look at a few tools that can help you begin to tackle this question and bring together a range of useful generalist skills that should help any data scientist. \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. Getting data from BigQuery\n\nFirst we need to get our data for our investigation. [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) by Google is a data warehouse that can be very useful for larger projects. They also maintain a number of public database collections that make for excellent data sets to test your data science skills on. \n\nIn today's problem we are going to be looking at the Stack Overflow database. BigQuery has very usefully maintained a database of questions and answers and other metadata from Stack Overflow. A description of this database can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-bigquery-public-datasets-now-include-stack-overflow-q-a) and is very worth a read through as it describes the data fully. \n\n---\n\nThere are a few ways that we can do about downloading data from BigQuery. \n\n#### 1. Go to BigQuery directly and create our SQL request and download the dataset manually\n\nIf you head to [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and register for a Google Cloud account you can query the databases directly from their Google Cloud Platform. This approach can be very useful if you don't know what data it is you want and you want to have an interactive dashboard from which you can view the structure of each database hosted within BigQuery. This is where I went first to work out which tables within the Stack Overflow BigQuery database we needed for this meetup. \n\nFor example, below you can see an overview of what this interface looks like:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/central-ldn-data-sci/stack_overflow/master/images/Screenshot%20from%202019-05-26%2016-20-44.png)\n\n#### 2. Query BigQuery directly using python\n\nThe second option is to use the `BigQuery` namespace provided by the `google.cloud` package. This is what we will demonstrate in this meetup. \n\nFor some guidance on how to fill in the next section of code have a look at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/48573).\n\n---\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from google.cloud import bigquery\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef stack_user_answers(x):\n    '''Returns a data frame of Stack Overflow answers for requested user IDs\n    Args:\n    * x - (list) List of user ids as strings to be queried\n     \n    Return\n    * (pd.DataFrame) - DataFrame of Stack Overflow answers\n    '''\n\n    # create our bigquery client\n    client = bigquery.Client()\n\n    # create our SQL string query with our user ids\n    query = \"\"\"\n    SELECT\n      id, owner_display_name, body, creation_date, owner_user_id, score, tags\n    FROM\n      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers`\n    WHERE \n      owner_user_id IN (\"\"\" + None + \"\"\")\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # make our query using the client\n    query_job = client.query(None)\n\n    # iterate through the result\n    iterator = query_job.result()\n    rows = list(iterator)\n\n    # Transform the rows into a nice pandas dataframe\n    data = pd.DataFrame(data=[list(x.values()) for x in rows], columns=list(rows[0].keys()))\n    \n    return(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

These individuals are likely to have the most amount of data on (i.e. answers) over the longest period of time so these seem like a good starting point. \n\nTo collect these individuals we will need to write a little function to scrape these user's IDs from the Stack Overflow website. \n\nWe have looked at scraping information from web pages in a previous meetup - [Web Scraping and NLP](https://github.com/central-ldn-data-sci/web-scraping-and-nlp-CLDSPN).

The [documentation](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#about-the-scoring) can explain further what the values returned mean:\n\n* The pos, neu, and neg scores are ratios for proportions of text that fall in each category (so these should all add up to be 1... or close to it with float operation). These are the most useful metrics if you want multidimensional measures of sentiment for a given sentence.\n\n* The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).

Take Home Challenges\n\nWe explored a lot of things here, but we really only touched the surface of a lot of topics. So have a go at answering these open ended questions/suggestions of what analysis could be done next. \n\n### 1. Stack Overflow User Reputation and Badges\n\nWay back at the top of the meetup, we scraped the user IDs of the top users for the `r` and `python` tags from Stack Overflow. However, we could have grabbed more information! Go back and write a new scraping function to grab their reputation and the number of badges they have! Maybe these will be useful features in further analysis. \n\n### 2. Don't scrape - use BigQeury\n\nOR... you could use knowledge of the user IDs to query BigQuery for this information. Or use the Stack Overflow API. Have a go at getting this data this way.\n\n### 3. Top 10 revisited\n\nSo far we mostly used the sentiment analysis as features for looking at trends overall for the top 10 users. But, we could have changed the approach and modelled the user as a fixed effect to statistically test for whether each user has become more/less positive over time. Look back at some of the earlier material in the [Mixed Effects Meetup](https://www.kaggle.com/ojwatson/mixed-models) and build a linear model with the user treated as a fixed effect. Are there any user's who statistically get more or less positive over time?\n\n### 4. More features plz.\n\nSentiment analysis was great at reviewing the answers given by the user's as a whole. However, we could have taken it one step further and assessed the text for specific words associated with accepted answers. Does it just take a few nice words to make your answer more likely to be accepted? Have a look back at Zack's [NLP Meetup Notebook](https://github.com/central-ldn-data-sci/web-scraping-and-nlp-CLDSPN/blob/master/%5BCOMPLETED%5D%20Web%20Scraping%20and%20NLP.ipynb) to see how we can get the sentiment for each word and then use that to predict which words are more often associated with accepted answers.\n\n### 5. Scores on the doors\n\nLastly, our original extracte dataset from BigQuery also included a score column. This is the actual score of the answer as voted by user's for its usefulness etc. This surely must be linked to whether an answer is accepted. Have a go at bringing this into the random forest and see how this helps. Is there a threshold though for answers to usually be accepted?\n\n### 6. Does being positve actually make an accepted answer\n\nAt the end of section 7 above, we wrote:\n\n> Above we have demonstrated that the Compound score is an important feature in the trained random forest for predicting whether an aswer is accepted or not. We don't know what the branches in the fitted random forest are doing. For example, the fitted random forest may allocate increased probability of an answer being excepted if the compound score is very negative. All we show with the feature importance scores is whether they are useful features for the prediction. If you wanna go a bit further then have a look in the extension material.  \n\nHow could we acknowledge this fact and work out if positve answers are accepted more often. We could, for example, use the compound score to annotate our data set more and assign each answer as a positive, neutral or negative answer with one host encoding. We could then maybe compare the accepted proportions between positive and negative answers. And to acknowledge differences between users we could still use a mixed-effect framework for this.

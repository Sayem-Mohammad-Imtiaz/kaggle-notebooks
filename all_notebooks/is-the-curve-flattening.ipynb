Since the infection of the virus spreads through human contact, the growth of cummulative cases over time is expected to be exponential. As the number cases increase, the potential number of new infections come down as the virus can only infect a certain number of people, the worst case of which is the entire population being infected. So after a certain point the curve of infections would plateau. Correspondingly if we take a look at the trend of daily new cases, the graph would increase upto a point before starting to dip, emulating a bell shaped curve. The peak point of the bell curve corresponds to the starting point of the plateau of the cummulative curve. If the cummulative curve reachs it's plateau very rapidly, then the bell curve would reach a larger peaker which inturn would mean that a large number of people would be under treatment at that point in time, which would strain our health systems beyond it's capacity. This could have devestating effects on the death rate during this epidemic. So to improve our chances of surviving this pandemic without a huge loss, we need to flatten the bell curve, that is bring down it's peak by widening it. The government has declared a lockout in the country with the objective of reducing human contact and thus flatten the curve. The entire country is under lockdown for close to 8 weeks now and it is time ask the question, have we achieved what it was meant to achieve, flatten the curve?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport keras\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nimport math\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Read data and clean-up.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"India_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/covid19-in-india/covid_19_india.csv',parse_dates=['Date'], dayfirst=True)\nIndia_data.drop(['Sno'], axis=1, inplace=True)\nIndia_data.rename(columns={\"State/UnionTerritory\": \"States\"}, inplace=True)\nIndia_data['Active Cases'] = India_data['Confirmed'] - India_data['Cured'] - India_data['Deaths']\nIndia_daily= India_data.groupby(['Date'])['Active Cases'].sum().reset_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cases = India_data.groupby(['Date'])['Confirmed'].sum().values\ndaily = [cases[i] - cases[i-1] for i in range(1,cases.shape[0])]\nplt.plot(cases)\nplt.xlabel('No. of days')\nplt.ylabel('No. of confirmed cases')\nplt.title('Cummulative number of Corvid-19 cases in India')\nfig = plt.gcf()\nfig.set_size_inches(20, 10.5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Above is the plot of cummulative cases since 31st Jan 2020.

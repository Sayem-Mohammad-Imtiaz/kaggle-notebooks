For details, please see [The Three-Headed Dragon: Electricity, Trading, Analysis](https://www.mbureau.energy/articles/three-headed-dragon-electricity-trading-analysis-first-head-electricity).\n\nThe significant turnover share of the Electricity Wholesale Market of Russia comes from the so-called day-ahead market. In 2018, the day-ahead market made up 75% of the turnover. On the day-ahead market, a consumer buys its electricity consumption plan for the following day. Note, the plans are being traded. Later, when actual consumption values are received from measurement systems, the consumer buys or sells deviation between the day-ahead plan and actual volume. In Russia, this deviation market is called the balancing market; it made up 5% of turnover in 2018.\n\nLet’s have a look at consumer deals. Assume the consumer planned to consume 100 MWh between 0:00 and 1:00. This is a forecast. In reality, it consumes 99 MWh, which is slightly less than the plan. The consumer will buy 99 MWh the following way:\n* First, buy 100 MWh on the day-ahead market by day-ahead price.\n* Second, sell 1 MWh on the balancing market by a **minimum of two prices**: day-ahead price and balance market price.\n\nIn a different reality, when the consumer consumes more than plan, for example 101 MWh, the deals look the following way:\n* First, buy 100 MWh on the day-ahead market by day-ahead price.\n* Second, buy 1 MWh on the balancing market by a **maximum of two prices**: day-ahead price and balance market price.\n\nAs you can see, the pricing mechanism for deviations is organized in a way to push the consumer to plan as accurately as possible: the higher the consumption deviation, the higher total cost of electricity and vice versa.\n\nThe positive side of the electricity market is that we can easily calculate the reduction of electricity cost, which comes from the improvement of the short-term consumption forecast accuracy by 1 MWh within the year. This is what I call **«benefit from improving»**.\n\n**Assess the benefit from improving**\n\nInput data are the day-ahead and balancing market prices. In my dataset, I upload the prices for the so-called United Energy System. The United Energy System is a large area (remember Russia is vast itself), the whole country comprises seven systems. The prices are available for three: UES_Northwest, UES_Siberia, UES_Center.\n\nNote that balancing market price is called an indicator because it’s an auxiliary variable to define the deal price.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport random as random\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"timestep_name = 'timestep'\n\n# United Energy System we're going to consider (could be UES_Northwest, UES_Siberia, UES_Center)\nues = 'UES_Northwest'\n\n# How we're going to aggreate accuracy cost, this is for yearly value\nagg_pattern = '%Y'\n\n# How many random scenarios of deviation we're going through\nnumber_of_scenarios = 100\nrub_eur_exchange = 70.8                 # I took an average exchange rate for 2017-2019, rub/euro","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Upload the data and make sure we analyze the same time frame."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"price = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/russian-wholesale-electricity-market/RU_Electricity_Market_UES_dayahead_price.csv')\nprice.index = price[timestep_name]\nprice.drop(timestep_name, axis=1, inplace=True)\n\nindicator = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/russian-wholesale-electricity-market/RU_Electricity_Market_UES_intraday_price.csv')\nindicator.index = indicator[timestep_name]\nindicator.drop(timestep_name, axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n# Make sure we're considering the same time range\nif len(indicator) < len(price):\n    dates_range = indicator.index\nelse:\n    dates_range = price.index\n\nprice = price.loc[dates_range]\nindicator = indicator.loc[dates_range]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's pretend our consumer consumes 100 MWh every sigle hour\nactuals = np.ones(len(price)) * 100\n\n# Variable to write result\naccuracy_benefit_agg = dict()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Function to create a fiction forecast and improve it by 1 MWh."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_forecast(act):\n\n    # Create forecast as random deviation from actuals\n    f_1 = act + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=10, size=(len(act)))\n    f_2 = f_1.copy()\n\n    # Define hours when consumer buys or sells deviation higher then 1 MWh\n    buy = (f_1 -

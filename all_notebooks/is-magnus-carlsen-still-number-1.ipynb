He tended to win most of the tournaments he entered and his rating was well beyond any other player. His rise to the top was unabated until after he became the world champion. His first match with Anand was seen as a mere formality. Carlsen won 3 games and lost none. Just a year later Carlsen defended his title against Anand in what was regarded as a closer match. Carlsen lost a game to the former world champion this time, but he still managed to win. Most recently Carlsen defended his title against Sergey Karjakin in late 2016. Karjakin is a top grandmaster for sure, but at the time of the match he was rated only 9th in the world. Karjakin managed to score the first win in this match and came close to accomplishing the upset. Carlsen was only able to hold on to his title by leveling the match in round 10 and then winning in tie breaks.\n\nCarlsen has been the world's top rated chess player for many years now, but his rating as declined quite a bit from it's peak.  For over a year now Carlsen hasn't won a tournament. Just how far has Carlsen fallen? How close are his challengers? This is the question I set out to answer with this dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data cleaning & preparation","metadata":{}},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f9cbce1b636c9a95badf2c15ffc53cdaabc8c69b","_cell_guid":"3d8c18cb-e99e-4c69-b0ca-60115830e48c","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd","execution_count":1},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a9861d46cbba059ddfcec6262dfd50aab0b8a32d","_cell_guid":"1337c0ee-b6b2-47f8-9aa0-5bc230b3e8ea","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/fide_historical.csv')","execution_count":2},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d02379e94daf0078cf2133fc809d5974d91239c7","_cell_guid":"d3ddb7a0-5ecd-49c2-ada1-0e9273cd7ab8"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df.head()","execution_count":3},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3945b35486c93541f88dcba7d0c28e3ac798c094","_cell_guid":"e308a546-33e7-4689-a8f5-73c77a5dca62"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df.info()","execution_count":4},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1d6d8a8cdb9737c6352b3c957eae1a5fdb11dfca","_cell_guid":"531b8cd3-645f-41d6-8bd7-4b546d48aa7b","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ranking_date'])","execution_count":5},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c879db410d3c5fbec2028cccd569177164c54110","_cell_guid":"8e507e79-0332-4b45-bd86-518742b0c433"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df[df['name'] == 'Carlsen, Magnus'].head()","execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Individual Player Ratings Chart","metadata":{"_uuid":"52c82e63820ed08767505625d9726e4505a0a696","_cell_guid":"91758d3d-2306-4822-932f-4790272bc252"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Magnus Carlsen's peak rating was published on May 27, 2014","metadata":{}},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"df.loc[df.loc[df['name'] == 'Carlsen, Magnus', ['rating']].idxmax()]","execution_count":20},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c7a6bc3c6f530bfc36f4071067e81ca33dd0bd70","_cell_guid":"ddee96d1-3fe0-4d88-bed5-fb2d9fb60f1d","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"plt = df[df['name'] == 'Carlsen, Magnus'].plot(x='date', y='rating',\n                                              title='Magnus Carlsen\\'s Rating Progress',\n                                              figsize=(8,5),\n                                              legend=False)","execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Wesley So was the second highest rated player most recently.

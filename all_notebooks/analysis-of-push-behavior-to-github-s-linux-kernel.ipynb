The typical belief is that developers should make many small commits, rather than the occasionally massive batch.  However, all though this is what programmers should be doing on projects, like many things, what ought to be is not necessarily the nature of things.  By analyzing open source project push events, we can get an idea of how commits are truly done."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bfb52730-44b6-e466-e43b-b6b862c40c57"},"outputs":[],"source":"import matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport networkx as nx\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom __future__ import division"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"65681ba8-25e6-73d5-b1a1-37c30c1ac97f"},"outputs":[],"source":"pd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.3f' % x) #Remove scientific notation for df.describe()\ncommits_df = pd.read_csv('../input/LinuxCommitData.csv',\n                         header=0,\n                         index_col=None,\n                         na_values='',\n                         parse_dates=['Date'],\n                         usecols=range(0,5),\n                         names=['Date', 'Commits', 'Additions', 'Deletions', 'UserID'])"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"90af3e54-0900-fe07-a396-db945ffaba2e"},"source":"## Contributing to the Linux Kernel\nThis data set contains commits to the Linux kernel project on GitHub from April 7th, 2002 - March 3rd, 2017, spread out over 636 individual days.

This is a far cry from the approx. 9.8 million lines that were added over time.

The median number of commits is 1,061 with 75 of the users being within 600 commits.  The smallest number of total commits by a particular user is 845.75.  The visualization clearly indicates how it is skewed to the right with a few users having a large number of commits.  At the most, a single user made 4,903 commits, but this may simply indicate the occurrence of a `merge`.

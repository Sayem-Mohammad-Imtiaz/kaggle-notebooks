Some key features should be taken into consideration.i.e The sex, month, race,age, place, education.\n-It was also seen that the months with the highest cases of gun death were the months of July, August and September while the month with the lowest death case is February.\n-A plunge in death cases occurred during the year 2014 after a previous sharp rise. Guess maybe the government has put in some checks in order to reduce death cases in subsequent years.\n-More Male were involved compared to Female. \n\nThanks."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

Used to find the magnitude/strength of the correlation between variables.\n2. More accurate than that of scatter plot.\n\n***Why is it better than scatter plot?***\n\n1. Scatter plots are difficult to interpret.\n2. If there is a lot of data, there is a higher probability of more than one scatter overlapping each other.\n3. This makes the scatter plot difficult to plot as well for we would have to take care of its shortcomings, while on the other hand finding the correlation using a short and efficient algorithm is quite easy\n\n***Why use Pearson's correlation?***\n\n1. Because the relation between all of the variables is linear and Pearson's correlation works well with linear correlations.\n2.

{"nbformat_minor":2,"nbformat":4,"cells":[{"source":"# Generate a Shake-up Scatter Plot for each Kaggle Competition\n\nThis notebook generates a plot of public LB rank vs private LB rank for all teams in a competition, for each Kaggle competition.\n\nEach competition's plot is saved as an image file, and all are zipped into one output for easy download (see output files section).\n\nHighly scattered plots are harder to compress and result in larger image files - so this is another way to rank competitions by shake-up (number of teams is mixed in to this metric too - more teams = more data points, so larger competitions at the top).\n\n**New**: you can try different image codecs. By default (lossless) PNG is used but JPEG would work and create a different ranking.\n\nA preview of the top 40 largest plots are shown below.\n\n\n## Contents\n\n * [Generate Plots](#Generate-Plots)\n * [Correlations to Competition Features](#Correlations-to-Competition-Features)\n * [Compare All Competitions](#Compare-All-Competitions)\n * [Competitions: Top 40 Highest Shake-up](#Competitions:-Top-40-Highest-Shake-up)\n * [Competitions: Most Recent](#Competitions:-Most-Recent)\n * [Inspect One Competition](#Inspect-One-Competition)\n * [Related Links and Info](#Related-Links-and-Info)\n\n## Background\n\nWhy do this?\n\nThe plots are *rank* vs *rank* - so every team in a competition has their own \"address\" in the plot, there is no complete overlap of any two points.\n\nHowever, teams that move from neighbouring positions on the public LB, to neighbouring positions on the *private* LB, have points *together* in the plot.\n\nImage compression uses correlations of *neighbouring* pixels to reduce the amount of data required to store an image.\n\nFor example [PNG][1] uses a 2-stage compression process:\n\n - pre-compression: filtering (prediction)\n - compression: DEFLATE\n\nIn the filtering process, each pixel is *predicted* &mdash; it can use as input: the pixel to the left, the pixel above, or the pixel above and to the left, or a combination.\n\nIf there was zero shake-up the teams would form a diagonal line and the image would be easy to compress, lots of blank background space and a thin line of highly predictable points for the teams.\n\nWith high shake-up teams move around a lot and each pixel is harder to predict based on it's neighbours.\n\n(Another way to think of it is edges: every transition from background to scatter-plot marker is an *edge* and it is really the *edges* that are costly in compression. An edge is high frequency information, a space without edges is low frequency.)\n\nUsing file size as a ranking system is not perfect, for example long competition titles add a bit to the file size, and it's sensitive to the size of the markers. But it's quick to implement, it tells us *something* about competitions, and the resulting plots can reveal insights too :)\n\nA similar idea, *compression distance*, can be highly useful in ML competitions, e.g. $A$, $B$ are typically strings and $A+B$ is string concatenation:\n\n$$CompressionDistance = \\frac{|compress(A+B)|}{|compress(A)|+|compress(B)|}$$\n\nIf a compressed representation of $A+B$ is much smaller than the combination when they are when compressed separately, there is redundancy between $A$ and $B$.\n\nMore generally, from the [Data Compression][2] article on Wikipedia:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere is a close connection between machine learning and compression.\nA system that predicts the posterior probabilities of a sequence given\nits entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by using\narithmetic coding on the output distribution). An optimal compressor\ncan be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses\nbest, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a\njustification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general\nintelligence\".\n</blockquote>\n\n<!--\n    Portable Network Graphics (PNG, officially pronounced /pɪŋ/[2][3] PING, more commonly pronounced /ˌpiːɛnˈdʒiː/[4] PEE-en-JEE) is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.

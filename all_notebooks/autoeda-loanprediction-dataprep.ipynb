in the dataset using the plot dataframe.\n* Details about each variables / features in the dataset by using create_report - overview, variables, interactions, correlations, missing values\n* Interactions - based on x-axis and y-axis scatter plots\n* Correlations between variables - Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, Kendall's Rank Correlation Coefficient\n* Missing Values - Bar chart, Spectrum, Heatmap, Dendogram representations\n* We can pick one particular feature and analyze - Stats, Bar chart, Pie chart, Word Count, Word Frequency etc as per applicability\n\n\n### When To Use?\n\n* Dataset size is fairly very large (this seems to be 10X faster than Pandas Profiling tools due to it's highly optimized Dask-based computing module)\n*

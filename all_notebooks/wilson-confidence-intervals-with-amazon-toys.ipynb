In this notebook I will cover an implementation of a much more complicated estimator, the Wilson CI.\n\nThe Wilson CI is obnoxiously complicated:\n\n![](https://www.evanmiller.org/images/average-rating/equation.png)\n\nMathematically, all of this jazz is basically just a correction for certain incorrect assumptions injected by the simple Wald test. These changes paticularly make a difference when the number of samples are small, resulting an overall more accurate result. However, the derivation is complex.\n\nA good reference on the difference between the Wald and Wilson CIs is [this paper](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/staff/sean/resources/binomialpoisson.pdf). In practical data science, you will almost always be fine with just using the Wald test.\n\nHowever, the Wilson confidence interval has an interesting application, one most popularly described [here](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html). It turns out that the Wilson CI (in particular, its lower bound) is the ideal formulation of the confidence interval to use for ranking items based on their review scores. It compensates for the \"small number of elements\" problem: e.g. the fact it's quite likely for a bad product with few reviews to have only good reviews simply by statistical chance.\n\nFor this reason the \"percentage good reviews\" isn't statistically meaningful. In the past, I've gotten around this problem by mandating that the items being reviewed have at least X reviews, where X is an abritrary threshold on how much statistical noise I accept having, versus how many records I get to use for the algorithm. This is the approach I used in e.g. [Recommending Chess Openings](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/recommending-chess-openings/notebook).\n\nThis is a problem for a lot of websites as well, as it is essentially the problem to the question \"how do you go about ranking items in a search result?\". The Wilson Confidence Interval is a better way of approaching this problem than simpler but more noisy alternative approaches, like taking `Upvotes - Downvotes` or `Upvotes / All Votes`.\n\nIn this notebook I apply the Wilson CI to reviews of Amazon toy products. I am *not* doing the Wilson CI derivation, that's worth a whole other notebook...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data munging","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"import pandas as pd\ntoys = pd.read_csv(\"../input/amazon_co-ecommerce_sample.csv\")\ntoys.head()","metadata":{},"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"import numpy as np\n\ndef get_scores(l):\n    try:\n        if pd.isnull(l):\n            return np.array([])\n    except:\n        ret = np.array(l)[1::4]\n        ret = [str(s).strip() for s in ret]\n        try:\n            ret = [float(s) for s in ret]\n        except ValueError:\n            ret = []\n            \n        return ret\n    \nreview_scores = toys.customer_reviews.str.split(\"//\").map(get_scores).values","metadata":{},"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"source":"review_scores[:5].tolist()","metadata":{},"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notice that to apply the Wilson confidence interval we need to simplify this five-star rating system down to a \"positive reviews\" versus \"negative reviews\" one.

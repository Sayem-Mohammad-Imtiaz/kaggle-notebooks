You can see that in image below:\n\n![Growth Rings](https://www.marinebio.net/marinescience/06future/abimg/ab3686.jpg)\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] UCI Machine Learning Repository: Abalone Data Set. \n    http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone\n\n\nNOTE: This is a problem about Abalone...but not really.

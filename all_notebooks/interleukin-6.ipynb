By Zulvikar Syambani Ulhaqa,1, and Gita Vita Soraya\nMed Mal Infect. 2020 Apr 4 - doi: 10.1016/j.medmal.2020.04.002 \n\nPrevious retrospective studies indicated that an elevated level of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was associated with a high case fatality of COVID-19 infection. Thus, a meta-analysis of the current scientific literature was performed to investigate whether the measurement of serum IL-6 may predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients.\n\n Hedge's standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the IL-6 level in non-severe and severe patients. Heterogeneity was evaluated with Q-test and I2 statistics. Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test were applied to determine publication bias if the pooled effect size consisted of 10 or more studies. A sensitivity test was performed by sequentially omitting one study each time to evaluate the stability of the results. Data that was not expressed as mean and standard deviation was extrapolated from the sample size, median, and interquartile range (IQR). The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.3 and the value of 0.05 was indicative of statistical significance.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129451/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsinterleukincsv/interleukin.csv', sep=';')\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" Although the heterogeneity was considerably high (I2  = 89%; P  < 0.00001), they observed that IL-6 levels were significantly increased in COVID-19-infected patients with severe condition compared with those with non-severe condition (SMD = 0.71, 95%CI −0.31–1.12, P  = 0.0005).

Among them, IL-6 is of major importance because of its pleiotropic effects. The authors presented the evidence that circulating IL-6 levels are closely linked to the severity of COVID-19 infection. An increase in IL-6 levels has previously been observed in patients with respiratory dysfunction, implying a possible shared mechanism of cytokine-mediated lung damage caused by COVID-9 infection. Furthermore, it seems that the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 is associated with rapid virus replication and a tendency to infect the lower respiratory tract, resulting in an elevated response of IL-6-induced severe respiratory distress. Thus, their results suggest that serial measurement of circulating IL-6 levels may be important in identifying disease progression among COVID-19-infected patients. In line with Their findings, an elevated level of IL-6 has been proven to be a good biomarker for severity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Therefore, it is reasonable that immediate initial evaluation of IL-6 level be performed upon hospital admission of COVID-19 patients, due to its potential benefits to assess worsening clinical features and disease progression in COVID-19.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7129451/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['204252_at'].hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes from Taikutsu  https://www.kaggle.com/ravels1991/simple-eda/notebook#Plotting","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df.groupby('Samples')['204252_at'].max().sort_values(ascending=True).plot(kind='barh', figsize=(12,8),\n                                                                                   title='Maximum Interleukin-6 Samples')\nplt.xlabel('204252_at')\nplt.ylabel('Samples')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df.groupby('Samples')['204252_at'].mean().sort_values(ascending=True).plot(kind='barh', figsize=(12,8),\n                                                                                   title='Mean Interleukin-6 Samples')\nplt.xlabel('204252_at')\nplt.ylabel('Samples')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df.groupby('Samples')['204252_at'].min().sort_values(ascending=True).plot(kind='barh', figsize=(12,8), \n                                                                                  title='Minimum Interleukin-6 Samples')\nplt.xlabel('204252_at')\nplt.ylabel('Samples')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df.groupby('Samples')['211804_s_at', '211803_at'].sum().plot(kind='bar', rot=45, figsize=(12,6), logy=True,\n                                                                 title='211804_s_at x 211803_at')\nplt.xlabel('Samples')\nplt.ylabel('Log Scale 211804_s_at')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df.groupby('Samples')['211804_s_at', '211803_at'].sum().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(14,8),\n                                                                 title='211804_s_at x 211803_at', logx=True, linewidth=3)\nplt.xlabel('Log Scale 211804_s_at')\nplt.ylabel('Samples')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you Taikutsu for your codes and having worked in my Dataset Black Race people.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQNaOi7WLRM51M_Jg82Y5MIUpCPjmmt1Kavql8KQU7v4PonuNq9&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"twitter.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata   @mpwolke","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

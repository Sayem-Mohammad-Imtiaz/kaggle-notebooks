[Draw](https://www.chess.com/terms/draw-chess) is obviously not a win, and out of time result could end with a draw as the rules of the game states that if one player is out of time and the other player has insufficient material to checkmate the game ends with a draw.\n\n### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\n\n* There are **rated and unrated games**, but I decided to investigate those rated games as they are more competative than unrated ones, and they form the majority of data.

At first, the distribution was right skewed, so I applied **log scale** to take a good look at the right tail. Instead, the distribution shifted to the right and becomes left skewed. That is when I found **outliers at the left tail**; games with 1,2, and 3 turns only are odd in practice.

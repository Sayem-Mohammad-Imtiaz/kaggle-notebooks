It was when I did my first Kaggle competition I began to pay attention to it. Especially after seeing some code from different participants, I noticed some of them emphasize EDA in their method. At the time I realized that I practiced some points of EDA without me even noticed it. However, that was the time I started to pay attention to EDA seriously.\n\nThe main benefit that I feel when I started to incorporate EDA as a definite step into my data science project is that I become more organized and it becomes easier to understand what to do next. So, I am thinking to create a framework that will provide a clear guide on EDA (at least for me).\n\nThere is a lot of sources on EDA out there but the ones that I find helpful for me are Hands-On Exploratory Data Analysis with Python, a book by Suresh Kumar Mukhiya and Usman Ahmed. A video on YouTube also helps (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBRkLo568Q&list=PLqW0gOGkUieY3Ljs9S0TuFP36xqefLDcg&index=3&t=1420s).\n\n## What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?\n\nAccording to IBM, Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps to determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.\n\nFor me, EDA is all about understanding your data, check the connection of entities of the data, and find patterns. It is quite remarkable the insight we can get about our data by performing EDA. Create an EDA framework is like create a path, a clear pathway will get us to our destination faster and safer.\n\n\n## My EDA framework: IDENTIFICATION -> TRANSFORMATION -> VISUALIZATION AND EXPLORATION\n\n\n\n    \n## IDENTIFICATION\n\nWhen we are doing a data science project, we usually deal with a set of data, or what we call a data set. Data by Merriam-webster definition is a piece of factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. A data set usually consists of columns and rows. A column represents a variable, an entity that we want to investigate. Meanwhile, a row is the value of a certain variable. The feature is just another name for the variable.\n\nA complete explanation of types of data can be seen here: https://www.upgrad.com/blog/types-of-data/\n\n### Why Does Identification Matter?\n\nIdentification of type of data is extremely important. It will be easier for us to do further analysis if we know what kind of data we are dealing with. Statistical methods are designed to work with a certain type of data. Methods that are used in numerical data sometimes cannot be used for categorical types of data. Knowing our data type will limit the possibility of us using the wrong method of analysis.\n\nNominal data allow us to calculate frequencies, proportions, and percentages. They can be illustrated using a bar chart or pie chart. Meanwhile, for ordinal data, summarize calculation; frequencies, percentile, mode, median, and interquartile range are allowed to be evaluated. They also work well with bar and pie charts.\n\nIn continuous data, we have the most choice for summarization. Calculation of percentile, interquartile range, central tendencies (mean, median, and mode), and the standard deviation are possible. For visualization, continuous data are better represented by histogram or box plot.\n\n\n## TRANSFORMATION\n\nData transformation is a method to change the structure, format, and value of the data so that our data become more accessible for analysis. There is a lot of techniques for data transformation and there is no exact way to do so. First, we need to set what the objectives of our project are. Second, understand the procedures or steps to achieve those goals. Only by that, we will be able to identify the appropriate data transformation to apply in our data.\n\n\n## VISUALIZATION AND EXPLORATION\n\nWhen talking about visualization, it usually is about charts, variable description, and relationships between variables. It is important to be close to kinds of charts and understand when to use each of them. The book I mentioned above also gives a great explanation about types of charts, when to use them, and examples of how to use them using Python.\n\nIn the end, identification, transformation, and visualization and exploration are all about gaining insight into our data. They are not a separate process. You might be doing transformation and visualization at once, or doing it one by one. There is no absolute way to do EDA, everyone has their method. The result, however, can be surprising. Sometimes, we will find information we never think of before."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As always, first is to import libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load the dataset that will be used"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vehicles = pd.read_csv('../input/craigslist-carstrucks-data/vehicles.csv')\nvehicles.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# print shape and column names\nprint(vehicles.columns)\nprint(vehicles.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## IDENTIFICATION"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vehicles.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# check type of each variable\nvehicles.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since it now has 26 columns, it is hard to know whether we have desirable the type of data for each column or not.

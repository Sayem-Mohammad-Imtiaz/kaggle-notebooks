Included in pandas are DataFrames, which are class objects that represents data in tables. This data is often read in from one or more excel files.\n\nTo take a look at how to use a DataFrame in a practical way, we will ask and answer some questions about foreign exchange rates between the US and other countries. For the following examples, we will use datasets available in 2 csv files called \"Foreign_Exchange_Rates\" and \"currency_exchange_rate\".\n\nWe can import the datasets and save them as DataFrames named `rates` and `ex_rates`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rates = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/foreign-exchange-rates-per-dollar-20002019/Foreign_Exchange_Rates.csv')\nex_rates = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/currency-excahnge-rate/currency_exchange_rate.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Display\n\nNow that we have saved our DataFrames, we may want to preview them without loading the whole thing.

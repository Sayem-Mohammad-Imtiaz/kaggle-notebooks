This is my first notebook on Kaggle! Not quite sure if the Data Scientist path is the one for me, but we all have to start somewhere :) The inspiration behind this notebook is based on my two best friends past interest in studying human behaviors and especially those of serial killers. Special thanks to them for answering my prelude questions so that I can either disapprove or verify their assumptions in my deductions.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Questions:**\n\n 1. What is the race, sex and/or age range combination most likely to\n    commit 'Murder or Manslaughter'?\n 2. What is the race, sex and/or age range combination most likely to\n    commit 'Manslaughter by Negligence'?\n 3. Which states are homicide crimes highest in?\n 4. Which weapon would males most likely use to commit homicide?\n 5. Which weapon would females most likely use to commit homicide?\n 6. What years were homicide crimes the highest in?\n 7. What is the typical female victim's age?\n 8. What is the typical male victim's age?\n 9. The highest homicide crime count is between which two sexes?\n 10. Which ethnicity is most likely a victim of homicide?\n 11. Are we more likely to see homicide crimes between same or\n     different ethnicities?\n 12. Homicide crimes are highest during what months of the year?\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**The Ketchup Goddess (Bestie #1) Answers:**\n\n 1. White Males between late 20's-late 30's are more likely to commit 'Murder\n    or Manslaughter.'\n 2. White Males between teen-early 20's are more likely to commit\n    'Manslaughter by Negligence.'\n 3. The highest homicide crimes are located in the Pacific Northwest Regions (Serial\n    Killers specific.)\n 4. Weapon Males would typically use to commit homicide is Gun.\n 5. Weapon Females would typically use to commit homicide is Poison.\n 6. Years with the highest homicide crimes are during 1970s - 1980s because there were less law\n    enforcements during those eras. Since that era there are less chances of children wandering\n    around alone (amber alerts are now in place and etc.)\n 7. Typical Female Age victim is from teens to early 20's.\n 8. Typical Male Age victim is from mid to late 20's.\n 9. Homicide crimes most likely involves Male killing Female.\n 10. Most likely victim ethnicity is Hispanic.\n 11. Homicide crimes are more likely between individuals of the same ethnicity.\n 12. The highest homicide crime occurrences are during the months from Dec. - Feb. due to holidays.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Lieutenant Golden Chicken Nuggets and (Bestie #2) Answers:**\n\n 1. Males between 25-45 are more to commit 'Murder or Manslaughter.'\n 2. Males between 16-25 are more likely to commit 'Manslaughter by Negligence.'\n 3. The highest homicide crimes are located in California because it is directly south\n    of Pacific Northwest (Serial Killer specific area.)\n 4. Weapon Males would typically use to commit homicide is Gun.\n 5. Weapon Female would typically use to commit homicide is Knife.\n 6. Years with the highest homicide crimes are during 2007-2010 because of the Depression.\n 7. Typical Female Age victim is from 20-40.\n 8. Typical Male Age victim is from 30 - 40.\n 9. Homicide crimes most likely involves Male killing Female.\n 10. Most likely victim ethnicity is Not Hispanic.\n 11. Homicide crimes are more likely between individuals of the same ethnicity.\n 12. This highest homicide crime occurrences are during the months from Dec. - Feb. due to weather (snow to hide the body, dreary weather and people are depressed.)\n\n\n----------\n\n**Extra Speculations Bestie #2 wanted me to look into:**\n\n 1. The highest occurring homicide crime type is White Male kills White Female Wife and the Victim Count > 0, where the weapon is either a Handgun or Knife.\n 2. Pennsylvania's most used weapon in a homicide crime is a Handgun (Arizona\n    otherwise.)\n 3. Most likely victim race is Black.\n 4. Most likely to have a homicide crime between the same race."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"67439e2e-bebf-b3b1-a4d0-38e710a81981"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Libraries required for Data Analysis\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random as rnd\n\n#Libraries required for Data Visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Libraries required for Machine Learning\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8f3aa15e-e665-44c4-602e-a2bbe5419a29"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Load in the Dataset\ndataset = pd.read_csv(\"../input/database.csv\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7273275b-24ae-7595-d07d-481ffc5037d2"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Display features available in the Dataset\nprint(dataset.columns.values)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"16f36041-d3aa-37f5-1db6-219453003328"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Preview the Data (Beginning)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndataset.head()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a6cf60c1-5c3c-799c-2c3a-3573eb036e2e"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Preview the Data (Ending)\ndataset.tail()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dcaca5d4-6426-99ce-0761-6dd6dafd8c94"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Display Feature Types\ndataset.info()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9008a26-517f-33ef-8999-a637aaecd7eb"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Convert Categorical Features that should be numerics for analysis\ndataset['Perpetrator Age'] = pd.to_numeric(dataset['Perpetrator Age'], errors='coerce')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f6f11568-a708-f423-553f-70ad547074ff"},"outputs":[],"source":"#Review the distribution of the numerical features\ndataset.describe()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dbc42fbd-c4ab-b042-bee2-440137e642e6"},"source":"**Analysis of the Chart Above:**\n\n - Years of Homicide Crimes documentation is indeed between 1980 - 2014.\n - The average victim age was around 35 years old.\n - The average perpetrator age was around 20 years old.\n - There seems to be an error in the dataset where the oldest victim was 998 years old and the youngest was 0 years old (default missing value?)

the initial questions we set out to answer and their answers:**\n\nWhat is the race, sex and/or age range combination most likely to commit 'Murder or Manslaughter'? \n\n**Answer:** Black (15-35) Males and White (15-40) Males\n\nWhat is the race, sex and/or age range combination most likely to commit 'Manslaughter by Negligence'? \n\n**Answer:** White (10-35) Males and Black (15-20) Males\n\nWhich states are homicide crimes highest in? \n\n**Answer:** California (Murder or Manslaughter - Highest) and Florida (Manslaughter by Negligence)\n\nWhich weapon would males most likely use to commit homicide? \n\n**Answer:** Handgun\n\nWhich weapon would females most likely use to commit homicide? \n\n**Answer:** Handgun\n\nWhat years were homicide crimes the highest in? \n\n**Answer:** 1980-1981, 1990-1995\n\nWhat is the typical female victim's age? \n\n**Answer:** 0-5 years old\n\nWhat is the typical male victim's age? \n\n**Answer:** 0-5, 10-30 (Highest 15-20)\n\nThe highest homicide crime count is between which two sexes? \n\n**Answer:** Male and Male\n\nWhich ethnicity is most likely a victim of homicide? \n\n**Answer:** Not Hispanic (Excluding Unknown)\n\nAre we more likely to see homicide crimes between same or different ethnicities? \n\n**Answer:** Same ethnicities (Highest is Not Hispanic x Not Hispanic)\n\nHomicide crimes are highest during what months of the year? \n\n**Answer:** Most homicides occurred during July-August.\n\n\n----------\n\n**Special Speculations from Bestie #2:**\n\n The highest occurring homicide crime type is White Male kills White Female Wife and the Victim Count > 0, where the weapon is either a Handgun or Knife.\n\n**Answer:** False, homicide crimes are more likely to occur between males of the same race.\n\nPennsylvania's most used weapon in a homicide crime is a Handgun (Arizona\n    otherwise.)\n\n**Answer:** Handgun is the most used weapon in homicide crimes for both Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\nMost likely victim race is Black.\n\n**Answer:** White is slightly higher, but could be a tie with Black.\n\nMost likely to have a homicide crime between the same race.\n\n**Answer:** True, a homicide crime is more likely to occur between the same race. Highest occurrences of homicides are between Whites and a close second is between Blacks.\n\n----------\n\nAndddd that's all folks! I might add more to this as I report the results back to my friends, but this was a fun way to start off my potential journey as a data scientist.

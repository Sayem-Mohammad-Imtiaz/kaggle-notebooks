Patient Age and Axillary Nodes are the main deciding features for survival.\n2. Dataset is not balanced but complete as no value is missing.\n3. People with age range 40-60 have maximum chances of survival.\n4. Operation year 60 had highest survival rate.\n5. Operation year range 63-66 had lowest survival rate.\n6. Axillary node with range 0-1 has the highest survival rate.\n7. Patients between age range 30-34 survived after the treatment.\n8. Patients with age > 77 were not able to survive.\n9. Patients with age < 40 and axillary nodes < 30 have higher chances of survival.\n10. Patients with age > 50 and axillary nodes > 10 have lower chances of survival.\n11. Inter quartile range of Patient_age is 16.75 \n12. Inter quartile range of Operation_year is 5.75 \n13. Inter quartile range of Axillary_nodes is 4.0 \n14. Pairplots are linearly inseparable.\n15. Axillary_nodes feature has the most outliers.","metadata":{}}]}

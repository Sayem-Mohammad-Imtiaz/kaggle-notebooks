Moreover, when a subject is fun it's much more engaging and you can learn so much more, so why not use some Pokémon! During the 1990's, Pokémon became a world wide cultural phenomenon. Their popularity continues to this day across card games, movies, anime TV series, video games and mobile apps, including Pokémon Go, download an incredible 750 million times in it's first complete year. \n\nThis Notebook was designed to give myself a brief introduction to creating Kaggle Notebooks while also learning some more Pandas in Python. Here, I will utilise some of Panda's more common and useful functions, while traversing the *initial* stages of a typical data science process. In this tutorial, we will concentrate on *data preparation*, *data cleansing* and some *exploratory data analysis*. In future, we might want to also look at the remaining stages of *data analysis* and *communicating* our findings through *visualisation*\n\nMuch of this tutorial was based around the excellent [10 Minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) tutorial and I was inspired by I, Coder's fantastic article [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/learn-pandas-with-pokemons/notebook) \n\n***By Grant Patience, 09/April/2018***\n   "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"47e7d3c036df5b2169b91fc69a81b49c0d42f322"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

What is Pandas?** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"whatispandas\"></a>\n\nPandas is a Python libary that stands for \"Python Data Analysis Library\".  It is one of the most preferred tools in data wrangling. It makes analysing data in Python super easy.\n\nIt provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. \n\nThe object that makes Pandas so useful is an object called a dataframe. It is a structure with rows and columns, much like a relational database table or Excel file, and it can be used to to store CSV,  TSV files, or even a SQL result set."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd #importing pandas for dataframe manipulation, data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9d176d95-4b43-4c59-ace7-fe17968ecd8f","_uuid":"6186fb0eae934da8120f7e46d1c1bb1f3dcc9be0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2.

Perhaps they'd like to know distribution of Pokémon types, or the mean Attack and Defence statistics of Lengendaries, you might be asked to predict or estimate a new Pokémon, or maybe you'd just like to know which Pokémon to concentrate your resource into to catching (It's MewTwo!). \n\nRegardless, before you start by loading your data and studyingit.

In reality, our datasets are normally quite dirty and messy so this step is  vitaly important in data analysis.\n\nThis step is entirely down to the content of the data and will require you to do some work to cleanse the data. For example, we might want to check for Null values ```df.isnull()```, or ```df.isnull().sum()``` to get a summary. To deal with them you might want to drop the rows (```df.drop()```) or to populate a value to replace the null ```(df.fillna(x))```python  or fill in the blanks with the mean value (```df.fillna(df.mean())```).\n\nI find that carrying out cleansing in stages can be helpful if we ever need to revert to a version of the dataset.

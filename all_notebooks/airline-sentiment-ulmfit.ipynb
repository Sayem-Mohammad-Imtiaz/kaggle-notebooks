Problem Statement"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will be tackling the **ULMFiT Sentiment** problem from Fellowship.ai which states:\n\n> Apply a supervised or semi-supervised ULMFiT model to Twitter US Airlines Sentiment\n\nThe Twitter US Airlines Sentiment is this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment#Tweets.csv and the ULMFiT model was introduced here: http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2018/05/15/introducing-ulmfit.html."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2. Our Approach"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2.1 Data exploration and processing\n\nAfter doing some data exploration, we see that the sentiments are heavily biased towards negative and that the distribution of airline sentiments depends on the specific airline. For example, tweets about Virgin America tend to be more positive than the others.\n\nThe imbalanced data suggests that accuracy should not be our only performance metric. To this end, we will also perform a ROC and AUC analysis on the resulting model.\n\nSince the distribution of airline sentiments depend on the specific airline and each tweet contains `@{airline}`, we will do a bit of pre-processing. We will substitute `@{airline}` with `@airline`, for example, `@united` becomes `@airline`. The goal of the substition is to avoid training the model to determine sentiment using the additional data of which airline the tweet was sent towards."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2.2 Model training\n\nWe follow the ULMFiT approach of Howard and Ruder found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf. We will also make extensive use of the `fastai` package as the methods describe in the paper are implemented in this package. The paper discuss applying ULMFiT to a IMDB sentiment problem and provides an example notebook (https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/examples/ULMFit.ipynb). That notebook was followed in the creation of this notebook.\n\nFigure 1 of the Howard and Ruder paper outlines the 3 steps of language model transfer learning.\n\n1. **LM pre-training**: This step was done in 3.2 simply by using the builtin `language_model_learner` of `fastai`. This fetches a language model built using the `wiki103`  dataset (derived from Wikipedia articles )by Howard and Ruder. This step had a large computational cost. The goal of trasfer learning and the ULMFiT approach is to take this pre-trained model and fine-tune it to our problem.\n\n2. **LM fine-tuning**: The langugage of Wikipedia is different from that of Twitter so we need to fine-tune the language model to the dataset we're interested in. This was done in section 3.3.\n\n3. **Classifer fine-tuning**: A language model predicts the next word given the beginning of a sentence. This is not what we want. So we replace the last layers with some layers for sentiment classification. This was done in section 3.4.\n\nThe above descrive a fairly generic overview of language model transfer learning. If applied naively, overfitting on the smaller dataset is proned to happen and ''castastrophpic forgetting'' occurs, as described in the paper. The Howard and Ruder paper proposes method to avoid this. They propose 'discriminative fine-tuning' (Discr),  'slanted triangular learning rate' (STLR), and gradual unfreezing. All of these techniques have been implemented and somewhat abstrated away in the `fastai` package. We only have to provide a few parameters."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.3. Results\n\nThis is a summary of section 4.\n\nWe were able to obtain a final accuracy of 83.7%. But since the data was not balanced, we consider other performance metrics. \n\nIn 4.3, we treat our model as a scorer rather than a classifier which enables us to compute ROC curves by considering different thresholds. We plot the one vs. rest ROC curves and also compute the ROC-AUC. We obtain values of .941, .911, .960 when negative, neutral, and positive were taken as the one in one vs. rest, respectively.\n\nMoreover, in 4.4, we consider adapting our model to a binary classifier where the Positive class is the negative sentiment and the Negative class is the combination of the positive and neutral sentiment. We do this by taking the Positive class whenever a threshold is surpassed. We will determine the optimal threshold given costs assigned to False Positives and False Negatives."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

We will assign negative sentiment tweets the Positive class and positive and neutral sentiment tweets the Negative class. In this suitation a False Positive will cost wasting a small amount of an employee's time and a False Negative will cost them a company image hit.

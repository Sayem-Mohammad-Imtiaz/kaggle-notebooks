the dataset provided has missing values and low-reading counts across various aspects\n>   - multiple tables have missing values for features like pollutants, AQI and AQI Bucket (reducing resolution and reliability)\n>   - there is a discrepancy in the statuses of the stations providing readings (although might be a less serious issue)\n>   - readings provided by inactive or unknown status stations - these could be considered less reliable, erroneous or inconsistent\n>   - number of readings between cities and states vary due to the available stations assigned to each location (impacts resolution and reliability)\n> - it is indeed tricky to make conclusions given the above situation with the data provided\n> - we have two groups of cities that could be helped to improve the Air Quality:\n>   - cities with known low-rate of Acceptable AQ (low AQI values) or high-rate of Unacceptable AQ (high AQI values)\n>     - **Guwahati, Ahmedabad and Delhi**\n>   - cities whose Acceptable AQ or Unacceptable AQ values cannot be easily determined due to one or more of the issues outlined above\n>     - **Ernakulam, Kochi and Lucknow (getting readings from Inactive and Unknown status stations)**\n>     - **Aizawl, Shillong, Coimbatore, Ernakulam, Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Brajrajnagar, Amaravati, Bhopal, Chandigarh (missing AQI Bucket across one or more bucket types)**\n> - so one hand we have cities that show urgent need for help with their AQ with the help of readings and metrics while on the other hand we are struggling to determine the same for those who don't have reliable infrastructure\n> - unreliablility and uncertainty could also be due to negligence or lack of resources to maintain a stable station capturing important AQ measurements\n> - while it may appear cities with bigger AQ issues might be important, they could also be expensive and technically or pollitically hard to implement\n> - on the other hand smaller cities that might be stuggling to keep up with the latest infrastructure and systematic approach might be more feasible and less expensive to fix\n> - **bigger cities are harder to change and keep up with and the lessons are not learnt easily for a long time**\n> - while smaller cities maybe be relatively easier to guide and bring them up to speed and discipline, and these might spread the word to neighbouring cities and towns and help foster better well-being in those areas\n> - also these small cities when they grow and get better connected with other big and small cities will be better equipped to handle such situations\n> - **lessons learnt from simpler implementations can be passed on to other experiments and implementations across the country, sometimes fixing small and simple things from the top five list can resolve many other items in the rest of the list**\n> - we haven't come up with a way to assess the correctness of the data and the accuracy of our analysis and interpretations\n> - we need more data about the regions, states and cities to understand a bit more about what is leading to the Air Quality\n> - and we haven't come up with a way to assess which cities have a bigger need for help (these could be a mix of the cities from the two groups)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='missing_values_four_tables'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## Filling missing values (rest of the four tables)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_station_hour['AQI_Bucket'] = df_station_hour['AQI_Bucket'].fillna('Unknown')\ndf_city_hour['AQI_Bucket']    = df_city_hour['AQI_Bucket'].fillna('Unknown')\ndf_station_day['AQI_Bucket']  = df_station_day['AQI_Bucket'].fillna('Unknown')\ndf_city_day['AQI_Bucket']     = df_city_day['AQI_Bucket'].fillna('Unknown')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='missing_values'></a>\n\n----------\n\n## Filling missing values (Stations table)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### After filling in missing values in the original Stations table\nThe status field has a number of NaN values, about 97 of the stations and also see the proportion of inactive, active and unknown status stations across the various Cities"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_sns_chart(df_stations, 'Status', \n               xlabel_title=\"Number of stations by Status\",\n               ylabel_title=\"Station Status\", height=5.0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"active_stations_filter = df_stations['Status'] == 'Active'\nplot_sns_chart(df_stations[active_stations_filter].sort_values(by='City'), 'City', 'Status', \n               xlabel_title=\"Number of stations Active stations per City\", ylabel_title = \"Cities\",\n               height=30.0, font_scale=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"active_stations_filter = df_stations['Status'] == 'Inactive'\nplot_sns_chart(df_stations[active_stations_filter].sort_values(by='City'), 'City', 'Status', \n               xlabel_title=\"Number of stations Inactive stations by City\", ylabel_title = \"Cities\",\n               height=3, font_scale=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"active_stations_filter = df_stations['Status'] == 'Unknown'\nplot_sns_chart(df_stations[active_stations_filter].sort_values(by='City'), 'City', 'Status', \n               xlabel_title=\"Number of stations Unknown stations by City\", ylabel_title = \"Cities\",\n               height=35.0, font_scale=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<i><p style=\"font-size:16px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">From the above graphs we can see that there is a big divide between the spread of `Active` and `Unknown` status stations in various cities across the country.

The question remains, why `Inactive` stations would give readings. Is it they gave readings for a period and then stopped giving readings. To be precise we have readings from Inactive/Unknown statuses from stations in Delhi, Lucknow, Ernakulam and Kotchi. The number of readings provided are also not very large which also means if they are unreliable then the impact is mixed, depending on the total number of Active stations constituting readings to these regions.\n    \n<i><p style=\"font-size:18px; background-color: #FFF1D7; border: 2px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">Same with the `Unknown` status stations, is it a similar situation and the dataset wasn't kept up-to-date.

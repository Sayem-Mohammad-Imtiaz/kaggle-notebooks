Should I continue using Python, a language I was comfortable with from a web development context, or should I learn the R package? Which blogs should I follow to get the best up-to-date content? How useful are MOOCs available on platforms such as edX and Coursera? Which ML algorithms and techniques tend to perform best in Kaggle Competitions? \n\nUnfortunately, there aren't any objective answers to these questions. A hardcore data engineer will swear by the Python language whereas a statistician is more likely to prefer R. However, what we can do is gain an understanding of the public opinion on these topics by collecting answers from diverse groups to the aforemewntioned questions. Fortunately for DS Beginners, Kaggle has given us just that; a treasure trove of data collected from over 15,000 budding and professional data scientists that give us an invaluable glimpse into their preferences, jobs, learning resources and technology stacks.\n\nIn this notebook, I will be using Kaggle's dataset to answer some of the questions that I had when I had started out learning Data Science. I will rely on the MCQ dataset more than the Freeform answers since they are more structured and will tend to contain answers that we expect. An important disclaimer I feel obliged to mention is that **this dataset, being a product of an online survey, is extremely prone to bias.** We will, however, not look too much into this unless absolutely required. We will also assume that the answers given is a good reflection of the opinions of the entire Data Science community in general."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4ed7b353-6bbc-4961-bcc6-a2507c38f65f","_uuid":"080eb186ff6e9b168e6ef25d2c7b422fc25a7557"},"source":"## Loading Data and Libraries"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"41787387-a11c-4f34-9291-6eb4fee3320b","_uuid":"763eb9cf0857ed6a4164bc68cc6a89587ca359cc"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"%matplotlib inline\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nplotly.tools.set_credentials_file(username='rounakbanik', api_key='xTLaHBy9MVv5szF4Pwan')\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a9f2879a-23f5-4e94-8c5b-7d755c5ebc3d","_uuid":"fce8ff3086ae86852fa75fd26919ee2e7261012e"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"mcq = pd.read_csv('../input/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\", low_memory=False)\nmcq.shape"},{"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"32508997-aa5f-4243-a4c4-62306ff75b10","_uuid":"76b2069fca47ad37bdf975e7538c2f6763534cf1"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"ff = pd.read_csv('../input/freeformResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\", low_memory=False)\nff.shape"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9505e962-a7b9-4242-a66c-45dc0069e2f5","_uuid":"781bfe69b433337e5b077818ddbbc88efb02aa40"},"source":"We have data from over **16,716 people**.

It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 0 Understand the problem\nWhat we're trying to do here is classify sign language alphabets."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Set-up and understand data\nIn this step, we layout the tools we will need to solve the problem identified in the previous step.

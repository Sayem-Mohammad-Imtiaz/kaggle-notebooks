The Harm Principle says that the only justification for interfering with the liberty of an individual, against her will, is to prevent harm to others.\n\nSome of the most vulnerable population are newborns, people who are immuno-compromised from diseases such as cancer, and the elderly are highly susceptible to diseases. When more parents choose not to vaccinate their healthy children, those most vulnerable have a much greater chance of becoming ill, since it creates more incubators where infectious disease can live. When all or most people in the same geographic area are vaccinated, infectious diseases have no bodies in which to grow. So, it is supposed, it is impossible to have an outbreak of disease. As the number of unvaccinated people rises due to vaccine refusal, it creates more places for disease to live (inside more bodies).\n\nPREVENTING HARM TO INDIVIDUALS https://med.nyu.edu/highschoolbioethics/sites/default/files/highschoolbioethics/EthicsofVaccinations_Module.pdf"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['Study_Population'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(14, 6))\nax.set_title('Study Population Distribution', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('Study Population', size=14)\nax.set_xlabel('Count', size=14)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Scientists question WHO's proposed Covid-19 Vaccine distribution strategy.\n\nNineteen global health and ethics experts from around the world question the model of vaccine distribution against Covid-19 proposed by the World Health Organization ( WHO ).\n\nThe distribution plan indicated by the WHO foresees that countries receive proportional doses to the populations. It starts with each country receiving vaccines for 3% of the population and continues with proportional supply until each has vaccinated 20% of its citizens.\n\nThe study authors consider, however, that this strategy is flawed, since equally populous countries are facing dramatically different levels of death and economic impacts due to the pandemic. According to the researchers, the plan \"erroneously assumes that equality requires the identical treatment of countries located differently, instead of responding equally to their different needs\".\n\nFor researchers, the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine among countries must be based on three fundamental values: to benefit people and limit damage, prioritize the disadvantaged and give equal moral consideration to all individuals.\n\nThe authors explain that the proposed metrics as the basis for each phase are routinely used in global health, and using them to plan vaccine delivery “will encourage the collection and reporting of accurate data on changes in mortality and poverty related to Covid-19 https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://panoramafarmaceutico.com.br/2020/09/04/covid-19-cientistas-questionam-estrategia-de-distribuicao-de-vacina-proposta-pela-oms/&prev=search&pto=aue"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['Study_Designs'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(14, 6), color='r')\nax.set_title('Study Designs Distribution', size=18, color='r')\nax.set_ylabel('Study Designs', size=14)\nax.set_xlabel('Count', size=14)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['Phase'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(14, 6), color='g')\nax.set_title('Phase Distribution', size=18, color='g')\nax.set_ylabel('Study Phase', size=14)\nax.set_xlabel('Count', size=14)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df[['Study_Population','Participants']].sort_values('Participants', ascending=False), \n                        y = \"Participants\", x= \"Study_Population\", color='Participants', template='ggplot2')\nfig.update_xaxes(tickangle=45, tickfont=dict(family='Rockwell', color='crimson', size=14))\nfig.update_layout(title_text=\"Bioethics Trials and Results\")\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(df['Results_First_Received'],linewidth=3,palette=\"Set2\",edgecolor='black')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.offline as pyo\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nlowerdf = df.groupby('Study_Population').size()/df['Participants'].count()*100\nlabels = lowerdf.index\nvalues = lowerdf.values\n\n# Use `hole` to create a donut-like pie chart\nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=labels, values=values,marker_colors = px.colors.sequential.speed, hole=.6)])\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(18,6))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.countplot(x=df['Study_Population'],hue=df['Results_First_Received'],palette='summer',linewidth=3,edgecolor='white')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.title('First Received Results')\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.countplot(x=df['Conditions'],hue=df['Primary_Completion_Date'],palette='hot',linewidth=3,edgecolor='white')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.title('Primary Completion Dates')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df, x= \"First_Received\", y= \"Conditions\", color_discrete_sequence=['crimson'], title='First Received & Participants Conditions')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Certificate_of_Delay', data = df, palette=\"GnBu_d\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'US_Clinical_Trial_Site', data = df, palette=\"flag\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(133)\nsns.countplot(x= 'Publication_Date', data = df, palette=\"Greens_r\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata   @mpwolke"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

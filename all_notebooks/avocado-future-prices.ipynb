Problem Description\n\nOur general goal is to understand the avacado sales in the US; find useful insights from the dataset that can be used by the farmers/sellers and consumers. Then be quite specific and predict what will be the buying price/Retailers selling price of a single avocado given all the features and only the **month **for date.\n\nI am quite interested with this study, not just because of my love for avocados but because avacado is a farm product. Farm products's prices are highly dependent on supply and demand forces. The supply fluctuates with the seasons; having very little or even no supply during low season and alot of produce during peak seasons. If this scenario is not well managed we see food going to waste during peak seasons. \n\nUsing insights from data, proper management strategies can be developed to ensure that there is proper pricing, well distribution of produce from high peak season regions to low season regions, and food preservation of produce that the market will not consume despite the right price.\n\n\nWe do acknowledge that food supply chain is extremely complex, and the delivery of a single type of food such as avocado to a consumer involves many actors. However, the fact is, the end consumer buying price and and the produce determines how the inbetween will be.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

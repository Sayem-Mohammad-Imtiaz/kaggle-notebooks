Considering **1 team** in **1 season** for **82 games** yielded a prediction accuracy of **57.32%**. Not bad! This leads to some questions however:\n* How does this model scale? We have data for seasons from 2004 to today. Does this accuracy rise or fall?\n* We only considered the previous game for each team. Will our accuracy improve if we consider the previous $n$ games? What is the optimal value of $n$ (or rather, how many previous games are indicative of how well a team will perform on a given night)?\n\n**The Underlying Assumption**: A team that is \"hot\" will \"stay hot\". In more real terms, a team that continuously wins games is likely to continue winning games.\n\n### A Rudimentary Model\n- In their previous $n$ games, team **A** scored an average of $a_1$ points and allowed an average of $a_2$ points.\n- In their previous $n$ games, team **B** scored an average of $b_1$ points and allowed an average of $b_2$ points.\n- If the average of $a_1$ and $b_2$ is larger than the average of $b_1$ and $a_2$, we predict team **A** will win, and vice versa.

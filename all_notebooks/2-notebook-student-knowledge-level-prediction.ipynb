Some methods (e.g., portfolios, pre-tests, auditions) are direct measures of students‚Äô capabilities entering a course or program. Other methods (e.g., students‚Äô self-reports, inventories of prior courses or experiences) are indirect measures.\n\n*Here we have a data that shows Student's Knowldege based on **Perormance** ranked as:-*\n\n1. Very Low\n2. Low\n3. Middle\n4. High\n\n### My belief: -\n> It is very wrong to judge a student's knowledge level based on his/her performance because knowledge can never be summarized on a sheet of paper. Many of the teachers, parents and gaurdians judge the students or kids on there quantitative performance in the school.

First thing first we need to do a bit of cleaning in our provided data to proceed with any kind of analysis or anything.\n2. We got a feature(Column) in our data ' UNS' whose name is to be fixed.\n3. UNS, is a [categorical Data](https://study.com/academy/lesson/categorical-data-definition-analysis-examples.html) which cannot be directly used with our machine learning models.\n\n*Why it can not be used directly?*\n```\nI will be answering the question in a very simple way so that everyone can unerstand. UNS contains strings which are not defined in mathematics or in other words are not understandable by computers so we cannot feed our models these kind of data.\n```\n\n*What should be done to fix this?*\n\n```The computers understand only numbers and hence we will convert our categorical data to numeric data by using an approach called ``` [Label Encoding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-label-encoding-of-datasets-in-python/).\n\n----\n\n# EDA and Modeling objectives: -\n\nAfter understanding basic tasks to carry over data we need to describe and understand big picture.\n1. Analyse Data\n    - Try finding out relation ship among various features of Data.\n    - Knowing what is your target variable in this case it is UNS (Level of Knowledge of a Studen).\n    - Try finding out relationship of target variable with other features.\n    - Note down very specific questions that can or should be answered by this type of data.\n        1. How UNS/Level of Knowledge depends upon PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects)\n        2. Is there any relationship between PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects) and SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails) and much more.\n        3. Id it reliable to predict UNS based upon the other features in the data.\n    - The most important part of EDA is to visualize your data to support you findings.\n    \n  ** The above are some of the basic questions that should be raised by your mind after understanding this data.\n     The main motive behind telling you all this is to make you understand the way you should start questioning your data.** \n\n2.

This labeling or ranking can be considered as classification right? So, this problem or data can only be solved using Machine Learning Classifiers. \n       \n       What I want to tell you is this that to label or classify something on the basis of its feature we use specific Machine learning models.

These cannot be safely imputed other than looking up the developers and publishers manually.  Games in the same series can be developed and even published by different companies.\n* `platforms` likewise has quite a number of missing values.  As with the above, we could look up all of the data, but unfortunately not all data on the source website is complete.\n* `genres` has a few thousand missing values which again is down to the source having a lack of data.  This could likewise be resolved by looking up the specific data for each entry.\n* `release_na`, `release_eu`, and `release_jp` have expected missing values, although it's almost guaranteed that there are genuine missing values here, too.  It is expected that Japan has the lease released games, given the scale of the video games industry in the west.  Europe has a surprisingly high number of missing values given its prominence in the gaming world.

These beans are grown in various parts of the world where they are nutured and distributed all over the world to reach the mouths of almost every single indvidual who loves chocolate. On average, each year, Canadians consume 5.5 kilograms of chocolate, however every citizen of the world has a different liking to different kinds of chocolate. Some may enjoy a highly rich 80% cocoa bean chocolate bar, while others like a more subtle 50 or 60%. In this case study, we explore how taste differs in each individual. \n\nThe purpose of this case study is highlight customer satisfication of chocolate bars, based on the region the cocoa bean is grown, produced, and the percent of cocoa the chocolate bar has in it's ingredients. In order to conduct this analysis, open source data was used from https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings and the program Python 3 will be utlized to conduct the analysis. \n\nConsumer ratings were measured on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 was either unpleasant or unpalatable, 3 was satisfactory and 5 was above and beyond. The chocolate bars were rated by the basis of texture, flavor, aftermelt, and the overall experience. The full experiment was done by Brady Brelinsku and team, and can be found here: http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html\n\nThe questions that this case study will delve deeper into are: \n<br/> 1) What percent of Cocoa has the highest and most consumer ratings ? </n>\n<br/> 2) What are the top 10 countries that produce the highest rated chocolate bars? \n<br/> 3) Which countries have the highest amount of chocolate vendors?\n<br/> 4) How can you compare the maximum cocoa percentage to the cocoa percentage that is most used in chocolate bars? \n\nThis analysis will bring some insight into consumer patterns in the chocolate industry. It will be possible to perhaps see a pattern in the data that could lead us to observe why a specific amount of cocoa is used in chocolate bars and how it will affect consumer rating. Finally, it will show us how geographic factors have an impact on the consumption of chocolate, and where the highest rated chocolate and cocoa beans come from.

First, using the data, I found out how many chocolate bars had 100 % cocoa, which was the maximum amount of cocoa used in this survey, and in chocolate bars in general. Arounf 20 chocolate bars had a percentage of 100% cocoa, all originating from different parts of the world, and sold around the world in different companies. The reason to do so was to find out how consumers are rating chocolate bars that have 100% cocoa. These would be the most rich, and perhaps the most darkest and bitter bars, as they would not have many other ingredients to mask the taste of cocoa. As figure 4 shows us, most consumers do not refer chocolate bars that have 100% cocoa in them. At most, they are rating it at 3.5, with more ratings for around 3.0 (satisfactory), while most individuals felt that these chocolate bars were around a 1.5 - palatable but unpleasant. There are many number of factors that would give this result, one being if this result is due to the bitterness of the chocolate, or, is it because of the type of bean that is used? More experiments would have to follow to solve these questions. \n<br/> Moving forward, I then observed that the mean amount of cocoa percent that was used is 70%. There is probably some reason why this is the most used amount of cocoa - perhaps it has a relationship with how individuals prefer their chocolate bars? I saw that around 672 chocolate bars are made with 70% cocoa in them. We already observed in Figure 3 that most individuals rate chocolate bars with 70% cocoa with a rating of 3.5 (above satisfactory, approaching pleasurable), and when taking a closer look in Figure 4, the result matches. Moreover, when I isolated the two chocolate bars that were rating as \"above and beyond\" (5.0), the data showed me that both of these chocolate bars had a rating of 70%. Most individuals are prefering chocolate bars that have just enough cocoa to taste it in their desserts, but not enough to be overbearing. This would be a result of having a good blend of different ingredients in their chocolate bars, and people enjoying a more diverse chocolatey taste, rather than just tasting pure cocoa bean.

Consumer preference can be useful to determine how well a chocolate bar will sell. For instance, if it is not selling well, is it due to the amount of cocoa is in it? Perhaps the chocolate bar is too costly because of where the bean in coming from. Factors such as these help us get in touch with different factors if customer behaviour and can help us predict how well a chocolate bar will do in the near future. We can see that most chocolate bars that have a cocoa percent of 70% do much better than if they have more or less cocoa. Also, we can observe that cocoa beans that come from South American countries, and African countries are rated much higher, we can then use this data to pitch ideas to companies where the most chocolate is made (USA, France, Canada, etc.) to see if we can increase sales, or perhaps customer preference of certain chocolate bars. The chocolate industry is large, and quite old and customer data helps us be in touch with the comings and goings of chocolate sales and how people are enjoying their chocolate. \n<br/> Thank you for reading, and I hope you found this to be insightful.

Today, the Museum’s evolving collection contains almost 200,000 works from around the world spanning the last 150 years. The collection includes an ever-expanding range of visual expression, including painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, photography, architecture, design, film, and media and performance art.\n\nMoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use our collection. The Museum’s website features 88,398 artworks from 26,422 artists. This research dataset contains 138,161 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA’s collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum. Some of these records have incomplete information and are noted as “not Curator Approved.”\n\nThe Artists dataset contains 15,282 records, representing all the artists who have work in MoMA's collection and have been cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each artist, including name, nationality, gender, birth year, death year, Wiki QID, and Getty ULAN ID.\n\n## Import libraries and Data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.style as style\nstyle.use('fivethirtyeight')\nfrom collections import Counter","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"artists = pd.read_csv(\"../input/museum-of-modern-art-collection/Artists.csv\")\nartworks = pd.read_csv(\"../input/museum-of-modern-art-collection/Artworks.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Explore Artists Data Set","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"artists.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.hist(artists[artists.BeginDate!=0]['BeginDate'])\nplt.title('Number of Artists by Date of Birth')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.hist(artists[artists.EndDate!=0]['EndDate'])\nplt.title('Number of Artists by Date of Death')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Counter(artists['Gender'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Explore Artworks Data Set","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"artworks.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(artworks['Width (cm)'], artworks['Height (cm)'], 'o')\nplt.title('Width vs. Height of Artworks \\n in MoMA Collection')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explore Paintings","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"paintings = artworks[artworks['Classification'] == 'Painting']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"paintings.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(paintings['Width (cm)'], paintings['Height (cm)'], 'o')\nplt.title('Width vs. Height of Paintings \\n in MoMA Collection')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

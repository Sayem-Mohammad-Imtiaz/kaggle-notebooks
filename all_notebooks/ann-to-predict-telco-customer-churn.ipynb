We will be able to identify those features using exploratory data analysis. We will also build the model which can predict whether that customer churn or not. So based on our EDA analysis the company can design the proactive program that will avoid all those factors which leads to customer attrition and using our ML model they can periodically check whether the customer can leave or not and accordingly take measures to retain the customer.\n\n# Approach <a id =\"3\"></a>\nAfter you clearly define the Machine Learning problem it's time to finalize the approach to achieve it. There are many algorithms, tools and libraries to choose from. In this case we are going to build Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection. We will use TensorFlow deep learning framework to build our model.\n\nCustomer churn (rate) is the measure of the number of individuals or items moving out of a collective group over a specific period. It is one of two primary factors that determine the steady-state level of customers a business will support. \n\nNote: It's not required to use ANN for this problem you can also get very good results using Logistic Regression."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries <a id =\"4\"></a>\nAs per our final approach lets import all the necessary libraries that we will use over the course of this project."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Collection <a id =\"5\"></a>\nOur data is in tabular format and source is CSV file.

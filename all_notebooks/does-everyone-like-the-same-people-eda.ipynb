From the graph there's quite a spread in ratings. For instance, some people that rate themselves 8 only got an average of 3 from their dates. One person who rated themselves 4 was rated an average of 8 by their dates. We can see the most successful people were judged most attractive as is expected. \n* The ratings for fun follow a similar pattern as attraction.\n* The sincerity rating has no correlation at all between self rating and average rating, this may be because it's a hard thing to judge in a short amount of time. Some people who rated themselves 2 actually got rated around 7.5 by their partners. \n* There is also no correlation between self rating on intelligence and rating by partners, this is probably for similar reasons.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"63e413f5-555b-427c-98a0-ec9dc559e5b9","_cell_guid":"6a4f820b-30e6-4e02-b4ad-fb59ee6c14db","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corr = joined.corr()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e245cc38-bb32-4520-8066-c96ead4e5e83","_cell_guid":"406b5c80-b2c4-42bc-b81e-ca7dd780861c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,5));\nplt.subplot(1,5,1);\nsns.scatterplot(joined['attr3_1'],joined['attr_o'],hue=joined['dec_o'],cmap='coolwarm',s=50,legend=False);\nplt.xlabel('self rated');\nplt.ylabel('average rating by partner');\nplt.title('attraction corr= {:0.2f}'.format(corr['attr3_1']['attr_o']));\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.subplot(1,5,2);\nsns.scatterplot(joined['sinc3_1'],joined['sinc_o'],hue=joined['dec_o'],cmap='coolwarm',s=50,legend=False);\nplt.xlabel('self rated');\nplt.ylabel('average rating by partner');\nplt.title('sinserity corr= {:0.2f}'.format(corr['sinc3_1']['sinc_o']));\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.subplot(1,5,3);\nsns.scatterplot(joined['fun3_1'],joined['fun_o'],hue=joined['dec_o'],cmap='coolwarm',s=50,legend=False);\nplt.xlabel('self rated');\nplt.ylabel('average rating by partner');\nplt.title('fun corr= {:0.2f}'.format(corr['fun3_1']['fun_o']));\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.subplot(1,5,4);\nsns.scatterplot(joined['intel3_1'],joined['intel_o'],hue=joined['dec_o'],cmap='coolwarm',s=50,legend=False);\nplt.xlabel('self rated');\nplt.ylabel('average rating by partner');\nplt.title('intellegence corr= {:0.2f}'.format(corr['intel3_1']['intel_o']));\nplt.tight_layout();\nplt.subplot(1,5,5);\nsns.scatterplot(joined['amb3_1'],joined['amb_o'],hue=joined['dec_o'],cmap='Wistia',s=50,legend=False);\nplt.xlabel('self rated');\nplt.ylabel('average rating by partner');\nplt.title('ambition corr= {:0.2f}'.format(corr['amb3_1']['amb_o']));\nplt.tight_layout();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Which attributes predict success?**\nAs we said earlier, are going to use the fraction of daters' partners that wanted to see them again to define success in speed dating. \n\n\nThe sidewards scrolling table below shows the corrolation statistic; it's sorted so the most correlated comes first. Some intersting attributes are then plotted below to visualise this corrolation. The points on the graph are coloured by sex. As we have seen above, men and women approach speed dating differently, so this is an important aspect to investigate further.\n\nKey insights:\n* The most correlated attribute to success is a high average attraction score given by partners (0.79). This is to be expected, as people are likely to find the people they want to see again attractive. Also more attractive people are likely to give a better first impression, which is important in speed dating.\n\n* Self rated attraction score is only correlated at 0.19, which is much lower, but still slightly correlated. From the graphs below we can see that people who rated themselves lower than 5 in attractiveness are less successful in speed dating, but above this there does not appear to be a strong pattern. We saw above that self rated attraction is not necessarily related to how their dates perceived them.\n\n* The most corrolated attribute not rated by the partners is the expected number of daters the partner expected to get. This is interesting because it suggests that the daters themselves knew objectively how popular they would be at speed dating, this is better correlated than self rated attraction. (0.24)\n\n* As we saw before, gender is correlated with how many of their partners want to see them again. Men want to see more women again, than women want to see men. (-0.22)\n\n* The fraction of their partners the dater themselves want to see again is inversely correlated with the fraction of partners who want to meet them again (-0.26). We touched on this earlier.

Thus I scraped data from a whisky information website called WhiskyDatabase.\n\nIn this report, I am gpoing to do simple EDA of two datasets, one of which is on distilleries and the other on is on whisky brands. These two datasets are unique datasets since data objects came from all around the world. When people talk about whisky, they mostly refer to whisky made in 5 main countries such as Scotland, Ireland, United States, Canada, and Japan. This is because they were the pioneer countries in the whisky industry and have been leading the industry in terms of producing and selling.\n\n#### What is \"New World Whisky\"?\nThese year, however, whisky lovers are paying attentions to countries apart from the 5 main countries in order to seek different flavor. Thus the popularity of new countries is rapidly growing, and they are now called \"New World Whisky\".\nSo, in this report I am going to focus on new world whisky and hopefully you found this analysis insightful and interesting.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/koki25ando/Photos/imasia_14333957_S.jpg)\n\n### Data Source\n[WhiskyDatabase](https://www.whiskybase.com/):\n\n### Research Questions\n- What Coutries are producing whisky the most?\n- Which new world whisky should I try and recommend others?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d81043b3e443b7160ea51b93d7d0085defd34b3e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preparation\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n# Data Import & Cleaning\nDistillery = pd.read_csv(\"../input/world-whisky-distilleries-brands-dataset/Distillery.csv\")\nDistillery = Distillery.iloc[:, 1:]\n\nCountry_Code = pd.read_csv(\"../input/country-code/country_code.csv\")\nCountry_Code = Country_Code.iloc[:, 1:]\n\nBrand = pd.read_csv(\"../input/world-whisky-distilleries-brands-dataset/Whisky_Brand.csv\")\nBrand = Brand.iloc[:, 1:7]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"51fd3a3de9c9810a77b5b352da49324f991271dc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Data Content\nDistillery.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"042c5242bdd92f6db3815ce50f24d3ad02bd572e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Distillery.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"94602cbfeb64d05b1c85d2bda7609330ccfb2c59"},"cell_type":"code","source":"type(Distillery)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"5632c0a83ee3070169057d623579cd557272f93d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Distillery.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b1e3d524ed57e7cae6e35e8ced8e039f420f6233"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Distillery['Rating'] = pd.to_numeric(Distillery['Rating'], errors='coerce')\nDistillery = Distillery.dropna(subset=['Rating'])\nsns.distplot(Distillery['Rating'], kde = False, bins = 90)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"229fd2225de36ef1163c6fa3329b97a8586c1d31"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you noticed, there are so many ditilleries whose ratings are 0.\nThis suggests that there are so many tiny or newly constructed distilleries.

However, if you know familiar with how whiskies are made, this result would not be surprising at all. I am not going to talk about this topic deeply but it is pretty well known that the process of producing whisky is pretty similar to the one of producing beer. Since they both have common techniques and obviously Germany is a country which is famous for the people love beer a lot, this is why the number of distilleries is high and most of them could be beer breweries as well.\n\nFrom now on, to focus a little bit more on new world whisky, I am going to delete data on distilleries in 5 main countries."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"41d101dfa22067445db36ea3813bdf27767150eb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"NW_Distillery = Distillery[(Distillery['Country'] != \"Japan\") & (Distillery['Country'] != \"Scotland\") & \n                                     (Distillery['Country'] != \"United States\") & (Distillery['Country'] != \"Canada\") & \n                                     (Distillery['Country'] != \"Ireland\")]\nCountry = NW_Distillery['Country'].value_counts()\nCountry = pd.DataFrame({'Country':Country.index,'Count':(Country.values)})\n\nbarplot2 = [go.Bar(\n            x=Country['Country'],\n            y=Country['Count']\n    )]\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    title = 'Distillery Number of Each New World Whisky Country'\n)\nfig = go.Figure(data = barplot2, layout = layout)\niplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52c144558d7f0cc9af1a4f93cd1eed99adf008a9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we saw previous bar chart, German is the leading country. \nOther top countries are mostly european countries such as Austria, France, Netherland, etc..."},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":false,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"37aace38b255f4c2976e6f35be193b2a8218b775"},"cell_type":"code","source":"Country_Rating = NW_Distillery.groupby(\"Country\").mean()[\"Rating\"]\nCountry_Rating = Country_Rating.to_frame()\nCountry_Rating['Country'] = Country_Rating.index\nCountry_Rating = Country_Rating.sort_values(by = 'Rating', ascending=False)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\nsns.barplot(\n    data = Country_Rating,\n    x = \"Rating\",\n    y = \"Country\"\n)\nplt.axvline(60, color = 'r')\nplt.title(\"Average Rating Scores of Whisky Disitilleries for each Country\", fontsize = 20)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e4b8aa18cf3003b1a978b7260bf6257893dab104"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Based on the average rating scores for each country, I am going to focus on countries whose ratings are above 60 points.

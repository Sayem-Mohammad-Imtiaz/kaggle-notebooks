{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Automated machine learning (AutoML)** is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. In a typical machine learning application, the typical stages (and sub-stages) of work are the following:\n1. Data preparation\n  * data pre-processing\n  * feature engineering\n  * feature extraction\n  * feature selection\n2. Model selection\n3. Hyperparameter optimization (to maximize the performance of the final model)\n\nMany of these steps are often beyond the abilities of non-experts. **AutoML** was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning. \n\nSome of the notable platforms tackling various stages of AutoML are the following:\n* [auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/) is a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization layer on top of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).\n* [TPOT](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot) (TeaPOT) is a Python library that automatically creates and optimizes full machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.\n* [TransmogrifAI](https://github.com/salesforce/TransmogrifAI) is a Scala/SparkML library created by [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com/) for automated data cleansing, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimization.\n* [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) performs (simple) data preprocessing, automates the process of training a large selection of candidate models, tunes hyperparameters of the models and creates stacked ensembles.\n* [H2O Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/) is a commercial software package that automates lots of aspects of machine learning applications. It has a strong focus on automatic feature engineering. \n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U h2o","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nprint(h2o.__version__)\nfrom h2o.automl import H2OAutoML\n\nh2o.init(max_mem_size='16G')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ntrain = h2o.import_file(\"/kaggle/input/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists/aug_train.csv\")\ntest = h2o.import_file(\"/kaggle/input/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists/aug_test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = test.columns\ny = 'target'\ntrain[y] = train[y].asfactor()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"aml = H2OAutoML(max_models=20, seed=2020, max_runtime_secs=15000)\naml.train(x=x, y=y, training_frame=train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# View the AutoML Leaderboard\nlb = aml.leaderboard\nlb.head(rows=lb.nrows)  # Print all rows instead of default (10 rows)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The leader model is stored here\naml.leader","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = aml.predict(test)\npreds['p1'].as_data_frame().values.flatten().shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Vague and generic messages are far less likely to resonate with audiences than specific, direct communication – which is why targeting in marketing is so important.\nSmart marketers understand the importance of \"know thy customer\". Instead of simply focusing on generating more clicks, marketers must follow the paradigm shift from increased CTRs (Click-Through Rates) to retention, loyalty, and building customer relationships.\n\nInstead of analyzing the entire customer base as a whole, it's better to segment them into homogeneous groups, understand the traits/behaviour of each group, and engage them with relevant targeted campaigns. \n\nOne of the most popular, easy-to-use, and effective segmentation methods which enable marketers to analyze the customer behavior is RFM analysis.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.

Conclusion","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"RFM is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that allows marketers to make informed decisions. It empowers marketers to quickly identify and segment users into homogeneous groups and target them with differentiated and personalized marketing strategies. This in turn improves user engagement and retention.\n\nI have used equal weightage scheme for each RFM variables in this analysis. But depending on the nature of your businesses, you can increase or decrease the relative importance of each RFM variable to arrive at the final score. For example:\n\n* In a *consumer durables* business, the monetary value per transaction is normally high but frequency and recency is low. For example, you can’t expect a customer to purchase a refrigerator or air conditioner on a monthly basis. In this case, a marketer could give more weight to monetary and recency aspects rather than the frequency aspect.\n\n* In a *retail* business, customers purchase products every month or every week, so they will have a higher recency and frequency score than monetary score. Accordingly, the RFM score could be calculated by giving more weight to R and F scores than M.\n\n* For *streaming* business like Hotstar or Netflix, a binge watcher will have a longer session length than a mainstream consumer watching at regular intervals. For bingers, engagement and frequency could be given more importance than recency, and for mainstreamers, recency and frequency can be given higher weights than engagement to arrive at the RFE score.\n\nThanks for reading this far.

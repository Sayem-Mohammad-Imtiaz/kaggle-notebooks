They allow people to enjoy biking around the city without investing in buying a bike for themselves, by providing affordable bike rentals.  Here in the twin cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN) we have the bike-sharing nonprofit [Nice Ride MN](https://www.niceridemn.org/).  Customers can rent bikes at stations, each of which has docks for several bikes, and are scattered throughout the cities.  Customers can then bike around, and return their bike at any other station (providing there's an empty dock for it).  \n\nNice Ride MN provides public access to their [historical data](https://www.niceridemn.org/data/), and that data is published under the [Nice Ride Minnesota Data License Agreement](https://www.niceridemn.org/data_license/).  In this EDA, we'll explore Nice Ride's data from the 2017 year by looking at things like bike demand across different stations, the flow of bikes from and to each station, seasonality and weather effects on ride patterns, and differences in ride patterns between members and non-members.  We'll be using Python with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for data manipulation; [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), and [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) for visualization; and [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) for a small bit of statistical modeling.\n\n## Outline\n- [Data Loading and Cleaning](#loading-and-cleaning)\n- [Station Locations](#station-locations)\n- [Number of Bike Docks per Station](#number-of-docks)\n- [Station Demand](#station-demand)\n    - [Difference in demand](#difference-in-demand)\n    - [Difference in demand over time](#demand-over-time)\n    - [Cumulative difference in demand](#cumulative-difference)\n    - [Optimal initial number of bikes](#optimal-initial-number)\n    - [Demand Range](#demand-range)\n- [Flow](#flow)\n- [Ride Season](#ride-season)\n- [Ride durations](#ride-durations)\n- [Weather](#weather)\n- [Rental dependence on season](#dependence-on-season)\n- [Memberships](#memberships)\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nLet's load the packages we'll use, and then we can get to the data."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Packages\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfrom numpy import log\n\n# Matplotlib settings\n%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\nsns.set()\n\n# Bokeh settings\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show\nfrom bokeh.io import output_notebook\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Circle, HoverTool, ColorBar, LinearColorMapper, LogColorMapper, CustomJS, Slider\nfrom bokeh.palettes import Viridis256, brewer\nfrom bokeh.tile_providers import CARTODBPOSITRON_RETINA\nfrom bokeh.models.widgets import Panel, Tabs\nfrom bokeh.layouts import column\nfig_height = 500\nfig_width = 800\noutput_notebook()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5895ec2234a282986040b501b1e2d37f938d2620"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='loading-and-cleaning'></a>\n## Data Loading and Cleaning\n\nFirst, let's load the data and take a look at the data to see if it needs any cleaning."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b281075e5c141f7799ec6bbba46618fc8b32a88b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load data\nstations = pd.read_csv('../input/Nice_Ride_2017_Station_Locations.csv')\ntrips = pd.read_csv('../input/Nice_ride_trip_history_2017_season.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5a288ab07e21f026613e1643f1a51a58b2101779"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show some of the stations data\nstations.sample(n=5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fe2f3ca967dc2c68827ae1ba8ee3d0f6535f02f2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Print info about each column\nfor col in stations:\n    print('\\n',col,'\\nNulls:',stations[col].isnull().sum(),'\\n',stations[col].describe())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7630cca1eccb7936506fa831eedf8f8586a877b9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The stations dataset looks pretty clean - no missing values, and the latitude, longitude, and number of docks loaded as expected.

There are some stations at which far more people are ending their trips than starting them (e.g. the station at Lake St & Knox Ave, at the northeast corner of Bde Maka Ska, or the Minnehaha Park station).  There are also stations at which far more people are *starting* their trips than ending them (e.g. the stations at Coffman Union and Wiley Hall on the Univeristy of Minnesota campus).  But the majority of stations have about as many inbound as outbound rides (e.g. the two stations by Como Lake, which you can barely see on the differences map!).  \n\nPlotting the difference in demand by location also reveals an interesting rental flow pattern: it appears that, on average, more rides start from downtown Minneapolis or the U of M campus and go away from downtown.  Notice how there's a lot of large blue circles (stations with more outbound rides) clustered around downtown Minneapolis, but most of the large red circles (stations with more inbound rides) lie away from downtown, and tend to be \"destinations\" and parks (such as Minnehaha Park, Bde Maka Ska, Logan Park, and North Mississippi Regional Park)\n\n<a id='difference-in-demand'></a>\n### Difference in demand\n\nIs this difference in demand going to be a problem for Nice Ride?  Ideally, Nice Ride will want to have more docks at stations where there is large difference between the number of incoming and outgoing rides.  This is because if more rides are starting at a given station than ending there, the number of bikes at that station will decrease as the day goes on.  So, there needs to be enough docks at that station to hold enough bikes so the station isn't empty by the end of the day!  On the other hand, if more rides are *ending* at a station than are beginning there, all the docks at that station will fill up and people won't be able to end their rides there!  So those stations must have enough docks to absorb the amount of incoming traffic over the course of a day.\n\nStations which have a good balance of the number of rides coming in to the number of rides going out don't need quite as many docks - because about as many bikes are being taken from that station as are being left there.  Of course, there's also the issue of time - some stations may see different demand depending on the time of day, week, or season - but we'll get to that later. With a good match of the number of docks at each station to the difference between incoming and outgoing trips, Nice Ride won't have to spend as much time during prime riding hours re-distributing bikes from low-demand stations (with extra unused bikes) to high-demand stations (with not enough bikes!).  How well does this distribution of demand differences match up with the distribution of the number of docks at each station?

During the evening commute however (~4-5pm), stations downtown and at the U of M are depleted and there is an influx of rides to stations in surrounding residential areas.\n\nThis pattern can actually work in Nice Ride's favor.  Suppose a station has a bunch of bikes leaving in the morning.  As long as there were lots of bikes there in the morning, if they all come back in the evening, then that's great for Nice Ride - they don't have to re-distribute the bikes to that station! The only time when bike distribution problems arise is when (1) there is an imbalance in the ride distribution on average, or (2) there aren't enough docks at a station to buffer the daily fluxuations in demand at that station. \n\nEarlier we looked at which stations have imbalances in the ride distribution on average (the horizontal bar plot with difference in demand and # docks for each station).  That analysis tells us about which stations we can expect to see become depleted over the course of the day, and *not* be replenished, or vice versa.  This problem can be alleviated at a given station by increasing the number of docks at a station, but that won't *fix* the problem.  Even with a large number of docks at a station, the imbalance will add up over time.  No matter what, Nice Ride will have to re-distribute bikes to/from these stations.  That's why we shouldn't worry as much about trying to match the number of docks at a station to its demand difference on average.  However, the other problem *can* be fixed by optimizing the number of docks at each station.  \n\n<a id='cumulative-difference'></a>\n### Cumulative difference in demand\n\nThat second problem is the issue of the demand changing over time.  Even when a station has an even balance in inbound to outbund trips on average, we want there to be enough docks at a station to buffer imbalances that happen over the course of a day.  For example, suppose a station has, on average, 10 outbound rentals in the morning, and then 10 inbound rentals in the afternoon.  There's a perfect balance on average, so Nice Ride doesn't have to worry too much about re-distributing bikes to or from that station.  \n\nBut only if the station has enough docks!  What if the station only has 5 docks?  Then the station will run out of available bikes halfway through the morning, and Nice Ride will have to bring 5 bikes to the station from some other station so that more people can rent from that station.  If they don't, Nice Ride will miss out on revenue!  And in the afternoon, the station will fill up, and Nice Ride will have to take 5 bikes *away* from the station to a different station, so that there are empty docks where people can end their rides.  If they don't, customers will be pissed that they can't end their ride where they wanted to.  So if the station doesn't have enough docks, Nice Ride will have to re-distribute bikes to and from that station *every day!*\n\nWe need to optimize the number of docks at each station in order to minimize the amount of bike re-distribution that's required.  To do that, we'll take a look at the cumulative difference in demand at each station.  The cumulative difference in demand is, at a given time of day, how many more (or less) bikes are at station than were there at the beginning of the day.  Using this analysis, we can answer some important questions about bike re-distribution of bikes at each station:\n- Which stations have a large imbalance?\n- In which direction is that imbalance? (i.e. does Nice Ride need to bring bikes to that station, or take them away?)\n- When is that imbalance worst?\n- What is the optimal number of bikes to have at each station at the beginning of the day?\n- What is the optimal number of docks to have at each station?\n\nLet's compute the cumulative difference in demand at each station.  We'll also normalize by the number of days in the Nice Ride season, so that our values reflect how many bikes are at each station across time on an average day (relative to the number of bikes that were there at the beginning of the day)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b71c3dab21d1ee37b795adec8baef562bd2dccd2","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compute the cumulative difference in demand\ncdiff = trips_hp['Difference'].apply(np.cumsum, axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"306e158721443559bfa41c8ad932dc2e53c09ebd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What does the cumulative difference in demand look like for the station at the station at 6th Ave SE & University Ave, which we were looking at earlier?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"27fa4c9a6d71f9d2d8e13f9b002e9b08bcd0eac5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"station_name = '6th Ave SE & University Ave'\n\n# Plot difference in demand at 6th Ave SE & University Ave\nplt.figure()\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 1)\ninds = trips_hp['Difference'].index==station_name\nplt.plot(trips_hp['Difference'].loc[inds,:].values[0], 'y')\nplt.fill_between(np.arange(24), 0, \n                 trips_hp['Difference'].loc[inds,:].values[0],\n                 color='yellow', alpha=0.2)\nplt.xticks(np.arange(0, 25, 6))\nplt.xlabel('Hour')\nplt.ylabel('Average Difference\\n(Inbound - Outbound)')\nplt.show()\n\n# Plot cumulative difference in demand at Lake Street & Knox Ave S\nplt.subplot(2, 1, 2)\nplt.plot(cdiff.loc[station_name, :].index,\n         cdiff.loc[station_name, :].values, 'b')\nplt.fill_between(cdiff.loc[station_name, :].index, 0,\n                 cdiff.loc[station_name, :].values,\n                 color='blue', alpha=0.2)\nplt.xticks(np.arange(0, 25, 6))\nplt.xlabel('Hour')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Difference\\n(Num bikes)')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"08ecd11eaa586fa6e2c7e0878c252ddc6c8e1790"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the cumulative demand difference makes it obvious that a lot of bikes are being taken away from this station during the morning, and then brought back in the evening.

We want to minimize the amount of time that stations are empty when customers are wanting to rent, and the amount of time stations are full when customers are wanting to return their rentals.  To do that we'll define a \"loss\" function for each station.  This loss function takes a hypothetical initial number of bikes, and returns a value which is higher when a station is close to being full and there are more inbound trips than outbound trips, and also higher when a station is close to being empty and there are more outbound trips than inbound trips:\n\n$$ \nL(N_0) = \\int_t \\alpha \\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d ) - (1-\\alpha) \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )  ~ dt\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n- $L(N_0)$ is the loss of starting with N_0 docks at the beginning of the day\n- $D_t$ is the demand difference at time $t$ (inbound rides minus outbound rides)\n- $C_t$ is the cumulative demand difference ($C_t = \\int_0^t D_x ~ dx$)\n- $N_d$ is the number of docks at the station\n- $\\alpha$ is a parameter which controls how bad it is for a station to be full vs being empty\n\nLet's look at each part of that overly-complicated equation.  The integral in the loss equation sums over all the hours of a day (but you could use a finer time bin if you wanted to).  The first half of what's inside the integral ($\\alpha \\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C(t) - N_d )$) is a value which will be large when the station is close to being full and there are more inbound rides than outbound rides.  $\\max(0, D_t)$ is just the difference in demand, but only when it's positive (and 0 when it's negative).  $N_0 + C(t) - N_d$ is the (negative of the) expected number of *empty docks* left at the station.  That way, when the expected number of empty docks at the station is very low, $\\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d )$ will be very high, and vice-versa.  So, when the expected number of empty docks at the station is low *and* the number of inbound trips is high, the value of $\\max(0, D_t) \\exp ( N_0 + C_t - N_d )$ will be large.\n\nBut we also want to penalize having an empty station when people want to rent bikes!  The second half of what's in the integral ($- (1-\\alpha) \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$) is a value which will be large when the station is close to being empty and there are more outbound rides than inbound rides.  $\\min(0, D_t)$ is the difference in demand, but only when it's negative (and 0 when it's positive).  $(- N_0 - C_t)$ is the (negative of the) expected number of bikes left at the station.  That way, when the expected number of bikes available at a station is low, $\\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$ will be very high, and vice-versa.  So when the expected number of available bikes at the station is low *and* the number of outbound trips his high, the value of $- \\min(0, D_t) \\exp ( - N_0 - C_t )$ will be large.\n\nThe $\\alpha$ parameter controls how bad it is to have stations fill up with bikes compared to running out of bikes, and should take values between 0 and 1.  If $\\alpha<0.5$, that means we consider it \"more bad\" when the station is empty but there are people wanting to rent from that station than when it is full and people are wanting to end their rides there.  I'm going to set $\\alpha=0.3$, because to me it seems slightly worse to have a station be empty when someone wants to rent a bike than to have a station be full where someone wants to return a bike.  Either way the customer is pissed, but if the station they want to rent from is empty, they probably won't end up renting a bike, and Nice Ride will miss out on revenue.

We won't do that here, but I hope to do that analysis in a future post.\n\n<a id='demand-range'></a>\n### Demand Range\n\nFinally, we can also compute the optimal number of *docks* for each station to have, given the cumulative difference in demand.  Of course, ideally each station would have *infinite* docks, but Nice Ride doesn't have infinite money.  The best we can do is determine how to optimally *distribute* the docks that Nice Ride can afford across their stations.\n\nEach station should have enough docks to buffer the daily fluxuations in bikes.  Specifically, to avoid re-distribution of bikes, a station needs to have (on average) as many docks as the difference between the maximum and minimum of its cumulative demand difference (or the demand range). \n\nLet's look at this value for an example station.  Below is the cumulative difference in demand for the station at 6th Ave SE & University Ave (cumulative number of inbound minus outbound rides per hour).  The demand range for this station is the difference between the max and minimum of this cumulative difference - the difference between the two dashed lines in the plot below:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"370ef913dc4db406b58b312132abe5dcc9a21cdc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plot cumulative difference at 6th Ave SE & University Ave\nstation_name = '6th Ave SE & University Ave'\nplt.figure()\nRH = cdiff.loc[station_name, :].index\nRC = cdiff.loc[station_name, :].values\nplt.plot(RH, RC, 'b')\nplt.fill_between(RH, 0, RC, color='blue', alpha=0.2)\nplt.plot([0, 23], [RC.max(), RC.max()], 'k--')\nplt.plot([0, 23], [RC.min(), RC.min()], 'k--')\nplt.annotate(s='', xy=(13,RC.min()), xytext=(13,RC.max()), \n             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='<->'))\nplt.xticks(np.arange(0, 25, 6))\nplt.xlabel('Hour')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Difference\\n(Num bikes)')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"24c311b597115702dcfdc9ea15405b4c8aa0c711"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The larger that demand range value is, the more docks the station should have in order to buffer that fluxuation in the number of bikes at the station.\n\nLet's compute the demand range for each station, and see how the distribution of demand ranges compare to the distribution of docks across all stations"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"7b1256131b470cb0f7d91ee4c394509d12828e5a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create dataframe to store demand ranges\nrange_vs_docks = pd.DataFrame(index=stations['Name'].tolist(), \n                              columns=['Range', 'Docks'])\n\n# Compute demand range for each station\nfor s in range_vs_docks.index:\n    RC = cdiff.loc[s, :].values\n    range_vs_docks.loc[s,'Range'] = RC.max() - RC.min()\n    D = stations.loc[stations.Name==s,'Total docks'].values[0]\n    range_vs_docks.loc[s,'Docks'] = D\n    \n# Normalize distributions\nrange_vs_docks = range_vs_docks.apply(lambda x: x/np.sum(x))\n    \n# Tidy the data for seaborn\ntidified = (\n    range_vs_docks\n       .stack()\n       .reset_index()\n       .rename(columns={'level_0': 'Name',\n                        'level_1': 'Distribution', \n                        0: 'Proportion'})\n)\n\n# Show the distributions\nplt.figure(figsize=(4.5, 35))\nstation_list = range_vs_docks.sort_values('Range', ascending=False).index.tolist()\nsns.barplot(y='Name', x='Proportion', hue='Distribution', \n            data=tidified, order=station_list)\nplt.title('Proportion Docks vs Demand Range')\nlocs, labels = plt.yticks()\nplt.yticks(locs, tuple([s[:20] for s in station_list]))\nplt.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=5)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad7b7d3d0b74f93561488a173e60117f5cdf3c03"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There's not a great match between the number of docks and the demand range.  Ideally, those two distributions would look similar.  But it's not an awful match, either - notice how the stations with the lowest demand range usually have the smallest number of docks, and stations with the highest demand range usually have the most docks.\n\nWhy don't the two distributions match better?  Hasn't Nice Ride done their homework?  There are a few reasons why the actual distribution of docks might not align to the demand range as we computed it.\n\nFirst of all, it seems like it would be costly for each station to have a custom number of docks.  As we saw earlier, most stations have 15 docks, with additional increments of 4 docks.  It would seem that the standard station size is 15, with 4-dock add-ons.  It is likely more expensive for Nice Ride to custom-order each station than it is for them to buy mostly stations with the standard number of docks.\n\nSecondly, it is probably less expensive for Nice Ride to pay a few employees to re-distribute bikes over the course of the day than it is for them to buy stations with a bajillion docks.  Ideally, stations with large demand ranges (such as the stations at Hennepin County Gov't Center, Washingon Ave, Coffman Union, etc) would have far more docks, to match their fluxuations in bikes over the course of the day.  However that isn't nessesary - a few employees can re-distribute bikes from and to these stations over the course of the day so that the stations don't fill up or empty.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these demand ranges were calculated using the average over all days of the season!  In reality there's probably a difference based on *what* day it is (e.g. a weekday vs a weekend), whether the day is a holiday, the season/time of year, the weather, and other factors.  It may be most cost-effective for Nice Ride to optimize the number of docks during, say, only the part of the season when they have the most customers.   Or the day of the week, etc.\n\nComputing the average demand range is a simple way to preliminarily estimate how many docks Nice Ride should have at each station.  While it was simple enough to do in a few lines of code, there are more complex ways to more accurately predict optimal parameters for Nice Ride's system.  Ideally, one would want to train a machine learning algorithm to predict the volume of inbound and outbound rides at each station.  Instead of using averages, as we used above, this algorithm could take into consideration the season, day of the week, weather, etc, and output demand predictions.  From those demand predictions we could compute the demand difference and the cumulative demand difference.  Given the average revenue per ride, and the estimated cost of having someone end up at a full station, we could perform a cost-benefit analysis in order to optimize the initial number of bikes at each station, the number of docks at each station, the best times to re-distribute bikes, *and* from/to which stations.  Again, we won't do that here, but I hope to build such a model in a future post."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a49c40c3db35db0d5aecc12c13a7451033cdcef"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='flow'></a>\n## Flow\n\nWe looked at where the Nice Ride stations are located, the number of docks at each station, and the demand at each station and how that demand changes over time.

That is, if the weather was exactly the same, would we still see a change in the number of rides per day over the year?  \n\nThe reason that's important is becuase using that information along with weather predictions, Nice Ride would be able to better decide when to end their rentals for the season.  If there lots of rentals in the fall as long as it's nice out, and weather predictions look pleasant, then Nice Ride might want to extend their rental season.  On the other hand, if customers usually stop renting in fall even when it's nice out, Nice Ride might want to end their season early and save on operating costs.\n\nThere are a few different ways we could go about determining the effect of season on the number of rides, independent from weather.  We could build a model to predict the number of rides per day, which includes season as a predictor, along with the weather and other factors.  We'd probably want to use a 2nd order polynomial to model the seasonal effect, since we're only looking at data from one year:\n\n$$\n\\text{RidesPerDay} \\sim \\beta + \\text{DayOfYear} + \\text{DayOfYear}^2 + \\text{Weather} + \\text{etc...}\n$$\n\nHowever, obviously the season will be highly correlated with the temperature!  That means that some of the temperature's effect on the number of rides may be attributed to season if we try to fit both in the same model.  Just to be safe, let's instead fit a model which includes as predictors everything we care about *except* season, and then look at the residuals of that model as a function of season.  Basically what we'll be doing is \"removing the effect\" of weather from the number of rides, and then looking at how that leftover information changes with season.\n\nFirst, let's fit an ordinary least squares regression model to predict the number of rides per day from the day of the week, the max daily temperature, and the daily precipitation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"899a1b72e30d4050c9935d1df203e373673d8070"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Build dataframe with day and weather\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\ndf['Trips'] = weather.trips\ndf['Date'] = weather.DATE\ndf['Day'] = weather.DATE.dt.dayofweek\ndf['Temp'] = weather.TMAX\ndf['Precip'] = weather.PRCP + 0.001\n\n# Only fit model on days with trips\ndf = df.loc[~np.isnan(df.Trips), :]\ndf.reset_index(inplace=True, drop=True)\n\n# Fit the linear regression model\nolsfit = smf.ols('Trips ~ Temp + log(Precip) + C(Day)', data=df).fit()\n\n# Show a summary of the fit\nprint(olsfit.summary())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"beadc3157baf1207c6cb71ddfd679ca1aeecbac8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our model definitely captured an effect of the weather.

The coefficient for temperature was $\\approx 39.9$, meaning that for every 10 degree increase in the temperature, Nice Ride can expect $\\approx 400$ more rides per day!  But not *exactly* 400 more rides.  The two rightmost columns show the 95% confidence interval, which show that the model is 95% sure the temperature coefficient is between 33.6 and 46.2.  So the model is very sure that the number of rides per day *increases* with temperature (because the 95% confidence interval is completely above 0), but there is uncertainty as to the exactly how strong that relationship is.\n\nSimilarly the coefficient for precipitation is significantly negative, meaning more precipitation means less rides per day.  This makes sense and matches up with our weather analysis from before.\n\nThe `C(Day)` rows show the coefficients for each day of the week.  For example the `C(Day)[T.1]` row is for Tuesday (0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday).  The coefficients for these rows correspond to how may more rides per day we can expect on that day than on a Monday.

We learned some obvious things, such as the fact that most members appear to use Nice Ride for commuting, and the fact that there are more rentals when it's warm out.  We also learned some counter-intuitive things (to me, at least), like the fact that precipitation didn't seem to have a huge impact on ride durations, and that there was actually a seasonal effect on the number of rides which was independent from the weather.\n\nBut how can all this information be used to help Nice Ride's business?  Here are some reccomendations for Nice Ride based on our analyses:\n\n**Continuing the rental season late into the year probably isn't worth it.** There appeared to be a seasonal effect on the volume of rentals which was independent of the weather.  Specifically, there were more rides than would be expected (given the weather) in the summer than in early spring and late fall.  Honestly, I was expecting to see *more* rentals in the fall after accounting for weather - both because bike-riding habits formed during the summer die hard (or so I thought), and because I figured there was a continuous growth in Nice Ride's customer base.  However, it appears this intuition was wrong, and that there's even fewer rentals in late fall and early spring than would be expected based on the weather.  This means that is probably isn't worth it for Nice Ride to continue renting bikes late into fall, because with fewer rides, Nice Ride's operations costs may outweigh their revenue from the decreased volume of rentals.\n\n**Nice Ride may want to consider more optimally distributing their docks.** We found that the distribution of the number of docks at each station didn't match up very well to the difference in cumulative demand over the course of the day.  This means that Nice Ride might be spending more time re-distributing their bikes between stations than they would have to if they more optimally distributed their docks.  Of course, there are restrictions on how Nice Ride can distribute their docks, for example it appears the default number of docks for a station is 15, plus increments of 4.  While it might not be worth it for Nice Ride to perfectly match their docks distribution to the difference in cumulative demands, they may want to take a look at stations where the discrepancy is especially bad, and consider adding docks to those stations.  However, they'll also have to balance the costs of new docks against the costs of simply paying employees to re-distribute the bikes more often.\n\n**It might be worth building a model to suggest how and when to more optimally re-distribute bikes.**  We worked out the cumulative demand at each station over the course of the day using the number of inbound and outbound trips on average over the entire year.  However, one could instead build a model which uses the season, day of the week, time relative to certain holidays, the weather, etc, to forecast how many bikes will be available at each station at a given point in time in the future, and also how many inbound and outbound rides would occur as long as there were enough docks or bikes.  From that information, Nice Ride could optimize how many bikes to move between stations, and when!  This could both cut down on how many re-distribution employees they require, and also help alleviate the need to optimally distribute docks among their stations.\n\n**Advertising for memberships will probably be most effective in the downtown and U of M areas.**  We found that members were far more likely than non-members to start and end rides at stations near downtown and the University of Minnesota.  Assuming that advertisements are more likely to be effective on potential customers who behave similarly to current customers (an assumption which may or may not be valid...), then Nice Ride should target any advertising for memberships at stations near downtown and the U of M, because that is where most current members are starting and ending their trips.  Therefore, non-members with member-like riding patterns (for example, a non-member who often commutes to work using Nice Ride) will see the advertisements and may be more likely to sign up for memberships.  However, in order to truly evaluate what advertisements and which placements are the most effective, Nice Ride will want to run a controlled advertisement experiment.\n\nHope you found this interesting and useful!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

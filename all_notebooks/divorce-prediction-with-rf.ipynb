That is to say, for example, having a safe workplace might hamper demotivation, however adding more and more safety past a threshold will never make it a great place to work on its own.\n\nThe same could apply to relationships, the absense of divorce factors does not create a satisfying relationship on its own. For more information on such research, please refer to the video bellow.\n\nFinally we are drawing conclusions from a single type of relationship (marriage) and trying to extrapolate it to other kinds of relationships.\nIf in one hand marriages are more comprehensive than other forms of relationships and could therefore provide a better and more complete picture of what makes great relationships, it could also point to factors that may not be as relevant for other forms of relationships.\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Herzberg two factor theory of motivation\nYouTubeVideo('f-qbGAvR4EU', width=800, height=450)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Relationship Lessons"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This dataset is based on the research conducted by [Dr. Gottman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gottman) and the questions essentially distill his divorce predictors.\n\nThese divorce predictors are also known as the **four horsemen of apocalypse** as they are the major themes in the context of divorce.\nThe four horsemen are:\n- Criticism\n- Contempt\n- Defensiveness\n- Stonewalling\n\nThe video bellow gives a quick overview of these predictors."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Gottham four horsemen of apocalipse\nYouTubeVideo('1o30Ps-_8is', width=800, height=450)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is one thing to grasp the general concepts, but it is another to recognize them on a day to day basis.\n\nWe will start by interpreting the most important features (survey questions) on an individual basis and after that we will look into their associations, as in the complexity of a relationship it will be rare to find a scenario as simples as a single feature."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"explainer   = shap.TreeExplainer(rf_model)\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(raw_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Average feature contribution\nplt.title('Average Feature Contribution for each Class')\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values, raw_data, plot_type=\"bar\", plot_size = (15,10))\n\n# Keep top 20 most important feature indexes for later\nquestion_list = [17,19,5,20,18,40,39,9,25,11,15,27,38,26,4,3,41,36,14,22]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Granular feature contribution plot\nplt.title('Feature Contribution According to Value')\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values[0], raw_data, plot_size = (15,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How to read this plot\n> SHAP values make use of Shapley equations to frame the prediction as a cooperative game -

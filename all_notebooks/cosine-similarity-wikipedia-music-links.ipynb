Introduction\n\nOne of the best sources of the internet for textual information, Wikipedia has a lot of articles filled with details about thousands of musical acts. More importantly for this work, the Wikipedia articles of these artists often feature mentions to others. Take this example extracted from the Wikipedia page on Bob Dylan.\n\n_\"Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included **the Byrds**, **Sonny & Cher**, **the Hollies**, **Peter, Paul and Mary**, **the Association**, **Manfred Mann** and **the Turtles**.\"_\n\nIn just one sentence, we have references to seven other artists, and mentions such as those are spread throughout the article, showing acts who are somehow linked to Bob Dylan, whether they influenced him, were influenced by him, or something else entirely.\n\nGiven a dataset containing for each artist the number of references its Wikipedia article makes to other artists, this notebook plans to use that information to calculate the similarity between musical acts.\n\n## 2.

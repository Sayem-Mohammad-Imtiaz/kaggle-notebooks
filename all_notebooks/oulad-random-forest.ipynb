The model works decently well, with cross-validated acuracy of 80%. We would recommend future courses' instructors to run the model at around day 180, and reach out to students who are likely to fail. For the students who are predicted to pass, we recommend the instructor to do a sanity check by checking on students who score on average below a certain threshold. This threshold should be picked by the instructor based on past experience. We don't recommend any universal threshold: since every course has different structure, we would have to recommend a threshold so low it would be counterproductive. \n\nFor future version of this analysis, we would like to use the provided score data with more finesse than just averaging them together. We would also like to explore more into the misclassified students and see if we can maybe engineer more features that can help improve the current model. Finally, we want to rewrite our analysis with CatBoost so we can train faster on GPU.    ","metadata":{}}]}

If you come from a background in SQL and are familiar with GROUP BY,  you can scroll through this to see some examples of the syntax. *\n<br><br>\n\nGroupby is a pretty simple concept. You create a grouping of categories and apply a function to the categories. It's a simple concept but it's an extremely valuable technique that's widely used in data science. The value of groupby really comes from it's ability to aggregate data efficiently, both in performance and the amount code it takes. In real data science projects, you'll be dealing with large amounts of data and trying things over and over, so efficiency really becomes an important consideration. \n<br><br>\n\n# Understanding Groupby\nHere's a super simple dataframe to illustrate some examples.

We could apply other functions too. We could apply \"sum\" to add up all the weights, \"min\" to find the lowest, \"max\" to get the highest, or \"count\" just to get a count of each animal type. \n<br><br>\n\nThis is a short list of some aggregation functions that I find handy but it's definitely not a complete list of possible operations.\n<br>\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n    <td><b>Summary statistics</b></td>\n    <td><b>Numpy operations</b></td>\n    <td><b>More complex operations</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>mean</td>\n    <td>np.mean</td>\n    <td>.agg()</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>median</td>\n    <td>np.min</td>\n    <td>agg([\"mean\", \"median\"])</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>min</td>\n    <td>np.max</td>\n    <td>agg(custom_function())</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>max</td>\n    <td>np.sum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>sum</td>\n    <td>np.product</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>describe</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>count or size</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<br><br>\n\nThese two lines of code group the animals then apply the mean function to the weight column.\n```python\n# Group by animal category\nanimal_groups = df.groupby(\"animal\")\n# Apply mean function to wieght column\nanimal_groups['weight'].mean()\n```\n<br><br>\n\nHere's what happens when you run that code:\n\n\n### 1.

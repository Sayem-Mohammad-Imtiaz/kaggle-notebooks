Overview tab - This tab gives us a bird's eye view level of information about the dataset. \n#### What stood out?\nThe warning tab stood out to me where at a larger level there are insights about dataset's properties such as high cardinality in some columns or too many zeros that can act as a good indicator of the attention needed at the right place. \n\n### 2. Variables Tab - Contains drop down menus for each variable/column in the dataset along with important details like distribution, uniqueness, missing count, datatype etc.\n#### What stood out?\nIt is good to see that the variable with only 0's and 1's and the variables with Yes/No or even Y/N are treated as Boolean type even though there are other variables with only two categories but they are only marked as categorical in datatype (Gender and Education in this example). So the identification level is appreciable.\n\n### 3. Interactions Tab- Takes all continuous variables and shows in sub tabs the interactions among them.\n\n### 4. Correlations Tab - Takes all numeric variables and shows different sorts of correlations between them.\n\n### 5. Missing Tab - Shows different visualisations on missing count. \n#### What stood out?\nThe heatmap seems very useful in choosing to make certain types of imputations.\n\n### 6.

The association plot heatmap is highly intuitive, I really like how the size and shape of the filling for each correlation change as the level of correlation changes. This is quite different from the generic heatmaps we see.\n\nIn addition to showing the traditional numerical correlations, it unifies in a single graph both numerical correlation but also the uncertainty coefficient (for categorical-categorical) and correlation ratio (for categorical-numerical). Squares represent categorical-featured-related variables and circles represent numerical-numerical correlations.\n\nIMPORTANT: categorical-categorical associations (provided by the uncertainty coefficient) are ASSYMMETRICAL, meaning that each row represents how much the row title (on the left) gives information on each column."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1 Support Functions"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

Columns `id`, `white_id`, `black_id` are not important.\n\n2. Either column `created_at` or `last_move_at` must contain some errors. Per [description](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) provided by the uploader, `created_at` stands for the time when the game began, and `last_move_at` stands for the time when the game ended. Hence $($ `last_move_at` $-$ `created_at` $)$ must represent a duration of the game. But according to the dataset, for some games, the duration is $0$ (which, given the cirumstances, is not possible). For example, consider the game with `id` TZJHLljE (first row in the dataset). The value in the column `created_at` is 1.504210e+12. And the value in `last_move_at` is also 1.504210e+12. But then it follows that (1.504210e+12)-(1.504210e+12)=0, implying that the duration of the game is zero. But also note that according to the dataset, the game ended because either of two players ran out of time (the value in the column `victory_status` equals to \"outoftime\"), which clearly contradicts the fact that the duration of the game was 0 seconds (or whatever metric was used to calculate time).

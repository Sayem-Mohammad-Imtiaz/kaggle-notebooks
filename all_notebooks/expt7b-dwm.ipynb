Compute its neighborhood to determine if it’s a core point. If yes, start a cluster around this point. If no, label the point as an outlier.\n> ### Once we find a core point and thus a cluster, expand the cluster by adding all directly-reachable points to the cluster. Perform “neighborhood jumps” to find all density-reachable points and add them to the cluster. If an outlier is added, change that point’s status from outlier to border point.\n> ### Repeat these two steps until all points are either assigned to a cluster or designated as an outlier.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### For this experiment I am using this dataset. \n### https://www.kaggle.com/binovi/wholesale-customers-data-set","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/wholesale-customers-data-set/Wholesale customers data.csv\");\ndata1 = df\nprint(df.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Information about the features of the dataset is as follows:\n\n> ### FRESH: annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous);\n> ### MILK: annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous);\n> ### GROCERY: annual spending (m.u.)on grocery products (Continuous);\n> ### FROZEN: annual spending (m.u.)on frozen products (Continuous)\n> ### DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)\n> ### DELICATESSEN: annual spending (m.u.)on and delicatessen products (Continuous);\n> ### CHANNEL: customersâ€™ Channel - Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/CafÃ©) or Retail channel (Nominal) REGION","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.info())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.describe())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop([\"Channel\", \"Region\"], axis = 1, inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plotting the scatter plot","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = df['Grocery']\ny = df['Milk']\n\nplt.scatter(x,y)\nplt.xlabel(\"Groceries\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Milk\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df[[\"Grocery\", \"Milk\"]]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature Scaling","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stscaler = StandardScaler().fit(df)\ndf = stscaler.transform(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### DBSCAN Algorithm","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dbsc = DBSCAN(eps = .5, min_samples = 15).fit(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"labels = dbsc.labels_\ncore_samples = np.zeros_like(labels, dtype = bool)\ncore_samples[dbsc.core_sample_indices_] = True","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plotting the clusters","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\n\nfiltro=list(core_samples)\n\ndata1[\"Filtro\"]=filtro\n\nsns.lmplot(\"Grocery\",\"Milk\",data=data1,fit_reg=False,hue=\"Filtro\",size=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n> ### So,in this experiment we got to know about the prime disadvantages of centroid-based clustering and got familiar with another family of clustering techniques i.e. density-based clustering.

We don’t know exactly what our customers are looking for but based on a data set we can predict and recommend a relevant product to a specific customer. We can apply the DBSCAN to our data set (based on the e-commerce database) and find clusters based on the products that the users have bought. Using this clusters we can find similarities between customers, for example, if customer A has bought a pen, a book and one pair scissors, while customer B purchased a book and one pair of scissors, then you could recommend a pen to customer B.\n\n> ### Before the rise of deep learning based advanced methodologies, researchers used DBSCAN in order to segregate genes from a genes dataset that had the chance of mediating cancer.\n\n> ### Scientists have used DBSCAN in order to detect the stops in the trajectory data generated from mobile GPS devices.

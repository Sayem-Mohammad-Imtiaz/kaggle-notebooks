That means **a lot of the opening week/weekend data (a lot of movies release on Friday or Saturday) will not be in the dataset**. This is a major problem, as a large portion of the tickets sales happens in the opening week.\n\nTo demonstrate, let's check out this movie that were released on 2020/07/15. We only have one row of data, but you can see that `tickets != total_tickets` and `revenue != total_revenue`. That's because its sales data from 2020/07/15 to 2020/07/19 did not appear in the weekly data from 2020/07/13 to 2020/07/19.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df.name == \"屍速列車：感染半島\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here's another example.

Because most of these movies were release before the start of this dataset (Oct 2017), and we have no data on when the movie was re-released, we have no way to recover numbers for the opening week/weekend of the re-release.\n\nFollowing is an example of this situation. The `total_tickets` and `total_revenue` columns include all sales since 2016/11/25, and we have no way to recover the numbers for the opening week (possibly around 2020/05/01) of this re-release.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df.name == \"終極追殺令\"]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above example also highlights another problem of this dataset — **the `release_date` column is inconsistent!** This is really annoying.

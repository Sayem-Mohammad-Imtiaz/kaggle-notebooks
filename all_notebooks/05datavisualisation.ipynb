We will also explore Pandas's graphic backend [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) as well as introducing [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) to expand our visualisation capability. \n\nBefore we do that, it is also important to acknowledge that there are many different modules available in Python for Data Visualisaiton. This includes [plotly](https://plotly.com) and [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/). The latter also makes it very easy to put together an interactive webapplication for users to explore different scenarios. For some quick examples see [here]( https://chansta-statistics.herokuapp.com) for some demonstrations on using Bokeh to explore normal and t distributions as well as the concept of correlation. \n\nIt is also important to note that this notebook barely scratches the surface of the world on data visusalistion, statistical data or otherwise. The modules mentioned above will each contain further inforamtion on how to learn more about data visualisation. Please feel free to explore. \n\nThe list of topics inlcude in this notebook are\n\n1.

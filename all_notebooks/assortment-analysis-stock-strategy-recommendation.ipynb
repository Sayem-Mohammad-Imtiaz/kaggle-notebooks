It is a combination of two inventory analysis - ABC and XYZ. The goal is to shape sales strategy by product\n#### ABC classificates products by amount of profit or gross, i.e. shows what goods gives maximum cash. \n* #### group A - important products that should always be present in the assortment. this group includes the most profitable products.\n* #### Group B is of medium importance.\n* #### Group C - names of important products, these are applicants for exclusion from the range and new products.XYZ classificates products by \n#### XYZ-analysis is a tool that allows you to divide products according to the degree of stability in sales and the level of fluctuations in consumption.The method of this analysis consists in calculating each heading of the coefficient of variation or flow rate fluctuation. This coefficient shows the deviation of consumption from the average value and is expressed as a percentage. The result of the XYZ analysis is a grouping of goods into three categories, based on the stability of their behavior:\n* #### Category X These are goods characterized by a stable consumption value and a high degree of forecasting.\n* #### Category Y These are products with seasonal fluctuations and average forecasting capabilities.\n* #### Category Z These are goods with irregular consumption and unpredictable fluctuations, therefore, it is impossible to predict their demand.\n#### Result is a matrix which shows products and their categories, for each of what company shapes strategy","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data preparation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing librarires","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport copy\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport cufflinks\ncufflinks.go_offline()\ncufflinks.set_config_file(world_readable=True, theme='pearl', offline=True)\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading files","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"orderdetails = pd.read_csv('../input/ecommerce-data/Order Details.csv')\norderlist = pd.read_csv('../input/ecommerce-data/List of Orders.csv')\ntarget = pd.read_csv('../input/ecommerce-data/Sales target.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Looking at dataset with order details","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"orderdetails.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Checking null and missning values","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"orderdetails.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading some dataset descriptions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Orderdetails info')\nprint(orderdetails.info())\nprint('Orderdetails describe')\nprint(orderdetails.describe())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Looking at the dataset with orders","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"orderlist.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading some second dataset descriptions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Orderlist info')\nprint(orderlist.info())\nprint('Orderlist describe')\nprint(orderlist.describe())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Checking missing values in second dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"orderlist.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Creating heatmap of the dataset to check if there are 60 rows with empty sells or there are empty rows.

In order to ensure constant availability, company needs to increase the safety stock.\n* ### There are Bookcases, Accessories and Trousers in AZ cell.

An attempt to ensure the guaranteed availability for all goods of this group only at the expense of excess insurance stock will lead to the fact that the average stock of the company will increase significantly.

It means these goods do not bring much profit and do not have stable demand.The CZ group of goods includes all new goods, goods of spontaneous demand, delivered on order, etc. Some of these goods can be painlessly removed from the assortment, and the other part needs to be regularly monitored, since it is from the goods of this group that illiquid or hard-to-sell stocks arise from which the company suffers losses.

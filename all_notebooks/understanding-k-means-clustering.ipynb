Elbow method\n In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use. The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values for k  and then for each value of k computes an average score for all clusters. By default, the distortion score is computed, the sum of square distances from each point to its assigned center.When these overall metrics for each model are plotted, it is possible to visually determine the best value for k. If the line chart looks like an arm, then the “elbow” (the point of inflection on the curve) is the best value of k."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src = 'https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/numerical-computing-with/9781789953633/assets/f54e236e-f441-43d6-80a9-07feef4f6ef4.png'  >\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe elbow method helps to choose the optimum value of 'k' (number of clusters) by fitting the model with a range of values of 'k'.

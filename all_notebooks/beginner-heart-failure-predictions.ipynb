accuracy on the test set with the best model under the training set being the Random Forest with 94% accuracy\n- There is clear room for improvement if we can adjust hyperparameters using cross-validation (currently unsure of how to do this with current knowledge)\n    (Note to self: come back to this later and attempt to improve scores!)\n    \n- This concludes this notebook, feel free to give some feedback on improvements or any available to resources to learn from!\n- Up-vote if you think this is

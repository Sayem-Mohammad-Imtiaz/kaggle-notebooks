Due to the advent of machine learning, energy forecasting techniques have improved significantly, but is also in dire need of wide-spread implementation.  Forecasted load and price data, as well as actual price data from a four year period between 2015 and 2018 was gathered by fellow Kaggle user [Nicholas Jhana](https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather), which was collected from ENTSOE (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) and the Spanish TSO Red Electric España. The goal of this project is to improve upon the day-ahead electicity pricing using multiple linear regression.\n\nResults shown below, using squared mean error as the method of comparison.\n\n* Multiple Linear Regression: 9.51\n* Electric Company Error: 13.44\n\nThe results show that a simple multiple linear regression using the predictions from the Spanish TSO, and forecasted load data greatly improved the predictions of electricity prices in Spain."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem Statement\n\nDoes the current TSO in Spain accurately predict electricity prices?

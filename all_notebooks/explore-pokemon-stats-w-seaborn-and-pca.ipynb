I have credited the original dataset contributer at Reference section.\n\n# Summary\nWe started with a dataset containing 800 Pokemon game stats and a categorical variable \"Type\", aiming to visualize the distribution of Pokemon as well as explaining how those of the same \"Type\" are grouped together. Initial dataframe was treated with a column change - \"Type 2\" had nearly half the values missing, thus it was replaced with binary 0/1, for data analysis.\n\n\nInitial data exploration shows that the distribution of types is binomial, which coincides with the distribution of the overall strength of 800 pokemons, measured by the sum of all stats (attack, defense, sp. atk, sp. def and speed). Each stat by itself shows a right-skewed normal distribution, leaving some outliers that are possibly game specials - \"legendary pokemons\". Having a secondary type present shows a lift in overall strength by 10.8%.\n\n\nTo further examine whether, and if so, which attributes might explain the type, we reduced dimensions using PCA and plotted 18 types on a 2D graph. Although the two principal components are hard to intepret, we were able to cover 74.5% of the variance. We further attempted using PCA to find a fit between features and target, by logistic regression model. The result was of low accurancy - only 20%.\n\nThis study shows that game design is sophisticated - when assigning attributes to certain characters, designers must think of whether each attribute fits the distribution, as well as overall strength within each group. Especially with special events, game companies often rewards players with special items and create special levels. These creations are the outliers in game data and must be treated with caution too."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\nIn game design we often encouter character/monster stats that are inconsistent across the game - players might experience an extremely difficult starting level, for example. Each character, move and monster has at least 6 attributes (defense, attack, agility etc.) so the question is how do we design such characters whose attributes and level (being strong or weak in the game) are aligned, while all of them come together form a distribution (perhaps a normal distribution) that fits the best for the game play? \n\nIn this study I will study a dataset of 800 pokemons (out of the 809 most-up-to-date number) to understand how game developers from Nintendo and Game Freak design these infamous creatures and balance their attributes out. For simplicity, I'm using a dataset of pokemons at their beginning level.

The AQI calculation uses 7 measures: PM2.5(Particulate Matter 2.5-micrometer), PM10, SO2, NOx, NH3, CO and O3(ozone).\n\n2. For PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx and NH3 the average value in last 24-hrs is used with the condition of having at least 16 values.\n\n3. For CO and O3 the maximum value in last 8-hrs is used.\n\n4. Each measure is converted into a Sub-Index based on pre-defined groups.\n\n5. Sometimes measures are not available due to lack of measuring or lack of required data points.\n\n6. Final AQI is the maximum Sub-Index with the condition that at least one of PM2 and PM10 should be available and at least three out of the seven should be available.\n\n### How is AQI calculated?\n1. The Sub-indices for individual pollutants at a monitoring location are calculated using its\n24-hourly average concentration value (8-hourly in case of CO and O3) and health\nbreakpoint concentration range. The worst sub-index is the AQI for that location.\n2. All the eight pollutants may not be monitored at all the locations. Overall AQI is\ncalculated only if data are available for minimum three pollutants out of which one should\nnecessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Else, data are considered insufficient for calculating\nAQI. Similarly, a minimum of 16 hoursâ€™ data is considered necessary for calculating subindex.\n3. The sub-indices for monitored pollutants are calculated and disseminated, even if data are\ninadequate for determining AQI. The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air\nquality status for that pollutant.\n4. The web-based system is designed to provide AQI on real time basis. It is an automated\nsystem that captures data from continuous monitoring stations without human\nintervention, and displays AQI based on running average values (e.g. AQI at 6am on a\nday will incorporate data from 6am on previous day to the current day).\n5. For manual monitoring stations, an AQI calculator is developed wherein data can be fed\nmanually to get AQI value. \n\nLet us take a look at the ranges of AQI.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XmnE0rT.png\" alt=\"\">\n\nNow we can proceed with our analysis.\n\n## Downloading the dataset and importing libraries to conduct analysis:\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"K5Nn_Be46iNb","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing necessary libraries to conduct our analysis\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom datetime import datetime\n# Ignore harmless warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nfrom IPython.display import HTML,display\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"MG8hBBUr6WAY","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Reading the dataset into object 'df' using pandas:\nimport datetime\ndf= pd.read_csv('../input/final-1/19-20_pred.csv',parse_dates=True)\n\nfor i in range(19542):\n    df['Date'][i] = datetime.datetime.strptime(df['Date'][i], \"%d-%m-%Y\").strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# df.drop(df[df['City'] =='Portland'].index, inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"lj4vUaqXv4r-"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory data analysis(EDA),Data Wrangling and Pre-processing:\nFirst, let us take a look at the first five rows of our dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"-a7N0Kwb9p75","outputId":"92ad59e5-d9ca-4254-cdfc-f5f74230158a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"DyJ9g-etU8l4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Right off we can notice there are many missing values which can lead to incorrect predictions and inference.\n\nTaking a deeper look we notice that only the Delhi dataset is complete for the AQI column with the rest of the cities with incomplete data.

And the lowest amount of pollution is around july-September after which there is a sharp increase. \nSimilarly, there is a decrease from January to July. This spike in the winters is due to a combination of factors. One point of note is that North Indian states have a higher increase of pollution.\n\nThe spike is due to factors including Winter aversion(explained after),valley affect(explained after), seasonal factors such as dust storms,  crop fires, burning of solid fuels for heating, and firecracker-related pollution during Diwali, stubble burning etc.\n\n\n### Winter Aversion:\nIn summer, air in the planetary boundary layer (the lowest part of the atmosphere) is warmer and lighter, and rises upwards more easily. This carries pollutants away from the ground and mixes them with cleaner air in the upper layers of the atmosphere in a process called â€˜vertical mixingâ€™.  \n\nDuring winters the planetary boundary layer is thinner as the cooler air near the earthâ€™s surface is dense. The cooler air is trapped under the warm air above that forms a kind of atmospheric â€˜lidâ€™. This phenomenon is called winter inversion. Since the vertical mixing of air happens only within this layer, the pollutants released lack enough space to disperse in the atmosphere.\nDuring summers, pollution levels decrease as the warmer air rises up freely, making the boundary layer thicker, and providing enough space for pollutants to disperse. The same thing happens during winter afternoons, when increased heat brings down pollution slightly.\n\nThe effects of inversion are stronger at night, which is why air quality levels drop overnight. This is also why experts ask people to refrain from early morning walks, as they could be exposed to much higher pollution levels at that time.\nIn cities closer to the coast, like Mumbai, the sea breeze and moisture help disperse pollution. However, the Indo-Gangetic plain, which includes Punjab, Delhi, UP, Bihar and West Bengal, is like a valley surrounded by the Himalayas and other mountain ranges. Polluted air settles in this land-locked valley and is unable to escape due to low wind speeds.\nIn major cities of this region, such as Delhi and Kanpur, high industrial and vehicular emissions coupled with biomass burning in surrounding areas cause more pollution that gets trapped due to this valley effect and inversion.\n\n Now that we have an explantion for the seasonal component as well as trend component let us try to predict future values of AQI based purely on previous values.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"8DRWvFF9XdyK"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Forecasting: \nWe will be using three methods for forecasting values of AQI for India, namely, RNN using LSTM\nIt is obviously overkill to be using these three methods however being new to time series I would personally like to explore all three options.

But over time, the schedules got more and more complicated, the meetings extended, the calls were out of hours. And the child wanted to eat, wanted attention and cried. The routine became exhausting. How would we lock ourselves up to work and leave our sons alone? Better thinking about the post-pandemic trajectory.\n\n It's frustrating because it was years of college, internship and work to grow and have a career, and women had to stop because they didn't feel supported, because they are mothers. It's not just the break in their careers that upsets, it's people's lack of empathy. It seems that we still live in the last century, having to give up work in favor of the child, the family.\n\nPrinting back in time is not mistaken. In some pandemic months, researchers point to a 30-year setback for female participation in an already unequal job market.\n\nWhen everything was “normal”, the responsibility for household chores and the care for the people in the house already fell more on women. The confinement only reinforced this burden. https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://revistapegn.globo.com/Dia-a-dia/noticia/2020/10/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Jobs or kids?

And, in an unprecedented way, they led to a situation in which the majority of Brazilian women aged 18 or over are out of the job market today.\n\nMany women lost their jobs because they were the majority in occupations most affected by the pandemic, such as domestic and personal care services. Others describe themselves as forced to give up their jobs due to the accumulation of tasks at work, at home and in the care of their children, who are not going to daycare or school.\n\nFor some women, it became a matter of losing sanity or job. It is not about their less commitment or ability, but about this division of labor between men and women in which they also bear the burden of invisible, unpaid work, and often not even considered work. https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://revistapegn.globo.com/Dia-a-dia/noticia/2020/10/na-pandemia-trabalhar-e-ser-mae-voltou-ser-um-dilema.html&prev=search&pto=aue"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadssubsaharancsv/subsaharan.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'subsaharan.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Blackout of female careers in the pandemic.\n\nIt is a recent phenomenon, difficult to measure, surrounded by taboos and prevalent among women of greater purchasing power or who can count on the home office or other income in the family.

Many of the women who were forced to quit their jobs stayed at home depending on the government's financial assistance, because they had no one to leave their children with or because they would have to leave them alone to work, and still at risk of becoming infected - points out the Insper researcher.\n\nA recent study by the Institute for Applied Economic Research (Ipea) gives a dimension of the challenge.\nThe drop in participation in the labor market affected men and women in the pandemic, but it was more intense among them.

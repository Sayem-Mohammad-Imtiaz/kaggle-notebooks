The main aim of the Helsinki city bike system is to address the so-called last-mile problem present in all distribution networks. The city bikes were introduced in 2016 as a pilot project with only 46 bike stations available in Helsinki. After becoming popular among the citizens, Helsinki city decided to gradually expand the bike network. In the period between 2017 and 2019, approximately one hundred stations were being added to the network each year. By 2019 the bike network reached its complete state with only 7 stations being added in 2020. As of 2020, there were 3,510 bikes and 350 stations operating in Helsinki and Espoo.\n\n>Since 2016 more than 10.000.000 rides have been made. The total distance of the trips is 25.291.523 kilometres. To put that in perspective 25.3 million kilometres is 65 times the distance to the moon. The total time all residents spent riding the bikes is approximately 280 Years and 4 months.\n\nIn order to use the city bikes, citizens purchase access for a day, week or the entire cycling season that lasts from April to November. All passes include an unlimited number of 30-minute bike rides. For an extra fee of 1€/hour, you can use the bike for longer. Bikes are picked up and returned to stations that are located all around Helsinki and Espoo.\n\n\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"papermill":{"duration":0.028128,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:10:06.521469","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:10:06.493341","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import datetime\nimport calendar\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.cm as cm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap, LinearSegmentedColormap\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nimport networkx as nx\nimport community as community_louvain\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\nimport folium\nfrom folium import plugins\n\n# Custom Colors\nMAGENTA = \"#6C3483\"\nGREEN = \"#239B56\"\nBLUE = \"#5DADE2\"\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Custom Colors\nMAGENTA = \"#6C3483\"\nGREEN = \"#239B56\"\nBLUE = \"#5DADE2\"","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","papermill":{"duration":1.820383,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:10:08.369043","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:10:06.54866","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dataframe = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/helsinki-city-bikes/database.csv\", low_memory=False)\ndataframe.head()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"papermill":{"duration":70.755048,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:11:19.152906","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:10:08.397858","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Data type conversion","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.027495,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:11:19.208119","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:11:19.180624","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert timestamp to datetime64[ns]\ndataframe[['departure','return']] =  dataframe[['departure','return']].apply(pd.to_datetime, format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f')\ndataframe.dropna(inplace=True)\ndataframe.info()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"papermill":{"duration":16.621815,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:11:35.857626","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:11:19.235811","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparation\n## Rename Columns\nIt is considered best practice to store measurements units in the column names when sharing the dataset.

In cases like this, the context of the data can help to filter out the anomalies.\n### Allowed Distance range\nObviously, the distance cannot be negative in the Euclidean space. However, filtering only positive values is not enough either. To filter out all odd cases it is best to remove any trip that is less than 50 meters. The stations are always positioned more than 50 meters away therefore if the trip is less than 50 meters it is an irregularity within the context of this EDA.\n\n### Allowed Duration range\nDetermining the allowed upper and lower limits is very case-specific. However, the maximum rental time for a bike is 5 hours. Users that exceed 5 hours should pay an 80€ penalty. The 5-hour mark(18000 seconds) can be used as an upper limit for the trip's duration.\nThe lower limit is pretty simple to determine based on previously defined limits.\n50m distance limit/ 25km/h average speed.\n\n### Allowed Temperature range\nAs we can see from the table above the only anomaly for temperature is that it reached  32 degrees in Helsinki.

The graph below illustrates bike usage patterns for the past three years.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.04355,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:09.128065","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:09.084515","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def yearlyHeatmap(dataframe):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function plots the number of trips by weekday and hour of the day.\n    \"\"\"\n    weekdays = [\"Mon\", \"Tue\",\"Wed\", \"Thu\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"]\n    \n    # Data\n    df = dataframe.copy()\n\n    df[\"hour\"] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['departure']).hour\n    df[\"weekday\"] = pd.DatetimeIndex(df['departure']).weekday\n\n    df_2018 = df[df['departure'].dt.year == 2018]\n    df_2019 = df[df['departure'].dt.year == 2019]\n    df_2020 = df[df['departure'].dt.year == 2020]\n\n    daily_activity_2018 = df_2018.groupby(by=['weekday','hour']).count()['departure_name'].unstack()\n    daily_activity_2019 = df_2019.groupby(by=['weekday','hour']).count()['departure_name'].unstack()\n    daily_activity_2020 = df_2020.groupby(by=['weekday','hour']).count()['departure_name'].unstack()\n\n    # Figure\n    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1, 3,figsize=(60,15))\n\n    sns.heatmap(daily_activity_2018, ax=ax1, robust=True, vmin=0, vmax=70000, cmap=\"Blues\", yticklabels=weekdays)\n    sns.heatmap(daily_activity_2019, ax=ax2, robust=True, vmin=0, vmax=70000, cmap=\"Blues\", yticklabels=weekdays)\n    sns.heatmap(daily_activity_2020, ax=ax3, robust=True, vmin=0, vmax=70000, cmap=\"Blues\", yticklabels=weekdays)\n\n    # Labeling Axes\n    ax1.set_title(\"Usage patterns in 2018\", fontsize= 15, pad = 15)    \n    ax2.set_title(\"Usage patterns in 2019\", fontsize= 15, pad = 15)\n    ax3.set_title(\"Usage patterns in 2020\", fontsize= 15,pad = 15)\n\n    ax1.set(xlabel=\"Time of the day (Hours)\", ylabel=\"Day of the week\")\n    ax2.set(xlabel=\"Time of the day (Hours)\", ylabel=\"Day of the week\")\n    ax3.set(xlabel=\"Time of the day (Hours)\", ylabel=\"Day of the week\")\n\n    # Watermark\n    ax2.text(0.99, 0.01, '© Github/Geometrein',\n            verticalalignment='bottom',\n            horizontalalignment='right',\n            transform=ax2.transAxes,\n            color='grey',\n            fontsize=15,\n            alpha = 0.8)\n\n\nyearlyHeatmap(dataframe)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"papermill":{"duration":13.885266,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:23.052995","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:09.167729","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These graphs already illustrate that there is some difference in 2020 bike usage patterns.

In 2016 the station next to the Kamppi metro station(Central Helsinki) was the most popular one. However, since 2017 Itämerentori has become the undisputed champion by usage. Seeing Itämerentori and Töölönlahdenkatu as the most popular stations might be surprising, however, this popularity is explained by their location within the city bike network. While these stations are not in the centre of Helsinki they are grouped around the centre of the bike network. In 2016, when there were less than 50 stations, Kamppi was at the structural centre of the network. However, with the expansion of the network towards northern Helsinki the centre of the bike network moved north too. Because of this Itämerentori and Töölönlahdenkatu stations gained more \"important\" role within the whole network.\n\nOne boundary condition that can affect this list is bike availability in a given station. If there are no bikes available, then the dataset will not reflect the demand for bikes but rather their availability. What makes Itämerentori and Töölönlahdenkatu stations lively is that they are popular stations for both departures and returns. This ensures bike availability at all times and increases station usage.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.047548,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:33.142536","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:33.094988","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def heatMapPlot(dataframe, year = 2020):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints an interactive heatmap by destination locations for a given year.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data\n    df = dataframe.copy()\n    df = df[df['departure'].dt.year == year]\n\n    df.dropna(inplace=True)\n    df['freq'] = df.groupby('departure_name')['departure_name'].transform('count')\n    \n\n    # Map\n    hel_map = folium.Map([60.1975594, 24.9320720], zoom_start=12)\n    folium.TileLayer('cartodbdark_matter').add_to(hel_map)\n\n    stationArr = df[['departure_latitude', 'departure_longitude']].to_numpy()\n    hel_map.add_child(plugins.HeatMap(stationArr, radius=15))\n\n    display(hel_map)\n    \n# function call is commented for performance reasons\n#heatMapPlot(dataframe)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"papermill":{"duration":77.836574,"end_time":"2021-05-09T17:13:51.026153","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-05-09T17:12:33.189579","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another interesting observation is that the popularity of stations doesn't change substantially throughout the year.

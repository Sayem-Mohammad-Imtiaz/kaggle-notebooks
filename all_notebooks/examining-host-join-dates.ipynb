What's the trend like for people hosting AirBnBs in Boston? How much more popular is AirBnB among hosts now than it was two or three years ago?\n\n**Note**: This data is an incomplete record because it only includes hosts who are still active on the site and not historical hosts who have since taken their properties offline. Without the full historical record we're limited in what we can do! Furthermore, the size of the property sample is small relative to the timespan, so we don't have enough data to e.g. measure the impact of holidays on listings or what have you. It's important to understand not just what can do with data but also what you can't!"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"68eaee72-33c2-a1b8-3b76-f3c3f5395456"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\npd.set_option(\"max_columns\", None)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"71119927-d01a-f1b7-7592-7102b6ec5159"},"outputs":[],"source":"listings = pd.read_csv(\"../input/listings.csv\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8c3a45f3-688f-38c5-8f4a-4ea11850a578"},"outputs":[],"source":"listings.head()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0f5ed2e8-8372-5d4c-5aaf-92869e28afb4"},"outputs":[],"source":"join_dates = pd.to_datetime(listings['host_since']).value_counts().resample('D').mean().fillna(0)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7045cc0a-1964-5b41-7ab5-a8c0961c19ce"},"source":"Surprisingly, the statistical picture is dominated by a few rare events, times during which lots and lots of people signed up."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d20a3270-0c5c-62c7-be8e-c7c058d919f4"},"outputs":[],"source":"join_dates.plot()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4211079f-7247-560b-44f0-067fee8c006b"},"outputs":[],"source":"join_dates.value_counts()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"04c631b1-a8a7-9b7d-60c7-1fc474f244ec"},"outputs":[],"source":"np.argmax(join_dates)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f2157e63-b23f-7bcc-e942-412391492709"},"source":"Oftentimes when doing time-series analyses like this when something sticks out this strongly a quick news search brings up a culprit.\n\nUnfortunately in this case there's nothing interesting about this date in the news, at least not as far as I can tell.

The 2016 election result was astonishing as well as that of 2020, because, although Joe Biden was elected, it was still a very close race. \n\n### Goal:\nMy plan is to generate a graph that shows the percentage of people approving or disappoving Donald Trump chronologically from 2017 to 2020. I will be using the adjusted_approve and adjusted_disapprove data because the numbers are more accurate; they are weighted according to FiveThirtyEight's pollster ratings, which are based on pollstersâ€™ historical accuracy in forecasting elections since 1998.\n\n[Data Source](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read csv file and create a dataframe\ntrump = pd.read_csv('../input/trumpapprovalpoll/approval_polllist.csv')\ntrump.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Extract only the columns needed\ntrump[['enddate', 'pollster', 'adjusted_approve', 'adjusted_disapprove']].head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Create a new dataframe with only the relevant data\ntrumpsum = trump[['enddate', 'pollster', 'adjusted_approve', 'adjusted_disapprove']]\ntrumpsum.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Create a new dataframe with the data from Gallup only (to avoid having multiple data on the same data)\ngallup = trumpsum[trumpsum['pollster'] == 'Gallup']\ngallup.tail()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#delete duplicate dates\nnewgallup = gallup.drop_duplicates(subset = \"enddate\")\n\nnewgallup.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Convert 'enddate' column to a datetime object\nnewgallup['enddate'] = pd.to_datetime(newgallup['enddate'])\n\n#Sort dataframe based on the 'enddate' column in ascending order\nnewgallup.sort_values(by='enddate')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#pd.options.plotting.backend = \"plotly\"\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=newgallup['enddate'], y=newgallup['adjusted_approve'], mode='lines', name='approve'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=newgallup['enddate'], y=newgallup['adjusted_disapprove'], mode='lines', name='disapprove'))\n\n#fig = px.line(newgallup, x='enddate', y='adjusted_approve')\n#newgallup.plot(x=newgallup['enddate'], y=newgallup['adjusted_approve'])\nfig.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

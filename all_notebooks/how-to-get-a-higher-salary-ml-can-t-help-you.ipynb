{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nIt is extremely important to get as high a salary as possible right after college, to pay off loans or other immediate needs. However, getting a better salary is not as straightforward as getting placed (see my kernel for getting placed: https://www.kaggle.com/yushg123/eda-and-key-insights). Thus, we need to identify what you can do to get a higher salary. \n\nI will also be making a simple linear regression model and Random Forest using the insights found.\n\nSide Note: The models are not very predictive, meaning that finding the salary is not easy, and depends largely on factors not included in the data. My guess is that it is related to the extra-curricular work you do, so that you can show off your skills to the employer.\n\nThanks to Ben Roshan D for sharing this dataset. \n\nAlso, please upvote, as I am trying to advance on the tiers.

Bellabeat app, which provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits collected by 3 different kinds of smart wellness trackers: \n2. Leaf, the classic one that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip, \n3. Time, a wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology,and \n4. Spring, the water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology.\n5. Bellabeat membership, which gives 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n<br>\n\n### Current marketing strategy\nBellabeat invests in Traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. \n\nThe company invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter.

Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID or timestamp. Which can be divided into 3 groups: 1. data in minute-level ; 2. data in hour-level ; 3. merged summary data. For this analysis, merged summary data will be mainly applied with the support of data at minute/hour-level.\n\nWhile the dataset has a few problems that make the final insight may not be very accurate as the data is not up-to-date. First, there's a difference in data size (Nos. of observation: dailyactivity > sleepdata > weightinfo), the analysis in relationship on dailyactivity and weightinfo may lack data supported. Also, the data is collected by voluntary submission, a kind of survivorship bias may occur in the dataset since the better the data performed, the users are more willing to share out, vise versa. \n\nNeed to find how many users occured in all dataset.

Users tend to use smart devices on weekdays, especially on Wednesdays, but the total steps on Wednesdays are not the highest.\n\n2. There is a positive relationship between Total Distance and Calories Burned. \n\n3. Users tend to walk more on Saturday and less on Sunday, one of the possible reasons is that they hand out with friends on Saturday night, and get more rest on Sunday. Which also explains in the Sleep data.\n\n4. Almost 3/4 of the total time user spends is sedentary minutes, and Light Active minutes only got 22.3% of the total time of usage.

And I would recommend the brand add some new features as sending out encourage messages to its users and schedule planner on smart devices personalize on the users' data.\n\nFor example, the brand can send out these messages to its users on Wednesday, the day with the highest log-in with a lower work-out number as shown on the above graph. By doing this, it may help to enhance the customers' dependence on the brands, work out more, have more products with her journals. \n\nAnd with the help of the data, we can recognize that users are not likely to do exercise on weekends. Therefore we can train the machine on giving out a reasonable training schedule based on the user's data, like a light training on normal weekday, and end with a great one on Friday. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

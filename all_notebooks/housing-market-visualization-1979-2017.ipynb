For any given period this relationship is roughly linear with housing values predictably increasing with increasing median income. However, this relationship is constantly changing. For instance, in March 1979 the slope of the regression line was 2.9 meaning that median home values increased by 2.9 dollars for every dollar increase of median income between regions. In June of 2017 the slope of the regression line was 10.1 a three fold increase in slope. This implies that it is substantially more expensive to live in higher income area in 2017 than it was in 1979. During the height of the housing bubble the slope of the regression line increased to ~ 12. Perhaps the most salient feature of this dynamic plot is the visualization of the boom-bust cylce of the economy which appears as undulating expansions and contractions of the data points over time. For instance, we can visually assess three contractions one in the early 1980s ([Early 1980s Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession_in_the_United_States#1980)), one in the early 1990s ([Early 1990s Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession_in_the_United_States)) and one in the late 2000s ([Financial Crisis of 2007-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308)). The last of these is especially dramatic, which is not suprising since it corresponds to the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that while some regions change quite a bit over time in terms of median income and home values, other regions are fairly static. For instance, the point (in red) representing the US as a whole, doesn't move substantially from its starting point in 1979 to its end point in 2017."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

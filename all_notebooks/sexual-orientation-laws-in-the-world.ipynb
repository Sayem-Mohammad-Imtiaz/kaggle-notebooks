Such practices have been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades, but due to continuing discrimination and societal bias against LGBTQ people, some practitioners continue to conduct conversion therapy. Minors are especially vulnerable, and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness, and suicide.\"\n\n\"To date, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia, Vermont, Washington, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico all have laws or regulations protecting youth from this harmful practice. Eight of these state laws or regulations were enacted under Republican governors. A growing number of municipalities have also enacted similar protections, including at least 70 cities and counties in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.\"\n\n\"According to a recent report by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, an estimated 20,000 LGBTQ minors in states without protections will be subjected to conversion therapy by a licensed healthcare professional if state officials fail to act. In April 2018, national organizations representing millions of licensed medical and mental health care professionals, educators, and child welfare advocates declared their support for legislative protections against conversion therapy.\"\n\nhttps://www.hrc.org/resources/the-lies-and-dangers-of-reparative-therapy","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df=clean_headers(df)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-14T13:32:08.427259Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-14T13:32:08.427633Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-14T13:32:08.434429Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-14T13:32:08.427603Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-14T13:32:08.433523Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center

years.\"\n\n\"In Trinidad and Tobago, a court in 2018 ruled that laws banning gay sex were unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"But there are countries where existing laws outlawing homosexuality have been

ways</b></i></h1></center>\n\n\"The Supreme Court's LGBT employee protection ruling widened the definition of sex and provides more clarity. \nThe US Supreme Court decision barring workplace discrimination of gay or transgender employees is groundbreaking. By widening the definition of \"sex\" the court decided by a 6-3 majority that lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LBGT) people are also protected under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That federal law bans discrimination in employment based on race, religion, national origin or sex.\"\n\n\"Up until now many places had no such rules to safeguard LGBT employees. For those places that did, the new ruling replaced a patchwork of local and state ordinances to make sure everyone regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity is protected on the job. Perhaps surprisingly, two conservative justices, sided with the four liberal justices.\"\n\n\"Back in 2002 only 3% of Fortune 500 companies had gender identity protections in their nondiscrimination policies. Today, 91% do, according to the Corporate Equality Index 2020 published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) Foundation. Additionally, 65% now have transgender-inclusive health care coverage. That's a big increase from 0% in 2002.\"\n\n\"After the verdict was announced, Apple CEO Tim Cook, who is openly gay, wrote on Twitter, \"LGBTQ people deserve equal treatment in the workplace and throughout society, and today's decision further underlines that federal law protects their right to fairness.\" Nonetheless, leaders in business world who are openly LGBT are rare.\" June, 15,

Marriage</b></i></h1></center>\n\nBY JUSTIN MCCARTHY, JUNE 8, 2021\n\n\"WASHINGTON, D.C.  U.S. support for legal same-sex marriage continues to trend upward, now at 70%  a new high in Gallup's trend since 1996. This latest figure marks an increase of 10 percentage points since 2015, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that all states must recognize same-sex marriages.\"\n\n\"Republicans, who have consistently been the party group least in favor of same-sex marriage, show majority support in 2021 for the first time (55%). The latest increase in support among all Americans is driven largely by changes in Republicans' views.\"\n\n\"Democrats have consistently been among the biggest supporters of legal same-sex marriage. The current 83% among Democrats is on par with the level of support Gallup has recorded over the past few years. This could suggest that support for gay marriage has reached a ceiling for this group, at least for now. Meanwhile, support among political independents, now at 73%, is slightly higher than the 68% to 71% range recorded from 2017 to 2020.\"\n\nhttps://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx","metadata":{}}]}

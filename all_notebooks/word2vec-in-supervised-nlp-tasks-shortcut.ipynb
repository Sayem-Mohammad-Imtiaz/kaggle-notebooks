In other words, we assume that similar words have similar company like 'tell me who's your friend...'.\n\n\n**Why it's useful**\n\nWhen we have to use words in machine learning models, unless we are using tree based models, we need to convert the words into some kind of numeric representations.  The easiest way of doing this would be using some encoding methods of converting the word into a sparse matrix with only one non-zero element marking a corresponding word. Not even talking about the sparseness,   such aprroaches doens't give any information about local context of the words, it strips away information about words which commonly appear close together in sentences (or between sentences).\n\nSo, as a human-being, you understand that there's nothing more important for analyzing sequential text data than the context each word is used in. Keeping information about the context provides an opportunity to define sentimentally close words as generally similar instances which can be very important when it comes to analyzing text data.\n\n**How is it working**\n\nAn algorithm tries to refrlect the meaning of a word by analyzing its context. The algorithm exists in two flavors: ***CBOW*** and ***Skip-Gram***. In the second approach, looping over a corpus of sentences, model tries to use the current word to predict its neighbors, or in ***CBOW*** it tries to predict the current word with the help of each of the contexts. The limit on the number of words in each context is determined by a parameter called “window size”.\n\nBesides allowing for a numerical representation of textual data, the resulting embeddings also learn interesting relationships between words.\n\nPython word2vec implementation can be found as a part ***gensim*** package."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data prepocessing\n\nTo get better results you should fisrt clear your data.

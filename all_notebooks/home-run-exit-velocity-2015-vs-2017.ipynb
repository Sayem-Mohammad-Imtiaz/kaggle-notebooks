We've seen an incredible 6105 Home Runs in the 2017 regular season vs. 4909 Home Runs in 2015.  I compared the mean Ball Exit Velocities for the two populations using Python's ttest_ind() method.

You'll see that the Mean Exit Velocities, Standard Deviations, and Inter-Quartile Ranges are all very similar.  It appears at face value that the Balls are leaving the Bat at the same speed in 2015 & 2017.  So if the Balls are leaving with the same Force, then why are we getting more home runs in 2017?  Well I still have to do the analysis, but I'm thinking that its because the Pitching sucks.  Maybe a few too many balls are getting left out over the plate."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"acca3af96b3d81baeb21f5c6b3c5f373c234ceac","_cell_guid":"665ea800-038b-404e-9651-5cdcdf30109c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Descriptive Statistics 2015 & 2017 Home Runs:\n#### n, Average Exit Velocity (MPH), ..."},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"d07af8920e1106aa085de3cc0d8d80a72f82383e","_cell_guid":"9ed42df4-4496-4459-a5eb-840201ffbfd1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df15hr.describe()"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"37cdb6b9026bb83fbd04c12a17a03c6344e24228","_cell_guid":"c6149a03-64da-49e5-ab53-6ce4414b5707"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df17hr.describe()"}]}

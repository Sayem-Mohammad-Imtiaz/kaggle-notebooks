For example, the high profile Columbine high school massacre, which took place in 1999, was a highly planned attack that led to the death of 13 individuals while injuring 25 others. Last year, on October 1st, 2017, the perpetrator, Stephen Paddock, released gunfire at a concert in Las Vegas. The casualties included about 58 deaths, and over 500 injuries. The Las Vegas mass shooting is now known as the largest shooting in recent history. Therefore, because there is an upward trend in magnitude for each mass shooting along with other statistics which illustrate the magnitude of everyday gun violence, the statement that gun violence is decreasing seems questionable. Therefore, my partner and I are interested in digging deeper into the issue of gun violence in America to uncover some potential truths.\n\nThe significance of researching gun violence is that it can help shed some light on our pre-existing domain knowledge of gun violence in America. Apart from that, it can help determine other insightful information such as the highest percentage of gun violence based on location, collateral damage caused by gun violence, and many more. Currently, we hypothesize that gun violence is larger than it has ever been, and so, our goal is to really analyze that notion significantly. While performing our exploratory data analysis, we hope to get a broader understanding of the dynamics of gun violence in America and draw various staggering conclusions on the state of gun violence."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"94e9691c7b704882c6afd05c1fb8c9b91880db9b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='2'> 2.

However, once they were being used, the damage they cause could be pretty high. \n\nTherefore, it is reasonable for us to wonder why different types of guns caused different average loss.

above, it can be seen that even though the total amount of incidents involving each gun type can be different, the distribution of types of incidents they were involved are similar. The top five incidents type for these six types of guns are assault weapon, non-shooting incident, possession, raid/arrest and drug involvement. This may indicate that our deduction from the previous graph may be wrong -- guns like handgun are also likely to be invloved in irregular and dangerous incidents. Namely, the enormous damage handguns has caused are not only happened in situations like self defence but situations like drug involvement. Therefore, different types of gun do not have significant differences in terms of incidents they were invloved. Every type of guns could be used if the suspects intend to do harm regardless of the characteristics of the incident."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d3741672fd3933543641f83c396b25772bbd6b1a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='20'>9.

We base our analysis from the visualizations above. From the Incidents over Time visualization, we have observed that gun violence incidents have increased from 2014 to 2017. However, aside from the largest gun violence massacre in 2017, other gun violence fatalities have approximately the same number of injuries and deaths. In addition, from the time series plots, it is easy to observe that there are more injuries than deaths. This allows us to conclude that the incidents have increased, but the total damage has stayed nearly the same (apart from the Las Vegas shooting).\n\nFurthermore, additional gun violence demographics include that most victims and suspects are aged between 18 and 30, and most suspects are male. Additionally, the most common type of guns are handguns while the most dangerous guns are the AR-15 and the AK-47. However, the distribution of incident types for each gun is the relatively the same.\n\nFinally, while alarming, we found it very interesting that the District of Columbia has the highest number of gun violence incidents even though it is our capital, and it has some of the strictest gun laws in the nations. We also found it bizzare that in terms of states, Alaska had the highest number of gun violence incidents."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"487666b76456c642e9777d026c92a53450e15fb9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id='21'>10.

A good amount of our inspiration came from the Kaggle notebook Deep Exploration of Gun Violence in US created by Shivam Bansal. It was inevitable that we wo[](http://)uld come across the notebook while learning about the dataset. Also, we have referred other great kagglers' works to accomplish this project. Thanks for all of you.\n2. The folium map from above is completely from the Kaggle notebook, but we really liked the visualization. So, we adapted it, and included in our visualization.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A Chorus Line is a musical directed by Michael Bennett and co-choreographed by Bennett and Bob Avian, with music by Marvin Hamlisch, lyrics by Edward Kleban, and a book by James Kirkwood Jr. and Nicholas Dante. \n\nSet on the bare stage of a Broadway theater, the musical is centered around seventeen Broadway dancers auditioning for spots on a chorus line. A Chorus Line provides a glimpse into the personalities of the performers and the choreographer, as they describe the events that have shaped their lives and their decisions to become dancers.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe show opens in the middle of an audition for an upcoming Broadway production. The formidable director Zach and his assistant choreographer Larry put the dancers through their paces. Every dancer is desperate for work (\"I Hope I Get It\"). After the next round of cuts, 17 dancers remain. Zach tells them he is looking for a strong dancing chorus of four boys and four girls. He wants to learn more about them, and asks the dancers to introduce themselves. With reluctance, the dancers reveal their pasts. The stories generally progress chronologically from early life experiences through adulthood to the end of a career. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Chorus_Line"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/broadway-weekly-grosses/synopses.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(df, \n             x='show', y='synopsis', color_discrete_sequence=['#a142f5'],\n             title='On Broadway', text='synopsis')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.line(df, x=\"show\", y=\"synopsis\", color_discrete_sequence=['#a142f5'],\n              title=\"On Broadway\")\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cnt_srs = df['synopsis'].value_counts().head()\ntrace = go.Bar(\n    y=cnt_srs.index[::-1],\n    x=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n    orientation = 'h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color=cnt_srs.values[::-1],\n        colorscale = 'Purples',\n        reversescale = True\n    ),\n)\n\nlayout = dict(\n    title='On Broadway',\n    )\ndata = [trace]\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\npy.iplot(fig, filename=\"synopsis\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Writing a synopsis is almost to write a comment describing a Notebook."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.density_contour(df, x=\"show\", y=\"synopsis\", color_discrete_sequence=['purple'])\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.scatter(df.dropna(), x='show',y='synopsis', trendline=\"show\", color_discrete_sequence=['purple'])\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#\"One\" begins with an individual bow for each of the 19 characters (A Chorus Line), their hodgepodge rehearsal clothes replaced by identical #spangled `GOLD` costumes.

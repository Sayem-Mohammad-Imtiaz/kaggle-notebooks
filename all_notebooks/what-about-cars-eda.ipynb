We assume that the vendors are confident about the year of the cars they are selling. Consequently, we consider authentic the examples where the age of the car is bigger than $100$.\n2. We are not removing prices as ridiculous as $0$\\$ or $1$\\$.\n3. We are not removing car prices as big as $10e6$ and so on. Some true examples with these prices might exist.\n\nSome **conclusions** that can be drawn are:\n1. There are several cars whose price is near to 0 or 1, which might hint that some vendor wants to negotiate the price (perhaps). On the contrary, these examples might be simply incomplete. Additionally, some of these cars might be on the market just for spare parts.\n2. The newer the car (year 0 and nearby), the wider its price range is. For example, with cars whose year is set to be 2019 we have prices in the range $[10, 500000]$ \\$, with even bigger prices that we will obviate in this analysis. This means that newer cars are offered at a lower starting prices than older ones.\n3. The previous conclusion does not hold for cars older than 20 years. For example, we observe that in spite of the outlier prices the price range goes from $[100, 100000]$, and keeps reducing for older cars. The limit example that could be considered without relying on outlier values could be around 90 year old cars, where the price range is $[5000, 50000]$.\n4. From the previous two conclusions we can also deduce that newer cars can be sold for a higher price than older cars. This makes sense since newer cars shouldn't suffer as much deterioration as older cars. On the contrary, some of the older cars might be considered collector pieces, an scenario where their price might fluctuate depending on how popular each car is.

Nissan and Honda seemed to arrive to the States in the 70s.\n* It is interesting to observe that for recent cars, lets say younger than 10 years, most of the manufacturers show a common top value around $10e5$, whereas some differences exist for the bottom prices. \n\nFrom these plots we design a new graph that shows the avarege and standard deviation of each of the manufacturers considering their prices and years.

This occurs since we required a minimum number of 5 samples to estimate the Z-score. In addition, some of the prices show a huge standard deviation value, which is caused because the number of samples if bigger than 5, but still small. This causes that the standard deviation gets severely affected when at least one of the values is truly big or small.\n\nAlthough this is not conclusive since we don't have enough data for some of the years, we observe that:\n* There seems to be a patternsuggesting that during the first 2-3 years the value of the car remains similar and relatively high. Then, its value decreases to a minimum.\n* In the particular case of **Ford**, we observe that from 20 to 40 years car prices remain minimum, and after 40 years they start increasing until they show similar values or even bigger than new Ford cars. Consequently, this plot would suggest that many Ford cars that are more than 40 years old are still very valued in the market (or at least they are as expensive as new Ford cars). **Chevrolet** cars show a similar trend.  Could we state that USA buyers love classic (maybe muscle) cars?\n* About **Toyota**, we observe that the oldest cars on sale were produced 40 years ago. However, the trend seems to be similar to the one of Ford and Chevrolet, although it stops earlier.\n* The other two Japanese manufactured cars, **Nissan** and **Honda**, seem too reach their minimum values after 20 years. There is no clear sign of revaluation in their plots. This also occurs for Ram, although it seems to be a younger company and its cars might revaluate similarly to Ford and Chevrolet.\n* About **Jeep**, **GMC** and **Dodge**, there is missing information about cars older than 40 years. I would not risk to say that Jeep classic cars show signs of revaluation, either for GMC. However, with the little information that we have about Dodge it seems that some cars produced 50 to 60 years ago are sold with prices similar to new models. \n\nWe cannot conclude if this trend on the prices will hold in the following, let's say, 50 years. However, what seems to occur is that classic Ford and Chevrolet cars are quite appreciated and valued by car owners in the USA.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='#section4'> </a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.

This means that newer cars are usually sold at a bigger price. Do not get confused by the conclusions of previous sections, where we studied the whole price ranges for each year. Here, the boxplots show the prices after computing the quantiles, which take into consideration the concentration of price values in different ranges: 25% on the bottom of the box and 75% on top. In addition, Z-score cleaning is not performed globally for all the regions, but individually for each region and age.\n* We observe that is common that for the 'young' box plots all the regions show a similar 0.25 quartile. On the contrary, the 0.75 quartile is clearly bigger for the USA cars, and is followed by the European cars. This would suggest that Asian cars are being sold for a slightly smaller price than cars from the other regions. This effect is not so noticeable for 'middle' aged cars."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

These schools present enhanced developmental opportunities for academically gifted students. However, admission to all but one of these schools is granted based on the results of a Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialized_High_Schools_Admissions_Test 'Wikipedia article'). The test has two general categories of student assessment:\n\n* English Language Arts and Literacy (ELA)\n* Mathematics\n\nDue to the fact that students must actively pursue admission themselves, the following situation could occur [[3]](http://www.passnyc.org/opportunity/ 'PASSNYC's webpage'):\n\n> \"First, a non-trivial share of high-achieving students does not sit for the SHSAT at all. This may reflect a lack of interest, a lack of resources for test preparation, or a poor understanding of their odds of admission.\"\n\nThat is, academically talented individuals may not have access to the informational, motivational or financial resources necessary to prepare and take the SHSAT. Furthermore, PASSNYC focuses on promoting diversity and encouraging students from areas that are historically underrepresented in SHSAT registration.\n\nTo achieve their goal, PASSNYC relies on publicly-available data in order to locate such areas as well as provide (through their partners) services such as [[4]](http://www.passnyc.org/our-partners 'PASSNYC's webpage'):\n\n* Test prep and tutoring\n* Afterschool programs and activities\n* Resources for parents\n* Community groups\n\n## Problem Statement\nWith this Kaggle challenge, the PASSNYC organization aims to improve its outreach services which in turn will enable more students to take the SHSAT. To that end, the requirements for this project are as follows:\n\n1. To identify publicly-available data sources containing predictors of outreach services necessity.\n2. To quantify the socio-economic challenges that students face at a granular level.\n3. To assist PASSNYC in identifying schools where minority as well as economically disadvantaged students would benefit from the outreach services.\n\n## Datasets and Input\nIn this analysis, we will utilize the following datasets:\n\n* PASSNYC's school explorer dataset. This dataset contains records on more than 1200 schools in New York. The records list information on:\n    * The schools average Math and ELA proficiencies\n    * Every school's corresponding ethnicity composition\n    * The school's economic need index\n    * Custom measures (e.g. trust percentage, economic need index, supportive environment percentage)\n* District 5 SHSAT registration data. This dataset is provided by the NYC Department of Education and informs about the SHSAT registration and participation  from 2013 to 2016 for the district of Central Harlem.\n* [NYC Crime Data](https://www.kaggle.com/adamschroeder/crimes-new-york-city#Population_by_Borough_NYC.csv 'Kaggle'). This dataset contains 1.05 million complaints with a crime date format of (month/day/year). The latest crime date for this dataset is from December 31, 2015. The dataset contains, in total, 468 thousand crimes reported throughout 2015.\n* [US Household Income Data](https://www.kaggle.com/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations 'Kaggle'). This dataset contains the mean income, median income, standard deviation of the income as well as detailed location features for more than 32 thousand locations in the US. For the state of New York, there are 2160 entries.\n* [NY Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/housing-new-york-units 'Kaggle'). The NY Housing dataset contains information about 2900 construction projects within 116 ZIP codes from New York having start date between January 2014 and April 2018. The dataset contains information about (not exhaustive list):\n    * Project start and completion dates\n    * Project location\n    * Construction type (new construction or preservation)\n    * Number of units (rental, low income, medium income, other income, ownership, number of bedrooms, etc.)\n* [NYC High School Directory](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-high-school-directory#2016-doe-high-school-directory.csv 'Kaggle'). This dataset contains the prospecti for 437 schools in New York City. Since this dataset contains information about the available bus and subway lines as means of transport to each school, an inference can be made on the transportation needs of the neighborhoods hosting each school.\n\n## Solution Statement\nIn order to address the requirements laid out in the [Problem Statement](#Problem-Statement) chapter, this project will:\n\n1. Demonstrate that there is a relationship between a school's Math and ELA proficiencies and the percentage of students taking the test out of all the students registering for the test. That is the willingness of students to sit the SHSAT is linked to their academic proficiency. The academic proficiency is in turn linked to the socio-economic environment of each school (neighborhood income, housing options, transportation infrastructure, safety and diversity).\n2. Import, prepare and refine public datasets that provide information about the above-mentioned socio-economic environments of each school in PASSNYC's school explorer dataset.\n3. Build a model that predicts a school's normalized academic proficiencies based on socio-economic factors derived from the public datasets.\n4. Provide visualization of the challenges schools face and next best action for each school in PASSNYC's school explorer dataset.\n\n## Benchmark Model\nSince the task in point 3 from the [Solution Statement](#Solution-Statement) is a regression task for the prediction of a normalized target variable ranging from 0 to 1, we will utilize 3 dummy predictors to evaluate the performance of our actual model against:\n\n* A dummy predictor that always predicts 0\n* A dummy predictor that always predicts 0.5\n* A dummy predictor that always predicts 1\n\nWe will evaluate these regressors to our actual candidate models based on the [Evaluation Metrics](#Evaluation-Metrics).\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\nWe will utilize the following evaluation metrics for our candidate models:\n\n* Mean squared error: $MSE(y, \\hat{y}) = \\frac{1}{n_{samples}}\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{samples} - 1}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n* R2 score: $R^2(y, \\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{samples} - 1}(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n_{samples} - 1}(y_i - \\bar{y}_i)^2}$\n* Explained variance score: $EV(y, \\hat{y}) = 1 - \\frac{Var\\{y - \\hat{y}\\}}{Var\\{y\\}}$\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"29b62072df3dca9a9650572bd0ba6c6a4562b17d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis\n## Identifying The Relationship Between SHSAT Registration And Taking\nWe will first import the `D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers` dataset.

Therefore we hypothesize that we could use the average Math and ELA proficiencies of the schools as proxies for the took pct registered ratio. Later on in the project, we can test whether the modeling results will explain the took pct registered ratio.**\n2. **There is a strong correlation between the average Math and ELA proficiency of a school in both datasets. This means that good school provide strong training in both subject areas and there could be very few if any exceptions where a school provides only good training in Math and not ELA. This means that we could use either of those characteristics in order to measure what percentage of students from a given school will take the SHSAT . Furthermore, we can find schools with lower Math proficiencies and identify the social issues they face. This will allow PASSNYC to provide the required outreach services and increase that school's percentage of students who sit the SHSAT test.**\n3. **There is a strong inverse correlation between the academic proficiencies and the economic need index in both datasets. This could indicate that better funding leads to better academic outcomes.**\n4. **There is an inverse correlation between the academic proficiencies and the diversity percentage in both datasets. This could mean that more ethnically-diverse schools could be located in neighborhoods facing more serious socio-economic issues than less diverse schools. This, in turn, translates to worse academic outcomes. Such issues could be related to: transportation, safety, income, housing, etc. We will investigate this relationship further on in the project in order to allow PASSNYC to better target such schools.**\n5. There is a correlation between the average Math proficiency and the type of schools. It seems like charter schools generally have higher proficiencies based on the D5 dataset. However, in the school explorer dataset, there is a weaker correlation between the math proficiency and charter schools, but a stronger inverse correlation with the community schools. We need to further investigate:\n    * Whether the community school inverse correlation is related to the social conditions of neighborhoods having community schools.\n    * Whether community schools are more present in certain neighborhoods than other.\n    * Whether the reduced correlation between math proficiency and charter schools is due to a low count of charter schools in the school explorer dataset.\n6. There is a correlation between the academic proficiencies and the following custom school measures in both datasets:\n    * Collaborative teachers\n    * Effective school leadership\n    * Strong family-community ties\n    * Supportive environment\n7. There is a correlation between the rigorous instruction percentage custom measure and the following custom measures:\n    * Collaborative teachers\n    * Supportive environment\n    * Effective school leadership\n    * Strong family-community ties\n8.

The dataset's key features are:\n\n* Offense code\n* Offense category (violation / misdemeanor / felony)\n* New York borough where the crime was committed\n* Precinct where the crime was committed\n* Latitude and longitude of the crime's location\n* Date the crime was committed on\n\nThere are two main issues with this dataset:\n\n* The date format is inconsistent throughout the dataset and a small percentage of the crimes have a missing date. To address this issue, we will create a date conversion function. The function will parse as dates all entries where the date is in the format month/day/year. Missing values and implicitly-missing values (e.g. '01/01/1007') will be discarded.\n* The most straightforward way to aggregate the crimes by location is by pivoting the sum of crimes around the precinct variable. This will group and sum all crimes by their precinct, however we need to find a way to map these precincts to their corresponding schools from the `school explorer` dataset. We can address this challenge by mapping the precincts to their corresponding ZIP codes and aggregating the crimes by ZIP code.

To this end, we will use k-fold cross validation. This is a technique where the data is split into k number of groups and the modeling process in done k number of times. The modeling process is repeated k number of times and every time a different group is used as the validation set. The final model is an average of all k folds.\n\nWe will use several different candidate models, pass them through a k-fold cross validation, evaluate their results through the selected evaluation metrics and compare their performance. We will then select the best model and use it to predict the Math proficiency of each school.\n\nSince the prediction is based on socio-economic indicators, the inverse result of the normalized prediction will be an indicator of the school's socio-economic needs. Let's explain this concept in greater detail. The purpose of PASSNYC is to increase the proportion of students that take the SHSAT out of all registered students. Since this proportion is strongly linked to the average academic proficiency of each school, the actual goal is then to increase that proficiency. PASSNYC has stated that their work consists of providing outreach services to schools, such as [[4]](http://www.passnyc.org/our-partners 'PASSNYC's webpage'):\n\n* Test prep and tutoring\n* Afterschool programs and activities\n* Resources for parents\n* Community groups\n\nThese services are indeed aimed at increasing the academic proficiency of the schools. Since we discovered that the academic proficiencies are actually linked to socio-economic issues, we can attempt to predict the Math or ELA proficiency of a given school based on such factors, namely the:\n\n* Mean income of the school's neighborhood\n* Percentage of rental units in the school's neighborhood\n* Percentage of felonies on the school's neighborhood\n* Transportation density of each school's surrounding area\n\nWe can also use the custom measures (e.g. supportive environment, rigorous instruction), the academic measures (e.g. chronically absent students percentage) and the social measures (e.g. ethnic diversity) already provided by PASSNYC. A model built on all of those features will predict the academic proficiency of school based on socio-economic input. If we norm this prediction to 1 (the values of the regressor will range from 0 to 1) and invert it (take 1 - predicted value), we will essentially get a socio-economic need in order to obtain the maximum academic proficiency. This in turn will allow us to split the schools by their socio-economic needs and assign them a recommended action. Such actions could be:\n\n| Socio-Economic Need Index Range | Color Code | Recommended Action  |\n|:-------------------- |:-------------- |:----------------------------------------- |\n| 0 - 20%                | Blue             | No outreach services are necessary. |\n| 20% - 40%           | Green          | No outreach services are necessary , but school should be monitored. |\n| 40% - 60%           | Yellow         | The school should be monitored and the need for outreach services should be investigated further. |\n| 60% - 80%           | Orange        | The school needs assistance. One type of outreach service is recommended (e.g. Test prep and tutoring). |\n| 80% - 100%         | Red              | The school needs assistance. Two or more types of outreach service are recommended (e.g. Test prep and tutoring and Afterschool programs and activities). |"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a3b9ef6ee303672709e212f475937ffc11ed4b02"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will now scale and normalize our selected predictive features as well as our target (the Average Math Proficiency).

The 'test prep and tutoring' program by PASSNYC has the potential to address this challenge.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe started our analysis with a simple issue: 'how can we increase the number of students taking the SHSAT'. In order to answer this question we had to find the relationship between the number of students taking the SHSAT, the number of students registering for the SHSAT and the characteristics of each school. We saw that high academic proficiency correlates strongly with the proportion of the students sitting the SHSAT. Therefore, we decided to find various socio-economic factors that can predict academic proficiency.\n\nWe imported four new datasets in order to enrich PASSNYC's school explorer with additional features. The new, public datasets that we imported were:\n\n* [NYC Crime Data](https://www.kaggle.com/adamschroeder/crimes-new-york-city#Population_by_Borough_NYC.csv 'Kaggle')\n* [US Household Income Data](https://www.kaggle.com/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations 'Kaggle')\n* [NY Housing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/housing-new-york-units 'Kaggle')\n* [NYC Highschool Directory](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-high-school-directory#2016-doe-high-school-directory.csv 'Kaggle')\n\nWe aggregated various features from the above-mentioned datasets either on ZIP code or individual school level. We imputed the rows where there was no match and enriched the school explorer dataset. We investigated the correlation between our new features and our target variables (the academic proficiencies). We then scaled and normalized the data.\n\nWe derived a model that predicts normalized and scaled academic outcomes based on various socio-economic factors. We called the inverse of this prediction: 'socio-economic index'. We split the socio-economic index into 5 equal intervals with recommended actions for each interval. We named these intervals: 'socio-economic labels'. We then validated the model's results against:\n\n* An independent source of school ranking (the [niche.com](https://www.niche.com/?ref=k12 'External website') website).\n* The geographical distribution of the socio-economic labels.\n* The dataset on district 5 (Central Harlem), provided by the Department of Education.\n\nFinally we investigated the relationship between the socioeconomic labels and multiple features from the enriched school explorer dataset. In conclusion, we found out that:\n\n* Socio-economic factors have a high influence on the academic outcomes of schools. This is observed in the following trends:\n    * More diverse schools are in higher need of outreach by PASSNYC. A substantial amount of those schools is located in diverse and simultaneously - low income neighborhoods. We can verify that by looking at the `Economic Need Index` variable broken down by socio-economic need label.\n    * The economic need index of each school is a clear indicator of how confident its students will be in sitting the SHSAT.\n    * The academic outcomes of schools are related to the income in the area where said schools are located. Low income communities are in need of more resources in order to achieve better academic outcomes. This is also evident from the distribution of the low income housing percentage by socio-economic need label.\n    * Communities require security in order to produce better academic outcomes as evident from the distribution of the percentage of felonies by socio-economic need label.\n* PASSNYC's outreach has the potential to positively-influence New York's school and improving their academic outcome. This can be achieved by:\n    * Reducing the number of chronically-absent students (e.g. by providing 'resources for parents') firmly places a school in the green and blue labels.\n    * Improving the school environment (as seen in the `Supportive Environment` distribution) leads to better academic outcomes. This is probably within the reach of the 'afterschool programs and activities' provided by PASSNYC.\n    * Increasing the intensity of school instruction (as seen in the `Rigorous Instruction` distribution) is linked to better academic outcomes. The 'test prep and tutoring' program by PASSNYC has the potential to address this challenge.\n\n# Improvement Suggestions\n\nGiven more time and resources, our work can be improved both by adding new datasets to our enriched school explorer and by deriving new features from our existing datasets. Some examples of new features are:\n\n* Create a function for calculating geographical radius - this will allow for even more granular approach (e.g. see crimes, houses, etc. within 1 mile radius of a given school).\n* Use natural language processing on the school prospecti in order to derive academic proficiencies. The highschool directory dataset had multiple text columns. The texts from the prospecti can be processed for certain phrases that could be predictors of the school's actual academic proficiency.\n\nSome examples of new datasets that could be utilized are:\n\n* [NYC Wifi Hotspot Locations](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-wi-fi-hotspot-locations 'Kaggle'). Wifi connectivity could be a good measure of social integration. This could set apart schools in neighborhood with poor internet connection and could indicate where additional resources are necessary.\n* [NYC Payroll Data](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/ny-citywide-payroll-data-fiscal-year 'Kaggle'). Similarly to the US household income data, this could give us a better estimate of the incomes in NYC.\n\nThank you for your attention!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"1a747b6ce0ec0e443789e035bb188fda2cef782a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Also, review data is a whole lot bigger than tweet data typically, yet the overall process took about the same amount of time between Keras and Spacy. \n\nAs for the overall data, the model handled the positive values a whole lot better than the others. This is likely due to the huge desparity between the number of positive reviews versus the number of the other labels, which I did point out might come into play earlier.

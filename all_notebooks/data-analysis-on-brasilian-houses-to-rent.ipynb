Multicollinearity is a statistical phenomenon in which two or more variables in a regression model are dependent upon the other in such a way that one can be linearly predicted from the other with a high degree of accuracy.\nIt can be a problem only in gradient based models for example we are doing a linear regression and most of independent variables have a correlation above .9 with each others the model will have hard time seting the coefficients since most variables are highly correlated and important to predict the target variable, it will skew the interpretation of the coefficients , some of the solutions are to just ignore it if your goal is to make predictions and you don’t need to understand the role of each independent variable, you can also perform dimentionality reduction or you can remove the variables that gives roughly the same amount of information (for example if you are trying to predict salary of a lawyer and you got age and years of experience as features they'll be highly correlated most of the time and have similaire information then go ahead and remove one of them).\nbest article I found that explaines Multicolinearity:

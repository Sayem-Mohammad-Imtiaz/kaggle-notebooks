Point Maps**: These maps are geographical maps with dots placed at specific spatial locations that represent data points .*Dot size, color, or shape *can be varied to add a layer of comparitive detail when you look at the map.\n\nPoint Maps use dots (points, markers) to demonstrate the existence of a subject or a feature. It's a lot like Bubble Maps (Proportional Symbol Maps), but the dots' sizes don't depend on their values, as there's no size setting. Usually the tooltips are formatted to show some information about points - so these maps are very useful and popular in census, tourism, health service and any other researches.Spreading points (or dots) across a Map is rather alike scatter (or marker) series. So, in AnyChart, this series in maps is of Marker type.\n\nNote that when you use this type to draw density maps they must be drawn on an equal area map projection. This is critical - using a map projection which does not preserve the size of areas will distort the perceived density of the dots.\n\nThere are two general types of Marker Maps: One-To-One and One-To-Many. One-To-One is a type where a marker stands for an only feature, event or any other subject. One-To-Many means that one marker describes several subjects or values. There is no difference in setting the data, this is just general information that doesn't affect the way of managing the data.\n\nHere is a basic sample of point map:\n\n <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cy0L1ZW.png\">\n \n There are **specific requirements** for generating points maps .They are as follows:\n    \n  - Precise x-,y- positions data for each observation\n  - A 'marker' parameter (instead of z-parameter)\n  - Data parameter:type='Scattergeo'\n  \n### Generating Point Maps","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fc5076bd3818cf548729e4e2a90bb5ef1b1fe158","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us use the dataset available at https://www.4shared.com/s/fjUlUogqqei for this map\n\nsnow= pd.read_csv('../input/snow-inventory/snow_inventory.csv')\n\nsnow.columns = ['stn_id','lat','long','elev','code']\n\nsnow.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3e1e563bcf0f1db9e892a101a93d62d11edaa069","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"snow.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"33e5d26ccb8541d3bb4cc803d7d421206b188c8b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us take a sample of the snow dataframe for our data visualisation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7a56d71528acfb779728402121e68b1504c7a631","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"snow_sample = snow.sample(n=400,random_state=25,axis=0)\nsnow_sample.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3ad4e138409cff683e3ce3555663d4615e177710","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data1 = [dict(type='scattergeo',lat = snow_sample['lat'],lon = snow_sample['long'],\n             marker = dict(size = 9, autocolorscale=False,colorscale = 'Viridis',\n            color = snow_sample['elev'], colorbar = dict(title='Elevation (m)')))]\n\n\nlayout1 = dict(title='NOAA Weather Snowfall Station Elevations',\n              geo = dict(scope='usa',projection = dict(type ='albers usa'),showland = True,\n                    landcolor=\"rgb(250,250,250)\",subunitcolor = \"rgb(217,217,217)\",\n                     countrycolor = \"rgb(217,217,217)\",countrywidth =0.5, subunitwidth=0.5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e573f495fc47c7aeaa21420ae539155fa988f733","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plotly.offline.iplot({\n    \"data\": data1,\n    \"layout\": layout1\n})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"dba8e9b9fcbe788f0cad7da47bb2a166dd6c110f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# If you like to this kernel greatly appreciate to UPVOTE .

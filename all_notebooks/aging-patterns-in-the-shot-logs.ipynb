I was wondering whether this trend of moving more towards the 3-points line came from the fact that Kobe got older and older, or simply because the game changed, pushing more players to throw from outside the arc (of course these scenarios are not mutually exclusive).\n\nSo do older players shoot from further away when the time variable is \"frozen\" (or controlled) and we only look ast one season? \n\nIt is worthwhile to mention that my analysis only takes into account guards. a. because Jobe was a guard. B. because forwards and centers barely throw from the 3 points line to begin with, which might make the analysis not as meaningful and more prone to noise. \n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/the-inevitable-aging-of-a-star"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"09b9f37d-9c9c-5d58-5a49-79430e08c288"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"42de8b43-ea3c-d164-2668-d5e268c3151c"},"outputs":[],"source":"players = pd.read_csv('../input/nba-players-stats-20142015/players_stats.csv')\nshots = pd.read_csv('../input/nba-shot-logs/shot_logs.csv')"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f882d024-86fd-a63a-181c-5a7f44d319f6"},"outputs":[],"source":"players['Name'] = players.Name.apply(lambda x: x.strip(',.').lower())\nplayers['Average_Dist'] = players.Name.apply(lambda x: np.mean(shots.SHOT_DIST[shots.player_name == x]))\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3747a28e-f5dc-8ee3-53a6-813b01595c73"},"outputs":[],"source":"age_df = pd.DataFrame()\nage_df['Age'] = np.unique(players.Age)\nage_df['Dist'] = age_df.Age.apply(lambda x: 0.304*np.mean(players.Average_Dist[(players.Age == x) & ((players.Pos == 'SG') | (players.Pos == 'PG'))]))\n\nage_df = age_df[~(age_df.Age == 36)]\nplt.plot(age_df.Age,age_df.Dist,'o')\nx = age_df['Age'][0:19]\ny = age_df['Dist'][0:19]\n\nfit = np.polyfit(x,y,1)\nfit_fn = np.poly1d(fit)\nplt.plot(x,fit_fn(x),'r')\n\nage_df = age_df[~(age_df.Age == 36)]\nx = age_df['Age'][0:18]\ny = age_df['Dist'][0:18]\n\nfit = np.polyfit(x,y,1)\nfit_fn = np.poly1d(fit)\nplt.plot(x,fit_fn(x),'r--')\n\n\nplt.legend(['Data','Fit','Excluding age 39'])\n\nplt.title('Average shot distance vs Age')\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Average Shot Distance [m]')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"841a41da-4d55-fd59-c8f7-ad3faf7fe1a6"},"source":"Similarly to Kobe's trend. with age, the average shot distance increases"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e0138a29-b8c5-2dd4-8501-d1ef590f8666"},"outputs":[],"source":"players['2PA'] = players.FGA - players['3PA']\nage_df['2PA'] = age_df.Age.apply(lambda x: np.sum(players['2PA'][players.Age == x]))\nage_df['3PA'] = age_df.Age.apply(lambda x: np.sum(players['3PA'][players.Age == x]))\n\nage_df['3P ratio'] = age_df['3PA']/(age_df['2PA'] + age_df['3PA'])\nage_df['2P ratio'] = 1 - age_df['3P ratio']\n\nage_df['2PA_guard'] = age_df.Age.apply(lambda x: np.sum(players['2PA'][(players.Age == x) & ((players.Pos == 'PS') | (players.Pos.values == 'SG'))]))\nage_df['3PA_guard'] = age_df.Age.apply(lambda x: np.sum(players['3PA'][(players.Age == x) & ((players.Pos == 'PS') | (players.Pos.values == 'SG'))]))\nage_df['3P ratio g'] = age_df['3PA_guard']/(age_df['2PA_guard'] + age_df['3PA_guard'])\nage_df['2P ratio g'] = 1 - age_df['3P ratio g']\n\nplt.bar(range(len(age_df['3P ratio g'])),age_df['2P ratio g'])\nplt.bar(range(len(age_df['3P ratio g'])),age_df['3P ratio g'],bottom = age_df['2P ratio g'])\nplt.xticks(range(18),np.arange(20,38,1))\nplt.xlabel('Age')\nplt.ylabel('Share of scoring attempts')\nplt.title('The share of 3 pointers goes up with age')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"75275115-35c5-0269-c1e8-d2283dd05a7b"},"source":"The older the player are, the bigger is the share of 3 pointers they shoot"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1c18c145-18c5-4e84-6bde-d56a61d61e70"},"outputs":[],"source":"shots['Player_Age'] = shots.player_name.apply(lambda x: players.Age[players.Name == x].values[0] if len(players.Age[players.Name == x].values)>0 else 0) \nshots['Pos'] = shots.player_name.apply(lambda x: players.Pos[players.Name == x].values[0] if len(players.Pos[players.Name == x].values)>0 else 0) "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"527921d0-1f88-da77-b540-e777ca4ff252"},"outputs":[],"source":"sns.distplot(shots.SHOT_DIST[(shots.Player_Age == 21) & ((shots.Pos == 'PS') | (shots.Pos.values == 'SG'))], bins = np.arange(1,30,1))\nsns.distplot(shots.SHOT_DIST[(shots.Player_Age == 37) & ((shots.Pos == 'PS') | (shots.Pos.values == 'SG'))], bins = np.arange(1,30,1))\n\nplt.legend(['Age 21','Age 37'])\nplt.title('Guards shooting distance distribution')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c8286896-8d52-88b6-9cc4-4b804b71f9e8"},"source":"The most common shot for a young player is near-the-basket, whereas the most common shot for a 37 y/o player is a 3-pointer.

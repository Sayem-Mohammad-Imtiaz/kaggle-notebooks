In this problem, we may throw from any position in the room but the probability of it is relative to the current distance from the bin and the direction in which the paper is thrown. Therefore the actions available are to throw the paper in any 360 degree direction or move to a new position to try and increase the probability that a throw made will go into the bin.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import time\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"878a0f6d4dfa728f1cdd13f8690d842195d6e728"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The optimal policy data shows the best action for each state and some states may have more than one optimal action.\n\nThe values of -1000 in the move_x, move_y and throw_dir_2 columns are placeholder values that mean the other action was taken.

For example, if we are south-west of the bin and throw 350 degrees, this would be the same as -10 degrees and would then relate to a bearing from the person to the bin less than 90 correctly.\n\n   - Then the euclidean distance is calculated followed by the max distance a person could be from the bin.\n\n   - We then calculate the bearing from the person to the bin following the previous figure and calcualte the score bounded within a +/- 45 degree window. Throws that are closest to the true bearing score higher whilst those further away score less, anything more than 45 degrees (or less than -45 degrees) are negative and then set to a zero probability. \n\n   - Lastly, the overall probability is related to both the distance and direction given the current position.

For example, if we are at the edge of the room, we cannot move beyong the boundary and this needs to be accounted for.

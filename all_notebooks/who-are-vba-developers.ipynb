This makes VBA the Most Dreaded Language for two years in a row.\n\nIn particular, I'm interested knowing about the following:\n\n1. Other than VBA, what languages have they worked with in the past year (`LanguageWorkedWith`)?\n1. What languages do they desire to work with next year (`LanguageDesireNextYear`)?\n1. How frequently do VBA developers learn a new language or framework (`NEWLearn`)?\n1. Primary operating system (`OpSys`)?\n1. What kind of developer are they (`DevType`)?\n1. How do they best describe themselves (`MainBranch`)?\n1. Where do they live (`Country`)?\n1. How do they describe their employment status (`Employment`)?\n1. How many years have they been coding in total (`YearsCode`)?\n1. What is their primary field of study (`UndergradMajor`)?\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import csv\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom collections import Counter","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"@dataclass\nclass Respondent():\n    \"\"\"dataclass for each respondent\"\"\"\n    language_workedwith: str\n    language_desirenextyear: str\n    new_learn: str\n    os_primary: str\n    dev_type: str\n    main_branch: str\n    country: str\n    employment_status: str\n    years_coding: str\n    undergrad_major: str","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"survey_results_public = '../input/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2020/developer_survey_2020/survey_results_public.csv'\nLANG = 'VBA'\n\nwith open(survey_results_public) as file:\n    results = csv.DictReader(file)\n    \n    VBA_Developers = [\n        Respondent(\n                    response['LanguageWorkedWith'],\n                    response['LanguageDesireNextYear'],\n                    response['NEWLearn'],\n                    response['OpSys'],\n                    response['DevType'],\n                    response['MainBranch'],\n                    response['Country'],\n                    response['Employment'],\n                    response['YearsCode'],\n                    response['UndergradMajor'],\n                )\n        for response in results\n        if LANG in response['LanguageWorkedWith']\n    ]\n    \ntotal_devs = len(VBA_Developers)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Q0: What percentage of VBA developers did not express interest in continuing with VBA?\n\nThis question is not listed above.\n\nThe purpose of this question is to whether or not the way we got the data from the CSV file is correct.

The second argument must be an iterable containing `Respondent` objects.\n- Function `print_counter_results()`: pass a `Counter` object as first argument; optional argument `top` limits printed results based on given integer. This function could definitely use some improvements especially with regards to `string` and `print`."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

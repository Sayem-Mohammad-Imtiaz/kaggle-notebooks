(https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices) If you find that there is any error here or anything that can be better explained, please feel free to comment. Otherwise, let me go ahead and get started. \n\n# The Data\n\nThe dataset pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. We will be using this dataset in order to predict what housing prices could be in the future. Obviously the data is outdated but it will be a good way to help learn machine learning. This is also included in Kaggle Machine Learning course which I highly recommend you check out. Here are some information on the dataset that we are given: \n\n1. **longitude**: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west\n\n2. **latitude**: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north\n\n3. **housingMedianAge**: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building\n\n4. **totalRooms**: Total number of rooms within a block\n\n5. **totalBedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms within a block\n\n6. **population**: Total number of people residing within a block\n\n7. **households**: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block\n\n8. **medianIncome**: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)\n\n9. **medianHouseValue**: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)\n\n10. **oceanProximity**: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Libraries \nLet's get started by importing the relevant packages.

SQL\n\nIn most of the cases Python outruns other languages in terms of usage, but its good to have variety in your arsenal so give a try to R as well. SQL will come into place when you have to deal with relational databases.\n\n7.3 Algorithms mostly used\n1. Regression/Logistic Regression\n2. Decision Trees\n3. Random Forest\n4. Neural Networks\n5.

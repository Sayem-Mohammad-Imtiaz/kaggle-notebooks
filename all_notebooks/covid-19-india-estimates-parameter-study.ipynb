In this study, we aim to arrive at a statistically reliable estimate of potential infection cases in India till lockdown by comparing the infection parameters and their dependence on temperature and relative humidity in other countries. The parameters obtained for 4 Indian states are used as an input in our agent based model to simulate the number of cases under lockdown and no-lockdown scenarios.\n\nThe first case of what has since been known as COVID-19 dates back to November 17th 2019 which was confirmed by December 7th. The disease caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is termed as COVID-19 which translates lucidly to coronavirus disease 2019. Initially it was limited to the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China. However lack of checks to prevent the spread of the disease through human to human transmission resulted in a worldwide pandemic. On March 29, 2020 the number of confirmed cases stands at 723328 (Microsoft Bing Covid Tracker, 6.30am GMT March 30, 2020) with the number of active cases standing at 537332 (74.29%), the number of recovered being 151991 (21.01%) and the number of deaths being 34005 (4.70%). In India, which is dubbed as the world’s largest democracy, the present count of confirmed cases stands at 1161 with 1031 active cases, 102 recoveries and 28 deaths. A previous study attempted to portray the behaviour of COVID-19 outbreak across different countries and compared India’s position with respect to other countries based on some growth parameters.\n\nThe first case of COVID 19 in India was registered on 30th January, 2020. Since then over 1000 active cases has been registered in the country. Trying to make projections for a country with a population of more than 130 crore is no mean task and we have to proceed with extreme caution while interpreting the low number of cases. One of the most effective ways of trying to stop the spread of COVID 19 is through proactive testing. However, India lags far behind the other countries when it comes to tests conducted per million people with the present number of tests carried out per million people standing at 19 (TOI). This might have contributed towards the slow growth rate of COVID 19 affected people in India as compared to other countries. According to a World Bank report, the number of hospital beds per thousand people in India stands at 0.7. In comparison, China has 4.2, France has 6.5, Germany has 8.3 and the world average is 2.7. If India goes through Stage III of the pandemic and enters Stage IV, then the sheer rise in the number of cases would be too difficult to control any more. There would be no clear endpoint for the pandemic anymore.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The government however has made several interventions since the beginning of March to fight against human transmission of the disease. \n\nIn this study, we have considered the time series data from CSSE COVID-19 Dataset for our analysis.

would have 69 cases out of 359 per sq. km, RJ would have 33 out of 200 cases per sq. km, KA would have 73 out of 319 cases per sq. km by 29th April while WB would have 1028 cases per sq. km by 16th May. We can clearly see that WB has far more cases per square kilometer and this can be attributed to the fact that the population density of WB is almost three times that of MH and KA and five times that of RJ.\nHowever, with a lockdown in place, the numbers would change drastically as MH would have 14 cases per sq. km, RJ would have 8 cases per sq. km and KA would have 15 cases per sq. km by 29th April while WB would have at a maximum of 143 cases per sq. km by 16th May.\nHowever, these estimates are achievable only when we go for a 50 day lockdown.**\n\n**It is to be noted that, in a lockdown case we are reducing the effective contact rate by 80 percent post 24th March, 2020 , assuming that there would be still some movement outside even after the lockdown announcement.\nTill lockdown, there may be 4 potentially COVID-19 infected persons per sq. km in WB, 3 in MH, 8 in RJ, and 9 in KA per sq. km. This roughly translates to 3 lakh people in total in WB, 18 lakh people in total in KA, 27 lakh people in total in RJ and 11 lakh people in total in KA.\n**\nHowever, we strongly suggest that these numbers are not absolutely accurate and we would urge the readers to focus more on the population per sq. km count, as population is not distributed evenly across a region. We also believe that addition of more parameters and introduction of more complexities would only bring these numbers down.\n\nAll the evidence from our calculations seems to justify the present lockdown in place by the Indian Government. However, the way it was enforced is where it falls short and can even be termed as draconian. Although the model we used is very primitive to say the least, our findings in spite of falling short of outrageous numbers by [other studies](https://cddep.org/covid-19/) (it must however be noted that IndiaSIM is one of the most advanced models out there) is much larger than the official reported cases so far. This can also be attributed to the extremely low testing rates in India (currently at a meagre 19 tests per million people). Without any vaccination in place, nearly all of us have a possibility to catch COVID-19 sooner or later just like pox/measles; COVID-19 is not as contagious as measles but potentially more dangerous. Since there is still a lack of evidence as to how the virus spreads through social contacts and how the latter varies with age [(Singh et.al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12055), it is therefore necessary to resolve both these aspects before proceeding further. We have also not been able to capture demographic movement across the country with a large percentage of the population falling prey to the unexpected lockdown and being stranded all across the country. We do not know yet what effect that could have, especially because social distancing is not on top of the priority list for the migrant labourers as they seek to find some form of transport to go back home. Moreover, there is also the matter of huge uncertainty in all the parameters used by us in making the calculations as this is still an evolving situation and we hope to collaborate with anyone having access to better and more evolved data sources. Our study can be found here.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python [default]","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

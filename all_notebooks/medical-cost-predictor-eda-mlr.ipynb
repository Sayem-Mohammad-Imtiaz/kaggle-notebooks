How do health insurance agencies determine medical charges for individuals? *Should we eat more or eat less? To smoke or not to smoke?* Haha, it's always been clear in the real world that smoking will definitely hike up the price, but let's take advantage of the variables in this amazing dataset and see if they affect medical charges or not. Once we find out a pattern or variables related to charges, we can then develop a machine learning model to predict anyone else's medical charge within the constraints of the data we have.

We conducted a study to answer the\nquestion: What was the impact of differing funding levels, class size and teacher salaries on 2017 school\noutcomes, measured by SAT scores and graduation rate, across ~ 250 high schools in Massachusetts,\nUSA, using a Kaggle dataset.\nInitial analysis using multilinear regression saw no impact of these factors on the overall school population.\nHowever the schools differed widely on situational factors like socio-demographics and urban density.\nRepeating the regression analysis at a segment level found that these factors had a much higher impact,\nand that the factors differed according to segment, for instance higher teachers’ salaries was important in\nwell-off areas, whereas a large number/variety of classes was important in disadvantaged areas.\nThe conclusions of the study have a number of qualifications, such as the strong collinearity between key\ndimensions.\n(I did this project for a Python course)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"063bafeac382b79c76472ce3d4e484edfe2d4728"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Motivation and research question\nGovernments, charities and society has the best education of its children as one of its primary\ngoals, and they make substantial investments in schools and teachers accordingly. Questions of\nevidence-based confirmation of the value of these investments on student outcomes, so that\nscarce money can be best directed, are becoming increasingly pressing. For instance, The Smith\nFamily, a prominent Australian education charity, has as one of its activities:\n“Research and evaluation helps us to measure the outcomes and assess the effectiveness of\nour support and programs. Evaluation and regular reporting also drive continual improvement\nacross the organisation.”\nOne common set of education investments are class size, student funding and teacher salaries. A\nbetter, evidence-based understanding of how much these factors affect student outcomes can\nassist administrators and charities like The Smith Family optimize their investments.\n\nThe question this analysis seeks to answer, at least for Massachusetts high schools, is  \"What was the impact of differing funding levels, class size and teacher salaries on\n2017 school outcomes, measured by SAT scores and graduation rate?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fcef31d66d3f628a3f710dad2ee4210d51c61d27"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I would like to acknowledge the kernel/report [‘Exploratory Analysis SAT scores in Public Highs chools](http://www.kaggle.com/lgl12b/improving-sat-scores-in-public-highschools) by Luis de Mola for inspiration"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"23c9ef3d96c1cc2b84a28432973d3c954a79a93f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport datetime as dt\nimport plotly.offline as py\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly import tools\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport utils\nfrom itertools import cycle, islice\nfrom pandas.tools.plotting import parallel_coordinates\nimport collections\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score\nfrom math import sqrt\n\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"53d80275db05d1644477fe7ed0d1ef362ad95fe8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"py.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3a1b5c23948e6376dddfcf1cc8f1833756d8790a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Read in MA town size data \ntown_size = pd.read_csv('../input/massachusetts-town-size-2010/MA_town_size.csv', sep=',')\n#remove NA columns, set column headers\ntown_size.drop(town_size.columns[0],axis=1,inplace=True)\ntown_size.drop(town_size.index[:5],axis=0,inplace=True)\ntown_size.columns = town_size.iloc[0]\ntown_size.drop(town_size.index[0],axis=0,inplace=True)\ntown_size.columns.values[1]='Pop_per_sqm'\n#convert object to integer\ntown_size['Pop_per_sqm']=town_size['Pop_per_sqm'].astype(int)\ntown_size.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0ee7e0c66f7329ecf31511e905ef169f63481906"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# A histogram showed that 1,000 per sqm was a good cutoff for urban/suburban\ntown_size['rural?']=(town_size['Pop_per_sqm']<1000).astype(int)\npercentage = town_size['rural?'].sum()/town_size['rural?'].count()\nprint(f'Percentage of towns classified as suburban or rural (i.e. not urban) {percentage:.0%}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"99bac20dfc32295225029b2fb4a7cce5806321ca"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read school data\nschoolDf = pd.read_csv('../input/massachusetts-public-schools-data/MA_Public_Schools_2017.csv', sep=',',header=0)\n# merge in town size flag\nschoolDf=pd.merge(schoolDf,town_size[['Community','rural?']], left_on=['Town'],right_on=['Community'],how='left')\n#select schools covering grades 9-12\nTypeOfSchool=('09,10,11,12')\nschoolDf['HigherEd?']=schoolDf['Grade'].str.contains(TypeOfSchool)\nno_high_schools = schoolDf['HigherEd?'].sum()\nprint(f'Number of schools covering grades 9-12 =  {no_high_schools}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d013ff855b9195065eaabb200b261d61eeb0d5f0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to provide structure to the analysis, we grouped the data into 3 categories:\n1.

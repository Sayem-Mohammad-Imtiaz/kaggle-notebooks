Poultry production has a few things that could explain this boom. When looking at animal production feed conversion ratio is an important metric. This is the amount of food needed to increase the animal's weight by one. so the lower the ratio the better the animal is at growing. Chickens have a [feed conversion ratio of 1.6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio#:~:text=In%20animal%20husbandry%2C%20feed%20conversion,feed%20into%20the%20desired%20output.&text=FCR%20is%20the%20mass%20of,mass%20of%20milk%20or%20meat). This paired with the resource requirements of the small animal make it perfect for large scale and local production. we also see a large growth in pigs which are considered to have a fair to good [conversion ratio of 3.8-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio#:~:text=In%20animal%20husbandry%2C%20feed%20conversion,feed%20into%20the%20desired%20output.&text=FCR%20is%20the%20mass%20of,mass%20of%20milk%20or%20meat). Pigs also can eat from an extremely wide variety of sources making them easier to raise. They have been called a living [garbage disposal](https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/08/27/dc-used-to-feed-its-trash-to-pigs-whyd-we-stop/).\n\nBut this data is hard to read with the aggregate groups like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) so let's separate these graphs.

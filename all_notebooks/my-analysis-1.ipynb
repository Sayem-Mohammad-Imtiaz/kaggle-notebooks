The aim is to determine whether there is a significance difference between Global scenario and Local scenario of COVID-19 cases or not. The comparison is done using Pie charts for active cases, recovered cases and deaths.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

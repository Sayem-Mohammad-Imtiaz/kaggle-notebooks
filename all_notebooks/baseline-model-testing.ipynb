You'll be able to apply what you learn to Kaggle competitions as well as building machine learning applications. Through hands-on exercises you will:\n\n* Develop a baseline model for comparing performance on models with more features\n* Encode categorical features so the model can make better use of the information\n* Generate new features to provide more information for the model\n* Select features to reduce overfitting and increase prediction speed\n\nIn the exercise, you will apply feature engineering techniques to data from the TalkingData AdTracking competition.\n\n<center><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/srKxEkD.png\" width=600px></a></center>\n\nThe goal of the competition is to predict if a user will download an app after clicking through an ad. For this course you will use a small sample of the data, dropping 99% of negative records (where the app wasn't downloaded) to make the target more balanced."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Kickstarter projects\n\nTo help you apply the techniques, you'll first see them applied using data from Kickstarter projects. The first few rows of the Kickstarter projects data looks like this:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nks = pd.read_csv('../input/kickstarter-projects/ks-projects-201801.csv',\n                 parse_dates=['deadline', 'launched'])\nks.head(10)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"What we can do here is predict if a Kickstarter project will succeed. We get the outcome from the `state` column. To predict the outcome we can use features such as category, currency, funding goal, country, and when it was launched. \n\n### Preparing target column\n\nFirst I'll look at project states and convert the column into something we can use as targets in a model."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"pd.unique(ks.state)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"We have six states, how many records of each?"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"ks.groupby('state')['ID'].count()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Data cleaning isn't the current focus, so we'll simplify this example by:\n\n- Dropping projects that are \"live\"\n- Counting \"successful\" states as `outcome = 1`\n- Combining every other state as `outcome = 0`"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# Drop live projects\nks = ks.query('state != \"live\"')\n\n# Add outcome column, \"successful\" == 1, others are 0\nks = ks.assign(outcome=(ks['state'] == 'successful').astype(int))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Converting timestamps\n\nI convert the `launched` feature into categorical features we can use in a model.

This is a tree-based model that typically provides the best performance, even compared to XGBoost. It's also relatively fast to train.

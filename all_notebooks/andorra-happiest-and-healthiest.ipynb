By Steve Morris\n\nAndorra has one of the longest life expectancies in the world (somewhere in the top 4, depending on which source you believe). It's also the 23rd richest country in the world, measured by per capita income – ahead of countries like Germany, France and the UK.\n\nFirstly, note that Andorra is one of the smallest countries in the world with almost no usable land and no natural resources of any kind. It’s just mountains. It doesn’t have enough agricultural land to feed its tiny population of just 86,000. It doesn’t even have an airport.\n\nYou might have thought that a lack of resources would be a problem, but no. By contrast with the Central African Republic with its diamonds, Niger with its reserves of oil, gold and uranium, and Afghanistan, which grows almost the entire world’s heroin crop, and which are three of the world’s poorest countries, Andorra has nothing that it can dig up, chop down or otherwise exploit. So lesson number one is that wealth isn’t something that nature provides. It’s something that people create for themselves, literally out of thin air.\n\nAndorra knows that it can’t grow its own food, generate its own electricity or defend its own borders from attack. So it doesn’t try to do any of those things. Instead it focuses on creating the wealth it needs to pay for everything it lacks.\n\nAndorra imposes few restrictions on immigration. That’s why the vast majority of the population are not Andorran citizens. Do these immigrants cause unemployment? No. Andorra has virtually no unemployment (0 per cent until the global financial crisis hit in 2008). Yes – zero percent.\n\nBecause the country needs to import so many goods, it imposes no import/export duties. It also imposes little or no taxes on its population and businesses, so people can just get on with working and creating employment. The population grew from 10,000 in the 1960s to 80,000 today – not through a high birth rate, but by creating jobs and allowing people to come and work in the country.https://blogbloggerbloggest.com/2013/08/29/why-is-andorra-rich","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Just Breathe, it's another day in the Mountains.\n\n![](https://jaserodley.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/living-in-the-mountains-of-andorra-768x768.jpg)\nhttps://jaserodley.com/living-in-andorra/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/AD/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Andorra = '../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/AD/Andorra-ca-result-3.txt'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text = open(Andorra, 'r',encoding='utf-8',\n                 errors='ignore').read()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#What do people in Andorra actually do?\n\nI hope that you’ll realize by now that what they do isn’t really very important.

is hard to decide which one of these 4 engines perform the best. Based on the mean alone, the genre-based engine produces the best results. It is also the engine with the fewest 0/18 results. By contrast the author-based performs the worst with the most 0/18 results, as can be seen clearly on the plot above.\n\nWhat we learn and know for sure after this is that Goodreads may not exactly use the kind of simple (or naive) recommendation system that we have here. There could be more sophisticated engine that they use or they could simply base their recommendations on users' history (i.e. if most people who like book A also like book B), or a combination of both.

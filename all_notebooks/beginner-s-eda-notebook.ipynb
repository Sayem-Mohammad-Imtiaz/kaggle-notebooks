She departed at 19.00 carrying 989 passengers and crew, as well as vehicles, and was due to dock at 09.30 the following morning, Tragically, the Estonia never arrived.\n\nAn official inquiry found that failure of the locks on the bow visor, which broke away under the punishing waves, caused water to flood the car deck and quickly capsize the ship. The report also noted a lack of action, delay in sounding the alarm, lack of guidance from the bridge and a failure to light distress flares.\n\n## How things went down that night?\n\n![Credit: Hamburg University of Technology](https://cdn.prod.www.spiegel.de/images/d0eed47d-0001-0005-0000-000001064832.gif)\n\nThe strong maneuver which was supposed to counteract, instead made the situation even worse leading to the eventual sinking of the ship.\nWinds and Waves also played their part.\n\n## Documentry on that Night\n\n[![Sinking of MS Estonia-Documentry](https://img.youtube.com/vi/eFDGL_ehpkI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFDGL_ehpkI \"Sinking of MS Estonia-Documentry\")\n\n(Clicking on Image opens the video on new tab)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<strong><span style=\"color:red\">If you like my work, please don't forget to upvote this notebook!</span></strong>\n\n<strong><span style=\"color:blue\"> If you don't, atleast leave a comment on what should I do to improve it!</span></strong>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install DABL (it's a secret tool that'll help us later ðŸ˜‰)\n! pip install -q dabl\n! pip install -q country_converter","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import some basic libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\n\nimport country_converter as coco\n\nimport dabl","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/passenger-list-for-the-estonia-ferry-disaster/estonia-passenger-list.csv\")\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop the PassengerId column, since it's not a usefull feature\ndata = data.drop(['PassengerId'], axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check Null values in the dataset\ndata.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Cool!

It is a good practice to use DA if you want to prevent overfitting, or the initial dataset is too small to train on, or even if you want to squeeze better performance from your model.\n\nLet’s make this clear, Data Augmentation is not only used to prevent overfitting. In general, having a large dataset is crucial for the performance of both ML and Deep Learning (DL) models. However, we can improve the performance of the model by augmenting the data we already have. It means that Data Augmentation is also good for enhancing the model’s performance.\n\nIn general, DA is frequently used when building a DL model. That is why throughout this article we will mostly talk about performing Data Augmentation with various DL frameworks. Still, you should keep in mind that you can augment the data for the ML problems as well.\n\nYou can augment:\n\n1.Audio\n2.Text\n3.Images\n4.Any other types of data\n\nWe will focus on image augmentations as those are the most popular ones. Nevertheless, augmenting other types of data is as efficient and easy. That is why it’s good to remember some common techniques which can be performed to augment the data.\n\n**Data Augmentation techniques**\n\nWe can apply various changes to the initial data. For example, for **images** we can use:\n\n1. Geometric transformations – you can randomly flip, crop, rotate or translate images, and that is just the tip of the iceberg\n2. Color space transformations – change RGB color channels, intensify any color\n3. Kernel filters – sharpen or blur an image \n4. Random Erasing – delete a part of the initial image\n5. Mixing images – basically, mix images with one another. Might be counterintuitive but it works\n\n\n**For text there are:**\n\n1. Word/sentence shuffling\n2. Word replacement – replace words with synonyms\n3. Syntax-tree manipulation – paraphrase the sentence to be grammatically correct using the same words\n   Other described in the article about Data Augmentation in NLP (https://neptune.ai/blog/data-augmentation-nlp)\n\nFor audio augmentation you can use:\n\n1. Noise injection\n2. Shifting\n3. Changing the speed of the tape\n4. And many more\n\nMoreover, the greatest advantage of the augmentation techniques is that you may use all of them at once. Thus, you may get plenty of unique samples of data from the initial one.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install sklearn","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:26.813119Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:26.81344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.001912Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:26.813408Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.000596Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.\nSource: Wikipedia","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport nlpaug.augmenter.char as nac\nimport nlpaug.augmenter.word as naw\nimport nlpaug.augmenter.sentence as nas\nimport nlpaug.flow as naf\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nfrom nlpaug.util import Action\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.003865Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.004314Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.011112Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.004265Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.010054Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading and showing initial data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tweet= pd.read_csv('../input/nlpgettingstarted/train.csv')\ntest=pd.read_csv('../input/nlpgettingstarted/test.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.012471Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.012801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.063769Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.01277Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.062826Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tweet","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.066065Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.066358Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.08526Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.06633Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.083818Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.087365Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.087809Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.106167Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.087774Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.105015Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tweet.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.108005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.108596Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.11926Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.108524Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.118085Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tweet=tweet.drop(['keyword','location'],axis=1)\nprint(tweet)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.120512Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.120876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.135795Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.120844Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.135031Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Class distribution","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's check class distribution.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"x=tweet.target.value_counts()\nsns.barplot(x.index,x)\nplt.gca().set_ylabel('samples')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.136862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.137301Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.278794Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.137267Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-02T18:35:34.277747Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the barplot we can see that there is class distribution!!!

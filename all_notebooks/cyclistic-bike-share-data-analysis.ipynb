This is also my first Data Analytics Project. I hope you like it!\n\n## Scenario\n\nI work as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-sharing company in Chicago. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders whereas customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Thus, the director of marketing believes that the future success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. \n\n## Business Task\n> **Analyzing Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and convert casual riders into annual members by checking how they use Cyclistic bikes differently.**\n\n## A description of the Data Sources\nThe Cyclistic historical bike trip datasets have been provided by Motivate International Inc. under the following [license.](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)\n\nThe datasets have been provided through a website link. They contain data about historical bike trips beginning from the year 2013 upto July 2021 in the city of Chicago. The datasets and tables have been organized either yearly, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly. Each table contains 13 fields which store data about each trip taken. \n\n**As per the project guidelines, all further analysis has been conducted on tables containing data for the period of 12 months (April 2020 - March 2021).**\n\nThe following issues were noticed after combining the required datasets into one table:\n* Date and time columns ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ and numeric columns ‘start_station_id’ and ‘end_station_id’ given in String formats. \n* Null or missing values spotted throughout the datasets.\n\n## Data Cleaning / Manipulation Procedure using **Python**\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing Pandas\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Merging 12 months (August 2020 -

Thus, providing Summer discounts on the annual membership rates may motivate Casual riders to purchase annual memberships during these months and boost conversions.\n   \n2. **Create holiday packages which incentivizes trips on weekends, or take place post 4pm (Happy Hours) or, go on for above 30 minutes.**\n\n   Objective - The above data shows that most Casual riders make bike-trips trips on weekdays (Saturday and Sunday), and most trips are made around 5pm throughout the week. Moreover, it also shows that trips made by casual riders tend to be 3 times longer than those made by Members. Thus, creating new holiday packages specifically for those Casual riders who usually head out for leisure trips during holidays or in the evenings or for longer periods of time may motivate them to purchase annual memberships for these packages.\n   \n3. **Target the above promotions mainly at stations which are a part of the most travelled routes for Casual riders.**  \n   \n   Objective - Based on the above data, the stations which are a part of the most popular routes used by Casual riders will tend to have the maximum amount of crowd containing Casual riders. Thus, this can lead to an increase in awareness amongst Casual riders which may prompt them to consider buying an annual membership.\n","metadata":{}}]}

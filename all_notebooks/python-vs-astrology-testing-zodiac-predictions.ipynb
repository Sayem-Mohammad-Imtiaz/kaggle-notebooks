Two men were discussing the matter and one of them mentioned that it is extremely hard to validate the astrological/zodiac/horoscope predictions as they're simply too \"broad\". It is also known as the so-called **[Barnum Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect)**. The phenomenon occurs when individuals believe that personality descriptions apply specifically to them, while the description can actually be applied to everyone. Seems quite relevant to astrology, doesn't it?)\n\n![](https://inspirationfeed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Astrology-Meme-40.jpg)\n\nSo the goal of that notebook is to try testing some of the astrology claims, practice some Python data exploration tools and of course have some fun!\n\n#### This notebook steps: \n\n* [Short astrology intro and my testing approach](#section-one)\n* [Dataset Review](#section-two)\n* [Divorces Data Exploration](#section-three)\n* [Zodiac Compatibity Testing](#section-four)\n* [Conclusion](#section-five)\n\n\n<a id=\"section-one\"></a>\n### Short astrology intro and my testing approach\n\n**[Astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology)** is a very old discipline that came to us from the 2nd millennium BC and it claims to divine information about human affairs by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects like planets, stars and etc.\nDespite the fact that our modern knowledge of celestial objects is quite advanced as what it was 3,000 years ago, many people still believe in it today.\n\nAstrologists state the existence of the “zodiac signs” like Aries, Taurus, and etc. These signs can be assigned to every person based on their birth date and can predict much about the innate character of that individual.\n\nAs mentioned, the problem is that zodiac/astrology predictions of a person are hard to test. However, we aren’t giving up yet and there is at least one astrological thing that can somehow be validated and it’s called a “zodiac signs compatibility”. Essentially it means that some couples have higher (“good fit”) and lower (“bad fit”) chances for success in their marriage/love relationships depending on the compatibility of each other’s zodiac signs. Well… I wish it did work with my wife)\n\n\nWhile it is hard to test the “good fit” of a couple, the “bad fit” — is much easier. We can perfectly determine a couple’s “bad fit” and usually it is called a… divorce) So the goal is to take a divorce dataset and see what is the distribution of “bad fit” and “good fit” compatibilities.\n\n***My central assumption is: if astrology does work, then we should see fewer “good fit” couples and more “bad” ones.***\n\n<a id=\"section-two\"></a>\n### Dataset review\n\nI found and uploaded to Kaggle [this interesting](https://www.kaggle.com/aagghh/divorcemarriage-dataset-with-birth-dates) dataset, which is the Mexican government [official](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/registro-civil) data for the number of divorces in the city of Xalapa, Mexico and it contains approx. 4,900 divorce records. \n\nThe beauty of this dataset is that along with the other interesting variables, it contains each partner's birth date, which is a very rare event for a public dataset. That way we can find out the partners' zodiac signs and see if they were a good or bad fit. \n\nGiven that astrology is calling objects like planets and stars, we assume that it works irrespective of any nationalities and world places. \n\nSo let's rock...\n\n<a id=\"section-three\"></a>\n### Divorces Data exploration\n\nInviting the old fellas:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-11-22T13:37:09.79793Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-11-22T13:37:09.797144Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-11-22T13:37:10.820828Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-11-22T13:37:10.820056Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.06384,"end_time":"2020-11-22T13:37:10.820955","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-22T13:37:09.757115","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import modules\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom scipy import stats\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#list all files under the input directory\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.029703,"end_time":"2020-11-22T13:37:10.88067","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-22T13:37:10.850967","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The original dataset has columns in Spanish.

Not only signs but also actual dates probably should be considered, the exact time the person was born, sex, year and etc.\n\n- Testing and the assumptions approach is completely incorrect (feel free to comment)\n\nAnyway hope you find the exercise entertaining and will be careful about the astrology predictions in your real-life affairs.

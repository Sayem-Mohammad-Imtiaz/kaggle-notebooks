The insights about player performance is derived considering all seasons wherever it was necessary. \n1. Rishab Pant has the highest run scoring Indian batsmen in the last 3 seasons combined. He is way ahead than Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as fas ar IPL is concerned in last 3 years.\n2. David Warner can be described as best batsman from last 3 seasons as he has staggering average of 51 from 26 IPL mathes he played in 2017 and 2019.\n3. Leg spinners have proved to be vital pick for franchises as the wicket-taking option apart from lead pacers.Leggies Rashid Khan, Imran Tahir and Yuzvendra Chahal have been in top form in last 3 years.\n4. MS Dhoni has affected most number of stumpings summing 38 and 98 catches making him best wicket-keeper of IPL. Not Suresh Raina but Dinesh Karthik has the record of having most number of catches in the IPL.\n5. Approximately 18% dip is observed in the runs scored just after the power-play overs. Royal Challengers Bangalore has highest run-rate in death-overs while Rajasthan royals have the least.Sunrishers Hyderabad has best run-rate in Powerplay in last 3 seasons while the champion team Mumbai Indians have the least strangely.\n6. S Dhawan has scored the most runs as an opener in power-play in last 3 seasons.Narine has the highest strike rate of 191 in powerplays in last three years. S Raina has scored 2966 runs in all editions of IPL in the middle overs from over 7 to over 15. He is followed by Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma as high run scorers in middle overs from all seasons of IPL.MS Dhoni has been the high run scorer in middle overs from last 3 editions of IPL. \n7. Krunal is highly effective in stopping the flow of runs as he has been having highest ratio of dot balls against CSK and took 6 wickets at economy of 7 in the 5 matches he has played against CSK.\n8. Seam bowlers should bowl outside off(third stumps) short ball moving inline with the body of Virat Kohli.This kind of ball troubles Virat Kohli as he edges or plays the shot earlier than required which in return goes up in the air and gets him caught out.Spin bowlers can too bowl a length-bowl at third stumps moving towards the stumps. He either tries to drive or block which increases his chances of getting caught in the 30 yard ring or else LBW if he misses the shot.\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"matches=pd.read_csv('../input/skillsay-ai-crickethon-dataset/matches.csv');\ndeliveries=pd.read_csv('../input/skillsay-ai-crickethon-dataset/deliveries.csv');\nkohli=pd.read_csv('../input/viratkohlidataset/ViratKohli

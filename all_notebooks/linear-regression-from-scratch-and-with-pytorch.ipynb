Check out the full series:*\n\n1. [PyTorch Basics: Tensors Operations](https://www.kaggle.com/erdemuysal/pytorch-tensor-operations-for-beginners)\n2. [Linear Regression from Scatch and with PyTorch using Gradient Descent](https://www.kaggle.com/erdemuysal/linear-regression-from-scratch-and-with-pytorch/notebook)\n\nContinuing where the [previous tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/erdemuysal/pytorch-tensor-operations-for-beginners) left off, we'll discuss one of the foundational  algorithms of machine learning in this post: *Linear regression*. We'll create a model that predicts crop yields for apples and oranges (*target variables*) by looking at the average temperature, rainfall and humidity (*input variables or features*) in a region. Our data is called California Housing Prices.\n\nIn a linear regression model, each target variable is estimated to be a weighted sum of the input variables, offset by some constant, known as a bias :\n```\nhouse_price  = w11 * location + w12 * number_of_rooms + w13 * square_feet + b1\n```\nVisually, it means that the house_price is a linear or planar function of location, number_of_rooms and square_feet:\n\nThe *learning* part of linear regression is to figure out a set of weights `w11, w12,... w23, b1 & b2` by looking at the training data, to make accurate predictions for new data (i.e. to predict the yields for apples and oranges in a new region using the average temperature, rainfall and humidity). This is done by adjusting the weights slightly many times to make better predictions, using an optimization technique called *gradient descent*.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports and Definitions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We begin by importing necessery libraries and frameworks:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uncomment the command below if Numpy or PyTorch is not installed\n# !conda install numpy pytorch cpuonly -c pytorch -y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torchvision\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset, random_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Hyperparameters\nsplit_rate = 0.2\nbatch_size = 64\nlearning_rate = 1e-4\n\n# Other constants\nDATA_FILENAME = 'housing.csv'\nTARGET_COLUMN = 'median_house_value'  # Target to predict","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preparation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us first load the dataset as Pandas data frame.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/california-housing-prices/housing.csv')\ndf.head()  # Print first 5 row of the data frame, 5 is default value but desired value can be passed as an argument","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns, len(df.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For appropriate predictions, we should remove some of the entries like infinite, nan and non-numerical values.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)  # Replace inf values with NaNs\ndf.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop NaN values from the dataframe","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The training data can be represented using two matrices: `inputs` and `targets`, each with one row per observation, and one column per variable.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inputs: (longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income)\n# Convert from Pandas dataframe to numpy arrays\ninputs = df.drop([TARGET_COLUMN, 'ocean_proximity'], axis=1).to_numpy()  # Drop TARGET_COLUMN since it is target, can not be used as input\ntargets = df[[TARGET_COLUMN]].to_numpy()                                 # Drop 'ocean_proximity' since it is not numerical value\ninputs.shape, targets.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"input_size = inputs.shape[1]  # 8\noutput_size = targets.shape[1]  # 1\ninput_size, output_size","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have separated the input and target variables, because we are going to operate on them separately.

In the context natural language, terms correspond to words or phrases. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear more often in longer documents than shorter ones. Thus, term frequency is often divided by the  the total number of terms in the document as a way of normalization. \n\n> TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).\n\n- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is a weight indicating how commonly a word is used. The more frequent its usage across documents, the lower its score. The lower the score, the less important the word becomes. For example, the word \"the\" appears in almost all English texts and would thus have a very low IDF score as it carries very little topic information. In contrast, if you take the word \"coffee\", while it is common, itâ€™s not used as widely as the word \"the\". Thus, \"coffee\" would have a higher IDF score than \"the\".\n\nThe TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Passive Agressive Classifier","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Passive-Aggressive algorithms are called so because :\n\n\n- Passive: If the prediction is correct, keep the model and do not make any changes. i.e., the data in the example is not enough to cause any changes in the model. \n- Aggressive: If the prediction is incorrect, make changes to the model. i.e., some change to the model may correct it.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###

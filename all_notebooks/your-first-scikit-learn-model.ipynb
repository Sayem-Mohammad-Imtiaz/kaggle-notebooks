A decision tree?  Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.\n* **Fit:** Capture patterns from provided data.

Select the target variable you want to predict. You can go back to the list of columns from your earlier commands to recall what it's called (*hint: you've already worked with this variable*). Save this to a new variable called `y`.\n2. Create a **list** of the names of the predictors we will use in the initial model.  Use just the following columns in the list (you can copy and paste the whole list to save some typing, though you'll still need to add quotes):\n    * LotArea\n    * YearBuilt\n    * 1stFlrSF\n    * 2ndFlrSF\n    * FullBath\n    * BedroomAbvGr\n    * TotRmsAbvGrd\n\n3. Using the list of variable names you just created, select a new DataFrame of the predictors data. Save this with the variable name `X`.\n4. Create a `DecisionTreeRegressorModel` and save it to a variable (with a name like my_model or iowa_model). Ensure you've done the relevant import so you can run this command.\n5. Fit the model you have created using the data in `X` and the target data you saved above.\n6. Make a few predictions with the model's `predict` command and print out the predictions.  \n\n\n---\n\n# Continue\n\nYou've built a decision tree model that can predict the prices of houses based on their characteristics.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Rohingya Refugee Crisis\n\nThe Rohingya people have faced decades of systematic discrimination, statelessness and targeted violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar. Such persecution has forced Rohingya women, girls, boys and men into Bangladesh for many years, with significant spikes following violent attacks in 1978, 1991-1992, and again in 2016. Yet it was August 2017 that triggered by far the largest and fastest refugee influx into Bangladesh. Since then, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya—including more than 400,000 children—have fled into Cox’s Bazar.\n\nIn Myanmar, entire villages were burned to the ground, families were separated and killed, and women and girls were gang raped. Most of the people who escaped were severely traumatized after witnessing unspeakable atrocities. These people found temporary shelter in refugee camps around Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, which is now home to the world’s largest refugee camp.\n\nAs of March 2019, over 909,000 stateless Rohingya refugees reside in Ukhiya and Teknaf Upazilas. The vast majority live in 34 extremely congested camps, including the largest single site, the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site, which is host to approximately 626,500 Rohingya refugees.\n\n A Joint Response Plan was launched in February 2019, requesting US$ 920.5 million to provide life-saving assistance to 1.2 million people, including Rohingya refugees who fled Myanmar to Bangladesh and local host communities. As of 17 April, the appeal is 17 per cent funded. The priority needs in the plan, which covers the January-December 2019 timeframe, include food, water and sanitation, shelter, and medical care. https://www.unocha.org/rohingya-refugee-crisis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/styles/infograph/public/images/2020/08/25/rohingya_issue_taking_toll_on_bangladesh.jpg?itok=AMdtXjCq&timestamp=1598294563)tbsnews.net"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadshostcsv/host.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'host.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Upazila\n\nUpazila (Bengali: উপজেলা, lit.

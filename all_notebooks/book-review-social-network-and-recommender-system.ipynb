Revised introduction of your problem"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The main problem we are solving is designing a recommendation system to both recommend good books that users may like and introduce friends to people with the same taste in books. This idea has been widely addressed before, for example, from YouTube, Facebook, and many other apps.  YouTube always guesses what customers like to watch and show those videos on users’ main page, and it also gives users an option to subscribe to a channel or a YouTuber that is related to the videos he or she recently watched. What we want to do is pretty similar to these platforms. Although recommendation methods exist in many prior works to help users make decisions like selecting movies, music, products and dishes, those systems are not always completely based on the preferences of users themselves. The preferences of other users and what is popular now have great impacts on the recommendation as well. Therefore, it is desirable for us  to have a method of recommending books to users based on the readers’ own preferences and more in a network relationship way. \n\nTo test our recommendation system, we will use the SVD algorithm of Surprise library to predict the user's rating of the movie as a baseline. Then, we will observe two indicators, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to evaluate our prediction results. We hope this research can help readers to find the books they like faster and encourage them to read more. Besides the convenience of the users, it will build connections between similar readers as well, providing a more active and sociable reading environment for users to share their opinions.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Review of the relevant prior work\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook, we are going to build a book review recommender system that uses book ratings to recommend similar books that a reader may like according to the books he/she has read on the platform before. There are many pieces of research that analyzed the recommendation systems used in many popular book retailing platforms online, such as Amazon.com or Douban (Leino & Räihä, 2007). Leino (2007) stated that the purpose of any recommender system is to direct the users to the items that best satisfy them, but he did not mention how to avoid users to be recommended with books they dislike. In another prior research,  the author had researched on the recommender systems of various online sales platform in India, where he stated that various techniques like Collaborative Filtering, Content-based, and Demographic have been adopted for the recommendation but there are several drawbacks causing these techniques to fail in providing effective recommendations (Chandak et al., 2015).   \n\nHowever, our book review recommender system is different from those as we use various attributes to control the contents that we are going to recommend, including user-based and item-based collaborative filtering as well as demographic and geographic recommendation techniques. Besides, we aim to emphasize the impact of negative ratings when making recommendations. In this way, we would improve the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of our system.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. Background and business inspirations"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The initial inspiration is that we are confused by some current book review recommender systems because sometimes they cannot understand what we like and dislike. In other words, when it recommends books that I dislike, it would not make sense to induce us to read more. Therefore, our aim is to build a hybrid recommender system that induces book readers to buy more books, in order to promote sales for online bookselling platforms. For example, as a very quick search of “apple” on amazon.com could lead to completely different outcomes. Therefore, what we are going to do is to predict what the users really want to find using collaborative filtering.  In addition, we would expect the recommendation system would bring convenience to the online book users, especially in China, many readers would read before they buy, so the referral from peers (including ratings, reviews etc.) would be of vital importance. Thus, the platforms could be more sociable using our recommender system."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4. Major Algorithms and methods\n\n4.1 k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm\n\nkNN algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. For both regression and classification purposes, kNN could help a lot in predicting the neighbors of the users conveniently because it does not need results to feed its learning process.\n\n4.2 Collaborative Filtering\n\nThe motivation for collaborative filtering comes from the idea that people often get the best recommendations from someone with tastes similar to themselves. Also, we would use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in our recommendation system to find the books that they did not give ratings, and then project them via SVD to predict their ratings to similar books. Besides, we will test whether our system is making sense by checking whether some of the recommendations are actually the books they gave high ratings.\n\n4.3 Affiliation Network\nAffiliation networks would help the recommender system focus on not only the actors in the social network but also the societies. It will focus on the subsets or groups of readers instead of the direct ties between them. In this project, we would draw an affiliation network graph to show an outline of the structure of the dataset we used.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5.

Retail Data Analysis\n    \n> ## 1.1 What Is Retail Data Analysis?\nRetail data analysis is an analysis of everything in your business, from sales and inventory to customer data. It enables businesses to effectively track customer actions, like their purchases and foot traffic in the store- whether done in person or online. Since the advent of e-commerce, retail business has changed a whole lot more, as are other types of businesses. Use of data to increase profits has been in high demands than ever before; retail stores, small and big, now keep every bit of data available to make their online presence even more valuable and to score new buyers, and retain their regulars. \n\n>Data is accessible at nearly every touchpoint that consumers and retailers interact nowadaysâ€”including both online and offline. As a result, Smal and Medium Business (SMB) retailers can use insight collected from data to prepare for future store planning needs, including marketing, employee management, inventory control and more. In fact, SMBs can be even more agile and nimble in rolling out their analytics efforts and react more quickly to leverage data into a competitive edge.\n>## 1.2 Problem Statement\n>Just like any other retail business fratenity, this superstore has tasked us with performing extensive data analysis to deliver or uncover hidden insights on how the company can increase its profits while minimizing the losses.\n>## 1.3 About The Dataset\n>The dataset we will use in this project can be found [here](https://data.world/stanke/sample-superstore-2018). We will dive deeper into the features involved in our data.\n>## 1.4 Experimental Design\n>We will use static data- dataset already available rather than real-time data from an IoT system.\n>## 1.5 Software tools & Hardware Requirements: \n>- Jupyter Notebook, \n>- Python3 Liraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [Matplotlib](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) \n>- Supervised Learning libraries such [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n  ... will be exploited for the development and experimentation of the project.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color=blue>2.

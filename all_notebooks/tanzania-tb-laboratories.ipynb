This makes Tanzania being among the 7 TB high burden countries which are on track to achieve the End TB 2020 Incidence milestones there has been a 19% reduction in TB mortality from 58/100,000 in 2014 to 40/100,000 in 2018.\n\nIn year 2018, a total of 75,845 cases of all forms were notified, which is an increase of 6,205 cases or 9% compared to the year 2017. New and relapse TB cases notified were 74,692 among them, 48% were bacteriological confirmed TB cases, 79% were pulmonary TB cases and children among the new and relapse cases were 14%. \n\n#Tuberculosis Notifications By Region\n\nDar es Salaam city has remained a major contributor of TB cases notification in Tanzania. Its contribution makes 20% of all cases notified in the country, a 1% decline as compared to year 2017. There was considerable regional variation as in the previous years with 50% of cases being contributed by 7 regions - Dar-es-Salaam, Mwanza, Arusha, Geita, Dodoma, Manyara and Mbeya.\n\n#Tuberculosis Notification Rate\n\nThe country TB notification rate has been increasing for the last four years: 2015 to 2018, but there is still variation among the regions. In 2018, sixteen regions including the islands of Unguja na Pemba have notification rate below the national average of 138 cases per 100,000 population. https://ntlp.go.tz/tuberculosis/tb-prevalence","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme launched to fight TB and Leprosy in Tanzania.\n\nThe NTLP was launched by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in 1977.

controversial \"end of the Covid-19 Pandemic\", 01 August 2020\n\nTanzania took a controversial and relaxed approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic and started reopening the country two months ago.\n\nPresident refusal to impose measures of confinement or social detachment and the decision to stop publishing the infection data, merited harsh criticism in the region and worried neighboring countries and the World Health Organization.\n\nAt the end of April, when the country recorded 480 cases and 16 deaths from Covid-19, Tanzania suspended the release of the data \"to prevent panic\", continued to function fully and encouraged the population to resort to traditional medicine and to pray . \n\nTanzania was declared free from coronavirus in June (by the President), thanking God and the citizens' prayers for the defeat of the disease.\n\nThe diplomatic discussion between Kenya and Tanzania broke out shortly after the start of the pandemic outbreak in East Africa, when Kenya blocked Tanzanian truck drivers from entering the country, fearing the spread of the disease.

local development partners in an effort to prevent and control TB and leprosy to the point that they are no longer a public health concern.\n\nTB has continued to be among the top ten causes of death and among admissions aged five years and above in the country, suggesting even a greater degree of urgency to fight the desease.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF TUBERCULOSIS IN TANZANIA\n\nIn 2018, a total of 75,845 cases of all forms were notified, which is an increase of 6,205 cases or 9% compared to the year 2017. New and relapse TB cases notified were 74,692 among them, 48% were bacteriological confirmed TB cases, 79% were pulmonary TB cases and children among the new and relapse cases were 14%. TB continues to be among the top ten killers, costing the lives of many women and children.\n\nTUBERCULOSIS IN CHILDREN\n\nThere has been a notable increase of proportion of children under the age 15 year being notified among new and relapse TB cases. In 2018, a total of 10,513 children were notified with TB which is 14% of all cases. Among children (under 15 years) notified: 5,986 (57%) were children under the age of 5, while 2,404 (23%) cases were children between age group of 5 -9 years and 2,123 (20%) were children in the age-group 10 – 14 years.\n\nLEPROSY IN TANZANIA\nFollowing a steady decline since 2002, leprosy prevalence stands at 43 cases per 100,000. However, some regions including Lindi and Morogoro are yet to reach elimination targets, with a prevalence rate of 1/10,000.https://ntlp.go.tz/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes by PAB97

The difference between countries, however, was not very stark so we did not explore in to it further.\n\nWe also noticed that out of all countries with active loans, Zimbabwe pays off the highest interest rate by a large margin. On further investigation, we found out that the reason behind this is that unlike other countries with active loans, all of loans Zimbabwe had were of loan type with relatively high interest rates. An important point to highlight here is that most of the countries had loans of FSL type for which the interest rate is shown as zero (0) in this dataset.\n\nOn further exploring the difference between pre-2000 and post-2000 loans, we found out that \"East Asia and Pacific\" and \"Africa\" are the only two regions that have taken lesser loan post-2000, compared to pre-2000. Other regions loaned higher total amounts post-2000. We also found out that average loan amounts increased drastically for all regions post-2000.

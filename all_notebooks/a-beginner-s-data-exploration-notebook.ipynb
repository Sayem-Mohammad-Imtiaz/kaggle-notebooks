Grade becomes the dependent column and number of hours studied becomes independent column.*    \n**Independent Columns:** *These are the columns that don't depend on anything else for the problem we are solving. Usually, there will be many columns that might depend on each other. We do Exploratory data Analysis and find correlating columns and only retain one of the column.

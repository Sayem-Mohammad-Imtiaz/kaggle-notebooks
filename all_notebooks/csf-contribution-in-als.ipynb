Defining novel functions for cerebrospinal fluid in ALS pathophysiology. acta neuropathol commun 8, 140 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-020-01018-0\n\n\"This perspective article therefore aims to assess the possibility of CSF contribution in ALS by considering various lines of evidence, including the abnormal composition of ALS-CSF, its toxicity and the evidence for impaired CSF dynamics in ALS patients. The authors also describe a potential role for CSF circulation in determining disease spread as well as the importance of CSF dynamics in ALS neurotherapeutics. They propose that a CSF model could potentially offer additional avenues to explore currently unexplained features of ALS, ultimately leading to new treatment options for people with ALS.\"\n\n\"Although much remains to be established about ALS pathophysiology, multiple mechanisms are implicated including proteostasis, glutamate excitotoxicity, dysregulation of RNA metabolism, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport and autophagy. Notwithstanding these advances in our mechanistic understanding of ALS, a number of key questions remain unanswered. These include the primary cause of the disease and the significance of ageing as a risk factor, as well as a male predilection.\"\n\nhttps://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-020-01018-0"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/clinical/Cerebrospinal_Fluid.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Factors affecting glymphatic function</span>**\n\nARTERIAL PULSATION\n\n\"Current evidence suggests that exchange between the cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid (CSF-ISF) is mainly driven by arterial pulsation.

Nevertheless, the exact mechanism by which ALS-CSF induces neuronal degeneration remains to be established, although processes such as excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction have been suggested.\"\n\n\"Accepting inherent limitations in patient studies, including sample heterogeneity, and that CSF concentration may not reflect cellular levels, these in vitro and in vivo studies nonetheless show that ALS-CSF is toxic to neurons and possesses pro-inflammatory properties .\"\n\n\"The in vivo finding of toxicity distant to the site of CSF injection also raises a potential role for CSF in disease spread, a possibility supported by recent findings demonstrating the onset of motor and cognitive decline, as well as TDP-43 proteinopathy, following ALS-CSF infusion in mice.\"\n\nhttps://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-020-01018-0"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"Visit_Name\"].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Altered CSF dynamics in ALS Patients</span>**\n\n\"Evidence for the disruption of CSF flow in ALS includes findings from a phase-contrast electrocardiography-triggered MRI study, which revealed different CSF dynamics in ALS patients, with a delay in CSF flow upon systole and a higher maximum velocity.\n\n\"Abnormal CSF dynamics in ALS patients is also supported by a more recent study demonstrating reduced CSF flow magnitude along with a greater pulse wave velocity, although the causes, as well as implications, of these findings remain to be established.\"\n\n\"Additionally, with human neuroimaging studies revealing changes in CSF dynamics with age and recent evidence also suggesting reduced glymphatic clearance in older individuals, a major proportion of ALS patients, given the late onset of ALS, likely experience altered CSF flow and impaired glymphatic function.\"\n\n\"Sleep, which plays an important role in glymphatic clearance, is also known to be disrupted in ALS patients, who often have apnoea, or sleep poorly, owing to muscle cramps and fasciculations. Although sleep has yet to be acknowledged as a risk factor for ALS, it remains strongly associated with disease severity. Poor sleep, coupled to the severely affected respiratory function in ALS patients, could therefore significantly impair CSF dynamics and therefore glymphatic clearance.\"\n\nhttps://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-020-01018-0"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"csfspeed\"].value_counts().plot.bar(title='Cerebrospinal Fluid Speed', color='red')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"#EC7063\">Cerebrospinal Fluid Velocity Wave Speed (VWS)</font>\n\nDOI: 10.1109/TBME.2008.2011647\n\n\"CSF VWS was estimated by using the time shift identified by the maximum velocity and maximum temporal velocity gradient during the cardiac cycle.

The authors therefore outline several key processes in ALS that might be impacted by a dysregulated glymphatic system.\"\n\n\"Whilst the cause of increased glutamate levels could result from several processes, the role of CSF in glutamate regulation could indicate a possible contribution in promoting potentially neurotoxic levels of glutamate in ALS.\"\n\n\"This could again be driven by the different aspects of ALS that affect CSF dynamics, including ageing, sleep disruption and vascular factors, amongst others. It should, however, be noted that CSF glutamate levels may not necessarily reflect extracellular levels, although increased CSF glutamate concentrations could likely affect exposed astrocytes.\"\n\n\"A further pathway already described by others is that spread of the disease (ALS) could occur via the CSF circulation. The presence of misfolded proteins, including TDP-43 and SOD1, has already been demonstrated in ALS-CSF, and, whilst neurons could potentially directly ingest these proteins through phagocytic mechanisms, another plausible mechanism previously suggested would be via uptake of exosomes containing the misfolded proteins.\"\n\nhttps://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-020-01018-0"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"csfdn\"].value_counts().plot.barh(title='CSF dn', color='b')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#DC143C; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%\">Proteomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid identifies biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</h1>\n\nAuthors: Srikanth Ranganathan, Eric Williams, Philip Ganchev, Vanathi Gopalakrishnan, David Lacomis, Leo Urbinelli, Kristyn Newhall, Merit E.

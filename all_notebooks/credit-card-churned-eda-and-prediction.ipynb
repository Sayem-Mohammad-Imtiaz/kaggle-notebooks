In Categorical feature, Attrition Customer is significantly lower than Existing Customer.\n2. Highest attrition number from each feature:\n    * GENDER\n        - The number of customers with the highest attrition in Feature Gender is female with a greater percentage of 2.3%. The Gender Female Ratio is also greater than Existing, with a value of 0.17. This figure is greater than the Male Gender for Attrition with a value of 0.14. However, this figure does not affect.\n    * EDUCATION LEVEL\n        - The number of customers with the highest attrition at the Feature Education Level is Graduate with a percentage of 4.81%. For Education Level, the ratio of subscribers to Attrition is more or less the same from High School to College levels. And, slowly there is an increase in the ratio from postgraduate to doctoral level.\n        - The increase in this ratio is because the numbers decrease when the Educational Level increases, so it cannot be said that a high ratio tends for greater Attrition. It needs to be seen from other aspects.\n    * MARITAL STATUS\n        - The number of customers with the highest attrition on the Feature Marital Status is Married with a percentage of 7% and Single at 6.6%. The ratio for Single is 0.16, Divorce and Unknown is 0.17. The ratio numbers for Single, Divorced, and Unknown is bigger than Married with a value of 0.15. So, the Single category has a bigger chance for Attrition, because the ratio is bigger than Married and with an amount that is not much different than Married.\n        - The tendency for Attrition in Marital Status Single can be triggered because they do not have more dependents than Married and Divorced ones.\n    * Income Category\n        - The number of subscribers with the highest attrition in the Feature Income Category is Less than 40k with a percentage of 6.04%. The higher the income category, the lower the number of Customers.\n        - The lowest attrition ratio in the Income Category is 60k-80k with a value of 0.18 compared to other categories.\n        - The income category ratio of 120k + is the same as Less than 40k with a value of 0.17, this ratio is the highest compared to other categories. The ratio at 120k + is high because the income level is the highest and the number is the least, therefore the attrition ratio is high even though the number of attractive customers is 4.8% different compared to Less than 40k.\n    * Card Category\n        - The number of subscribers with the highest Attrition in the feature Card Category is Blue, with a very large percentage of 15%, this figure is closer to the total of Attrition Customers of 16.07%.\n        - You could also say that the majority of Customer Attrition on Category Blue Cards.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Numeric Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

This means that the remaining debt from borrowing that has not been paid each month, in 12 months with a monthly average of less than 750 is more likely for Attrition.\n    - I hypothesize that users who have a small Revolving Balance every month do not tend to use it according to the portion. Users with income levels according to their daily needs. So, users with stable income like this feel disadvantaged by using credit cards with interest rates, so they tend to quit or move to other banks with lower interest rates.\n    \n2. Total Transaction Amount\n    - High Customer Attrition on the number of transactions less than 2500 dollars per customer on average in the last 12 months. These customers feel that they rarely use credit cards which makes them more likely to stop.\n\n3. Total Transaction Count\n    - High Customer Attrition on the number of transactions less than 50 times per customer in the last 12 months. These customers feel that they rarely use credit cards which makes them more likely to stop.\n    \n4. Change in Transaction Count (Q4 over Q1)\n    - Change in Transaction Count is the ratio of the increase in the use of the number of credit cards compared to each quarter, the highest Customer Attrition with a value of less than 0.5. This means that there is no change in the number of credit card uses every quarter.\n\n5.

And the lack of a card usage ratio in daily activities.\n\nFrom the existing problems, we can take the solution to suppress the Attrition Customer number:\n1. Expand the use of credit cards, especially for Category Blue cards from a wider variety of sectors, marketplaces, various merchants, property, health, education, transportation, and others. Create a promotion that can generate interest in using a credit card. In this way, the ratio of credit card usage automatically makes customers think again when they stop using it.\n2. Make a requirement if the card is not used at all in 2 months, an administration fee will be charged.\n3. Make the requirements again if you have subscribed to a credit card and if you stop later, the promos that the old customers get will not be valid again when registering again.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pre Processing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First we drop Clientinum feature.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = data.copy()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:07:59.940027Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:07:59.940497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:07:59.94707Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:07:59.940465Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:07:59.946303Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(data.columns[0], axis = 1, inplace = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:08:08.246719Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:08:08.247104Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:08:08.255966Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:08:08.247074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:08:08.254846Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Outliers Check","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_box(column):\n    plt.boxplot(df_all[column])\n    plt.title(column)\n    plt.show()\n\nfor i in col_num:\n    plot_box(i)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:09:17.362951Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:09:17.363362Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:09:18.928457Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:09:17.363326Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:09:18.927395Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Terdapat outliers signifikan pada feature:\n1.

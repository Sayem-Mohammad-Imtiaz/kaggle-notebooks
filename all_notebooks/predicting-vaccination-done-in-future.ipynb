Looking to a future where there are likely to be more and more serious outbreaks and pandemics, how can the pharma industry prepare and speed up vaccine development?\n\nAs we already know that **Covid-19** have affected our life and our economy. Although some of the countries have created their vaccines for corona virus but still it takes a long time to get all the people vaccinated. so In this dataset we will predict or analyze which country are more progressing in vaccines drive and what time it will take for vaccines to come.\n\n***SO what are You waiting for Lets get

scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a   certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;\n* Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;\n* Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination for that

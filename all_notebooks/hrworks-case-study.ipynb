This makes sense as candidates always aspire more than the calibre. We also see few candidates who were offered a high per cent hike in CTC which can be related to those candidates who were expecting these hikes This strongly suggests that these set of candidates had applied for a managerial level or equivalent positions\n\n* A lot of Percent difference in Percent difference CTC is incorrect, thus we will remove them in Outlier Analysis\n\n* Most of the Candidates were having 0 to 8 years of experience. Experience candidates are more likely to join as experienced people understand the work ethics of the corporate world, they don't want to exploit them\n\n* The ones who did not join were given as high as 200 days to accept the offer which suggests that the candidate must be of greater importance to the company as no company offers a time span of 8 months to accept the offer\n\n* Notice Period of a company varies ranging from 0 days to 120 days. Candidates who did not join were given more options of Notice Period starting from 0 days to about 90 days while mostly who joined were not given 0 days of the notice period (except one outlier). This suggests that candidates who joined are less bothered about the notice period","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Outlier

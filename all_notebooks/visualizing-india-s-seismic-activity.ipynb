It is useful since it can reveal vital patterns and trends in the landscape.  There are many libraries available to analyze such data, but often there is a lot of manual effort involved. Memory management of geospatial data is another issue. This means the magnitude of such data makes it a little difficult to process and analyze it easily.\n\n[Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/)  is a powerful open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets. Developed by Uber, Kepler.gl is a data-agnostic and high-performance web-based application for large-scale geolocation data sets. You very easily find patterns in a dataset, combine different datasets, perform aggregations and manipulations in real-time. If a dataset has a timestamp, geopoints, and some meta information, Kepler.gl can automatically extract the information and visualize it. \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n    \nüóíÔ∏è Incase you want to know more, here is an article that goes deeper into the theory behind the library along with other useful resources: [Visualizing India‚Äôs Seismic activity](https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-indias-seismic-activity-4ed390de298c?sk=12befb1ffd589de4bb5251892b161a25)\n    \n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##Installation\n!pip install keplergl","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:50:47.092562Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:50:47.093074Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:03.078056Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:50:47.092968Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:03.07688Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing necessary libaries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom keplergl import KeplerGl ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:03.07993Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:03.080239Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.015054Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:03.080193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.013754Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing the dataset\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/indian-earthquakes-dataset2018-onwards/Indian_earthquake_data.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.017112Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.01742Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.078456Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.017388Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.077262Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#preprocessing dataset\n\ndf['Origin Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Origin Time'])\ndf['Place'] = df.apply(lambda x: x['Location'].split(',')[1], axis=1)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.080293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.080601Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.522637Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.080567Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.521607Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Visualizing with Kepler.gl\n\nmap_1 = KeplerGl(height=600)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.52401Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.524331Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.536109Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.524299Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.535094Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"map_1.add_data(data=df, name='Indian Earthquake Visualization')\nmap_1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.537467Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.537769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.722095Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.537737Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.721324Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Saving the map\n#map_1.save_to_html(file_name='Indian Earthquake Visualization.html')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.723405Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.723884Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.727439Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.723839Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T05:51:04.726394Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

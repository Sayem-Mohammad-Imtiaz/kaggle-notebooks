This dataset interests me since it allows me to understand the general sentiment of the user based upon the reviews available on Amazon. I will compile this dataset with the reviewer dataset to print a wordcloud incorporating the keywords identified on several appliance reveiws. This helps the user with a gist of the reviews rather than going individually through each of the reviews.

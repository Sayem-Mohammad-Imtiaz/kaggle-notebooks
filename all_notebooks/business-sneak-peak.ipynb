It is important to know the LTV, as this can be used to understand how much value is the customer giving to the store. \n\n\nThe traditional approach to estimating LTV is through this equation:\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value = Average Order Value * Estimated Number of Purchases at some fixed time period * the average length of the customer relationship\n\n    Where: Average Order Value = Sum of Sales for the customer/Total transactions\n    \n\nOne problem when using this equation is that a single churn rate is used all throughout the entire customer base. However, that is impossible since every customer has their own level of engagement with the store. Another is that the average order value, which is unique for each customer, assumes that it is consistent all throughout time. To overcome this, the Beta Geometric Negative Binomial Distribution model willl be used, to address the issues of the traditional formula and answer the number of purchases as well as the churn rate. This will then be tied into the Gamma-Gamma model which predicts the average order value of the customer at that instant of time.\n\nThe Beta Geomteric Negative Binomial Distribution model, creates an output that would estimate the number of purchases within some time period, as well as the probability of the customer going back to the store. This has the following assumptions:\n\n1. That the number of transactions within some period can be modelled using a poisson distribution. The poisson distribution is being used here since this type of process models how many events would occur within some fixed period with a rate of transaction, lambda.\n2. The transaction rate of each customer can be modelled using a Gamma distributed plot. The Gamma distribution answers on how long of a time should someone wait till the nth event will occur.\n3. Each customer becomes inactive after each transaction with probability, p, and is estimated using a beta distribution. This kind of distribution answers the probabilities. In this case, since we're trying to answer the probability of the customer going back to the store, then this would fit well to the problem.\n\n\nLastly, the Gamma-Gamma model predicts the AOV of the customer in the future. \n\n1. Similar to the BG NBD model, it assumes that the transaction is Gamma distributed, with shape p and scale v.\n2. While scale v is being also assumed having a Gamma distribution.\n\nNow that we know the idea behind gettting the LTV of the customer, we're using the [lifetimes library](https://pypi.org/project/Lifetimes/) to model and predict the future purchases in the next 30 days.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install Lifetimes\n\nfrom lifetimes import BetaGeoFitter #used to compute for the number of transactions at period T, and proabability that the customer is alive\nfrom lifetimes import GammaGammaFitter #used to compute for the average sales per transaction\nfrom lifetimes.plotting import plot_frequency_recency_matrix, plot_probability_alive_matrix\nfrom lifetimes.utils import summary_data_from_transaction_data, calculate_alive_path","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When using the lifetimes package, it is important to transform your transactional data into RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value).

Recency - The difference between your first purchase transaction and the last purchase. \n2. Frequency - The number of times a customer has done a repeat purchase. However, in case a customer has done multiple transactions in a single day it will still be considered as 1. Computation for frequency: Number of total transactions that have unique days - 1\n3.

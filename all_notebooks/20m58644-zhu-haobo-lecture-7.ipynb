Germany has been in lockdown nationwide since December 16, with kindergartens and schools closed, public places and most shops closed, with only a slight relaxation in the number of parties during Christmas. A 101-year-old lady has become the first person in Germany to accept the COVID-19 vaccine And Germany is also one of the countries that has done very well in controlling the Covid-19. I think Germany can control it for the following reasons after I search the materials and news.(a) Home office policy.Germany formally implemented the home office law during the Covid-19. The law, which was adopted by the German federal cabinet on January 20, requires employers to allow their employees to work from home during the Covid-19 outbreak.Therefore, people have fewer opportunities to go out and contact. (b) Update of masks. Ordinary fabric masks are no longer allowed in Germany, and the majority of Germans have also started wearing FFP2 masks.(c) Strict control of entry and exit. As well as internal controls to limit close contact with people, Germany has also begun to restrict entry and exit screening in high-risk areas.(d) Low cost of vaccination.The price will be well below one euro, making the vaccination affordable for ordinary families. Germany has abundant medical resources, effective government response and cooperative public.As a result, Germany has a fatality rate of only 4.8% and a cure rate of 92.1%, far higher than any other country.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After that, the United States, Canada and European countries began to vaccinate gradually. Russia, which is a large country, also started vaccinating in March, and in May, the number of vaccinations in all countries started to rise, which is a very good situation. From the results, I found an interesting country - Mongolia. Mongolia only recorded its first case of vaccination on April 27, but by May 28, the vaccination rate had risen sharply to 33.77 percent in just one month. I am wondering why under the situation of \"vaccine scramble\" in the world. Mongolia, a small country bordering only two countries -- China and Russia -- is able to achieve such a high vaccination rate in such a short time. It has enough vaccine for all adults, and officials confidently promise citizens \"summer without covid-19\". How it can do it. This is largely thanks to Mongolia's partnership with China and Russia, which gives it an edge between two big vaccine-makers with global ambitions.And Mongolia approved Russia's Sputnik 5 vaccine in early February, followed by China's national vaccine three days later.Shortly thereafter, China donated 300,000 doses of Sinopharmaceuticals vaccines to Mongolia, based on the two countries' \"profound traditional friendship.\"Then in March the Mongolian government reached a deal with Russia (Gamaleya Research Institute) to buy one million doses of the satellite vaccine.That was followed by a separate deal to buy 330,000 doses of the Chinese vaccine.This made it possible to jump from 0 to 33.77 percent in just one month in May.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I believe that as the production of the vaccine increases and the price drops, the vaccine will be available to all of us, and countries will accelerate the pace of vaccination.

The three most earthquake-prone states in the United States are Washington, Oregon and California. From the news, I know that last year August's earthquake is frequent, so I select the data of August 2020 to analyze the West Coast of the United States, because it happens very frequently. According to earthquake data, California has had 2,643 earthquakes in the past 30 days and 17,935 in the past 365 days.The west coast of the Americas is prone to earthquakes because it sits at the boundary of tectonic plates. The plates here are the Pacific plate, the American plate, and the Antarctic plate.These plates collide and squeeze, the earth's crust is more active, more seismic and more volcanic. California, in particular, is right on the Pacific Rim earthquake belt, which is why it's constantly shaking.Hundreds of earthquakes occur in California each year, though most are below magnitude 2 and are not felt. In response to frequent earthquakes, the U.S. government has created an alarm system that can now issue cellphone-based alerts when an earthquake is about to strike.It also expands the system to Washington, officially covering the entire West Coast of the United States in the future.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 4.

In addition, Chile has a nationwide network of seismic monitoring stations, which have satellites and power generation facilities, and updated earthquake rules every year. More importantly, Chileans also have a certain awareness and knowledge of earthquake preparedness. Since the 1960s, there have been many major earthquakes in Chile. Especially in 1960, there was a devastating 9.5 earthquake. I watched the video of that year, and it was very scary.

Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:\n\n* recommender systems\n* online communities\n* mobile and ubiquitious technologies\n* digital libraries\n* local geographic information systems\n\nGroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.\n\n\nContent and Use of Files\n========================\n\nFormatting and Encoding\n-----------------------\n\nThe dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`\"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Misérables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.\n\n\nUser Ids\n--------\n\nMovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).\n\n\nMovie Ids\n---------\n\nOnly movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).\n\n\nRatings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAll ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nRatings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nTags Data File Structure (tags.csv)\n-----------------------------------\n\nAll tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nTags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nMovies Data File Structure (movies.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nMovie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,title,genres\n\nMovie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.\n\nGenres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:\n\n* Action\n* Adventure\n* Animation\n* Children's\n* Comedy\n* Crime\n* Documentary\n* Drama\n* Fantasy\n* Film-Noir\n* Horror\n* Musical\n* Mystery\n* Romance\n* Sci-Fi\n* Thriller\n* War\n* Western\n* (no genres listed)\n\n\nLinks Data File Structure (links.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nIdentifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n\nmovieId is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.\n\nimdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.\n\ntmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862>.\n\nUse of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.\n\n\nCross-Validation\n----------------\n\nPrior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see [LensKit](http://lenskit.org) for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movies","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tags","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"links","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.merge(left = links['movieId'], right = movies, how = 'inner')\ndata = pd.merge(left = data, right = ratings.drop(['timestamp'], axis = 'columns'), how = 'inner')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['title'].value_counts().describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['count'] = 1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 1, figsize = (20,6))\ndata['title'].value_counts()[:10].plot(kind = 'bar', ax = ax)\nax.set_title('Top 10 movies of rating counts', fontsize = 15)\nax.tick_params(labelrotation = 10)\nax.set_ylabel('Count')\nplt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_pivot_for_count_rating = data.drop(['userId'], axis = 'columns').pivot_table(index = ['title'], aggfunc = {'count': 'sum', 'rating': 'mean'})\ndata_pivot_for_count_rating = data_pivot_for_count_rating.sort_values(by = ['count'], ascending = False)\ndata_pivot_for_count_rating","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize = (25, 6))\ndata_pivot_for_count_rating[:10]['rating'].plot(kind = 'bar', position = 0, width = 0.2, ax = ax1, color = 'r', label = 'rating')\nax1.tick_params(rotation = 10)\nax1.set_ylabel('rating', fontsize = 13)\nax1.set_xlabel('Movie Title', fontsize = 13)\nax1.set_ylim(0, 5)\nax2 = ax1.twinx()\ndata_pivot_for_count_rating[:10]['count'].plot(kind = 'bar', position = 1, width = 0.2, ax = ax2, label = 'count')\nax2.set_ylabel('count', fontsize = 13)\nax2.set_ylim(0, 400)\nplt.suptitle('Top 10 movies of rating and count', fontsize = 15)\nline1, label1 = ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()\nline2, label2 = ax2.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax2.legend(line1 + line2, label1 + label2, loc = 'best', fontsize = 13)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movie_data = data.drop(['count'], axis = 'columns').pivot_table(index = 'userId', columns = 'movieId', values = 'rating')\nmovie_data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"n_movie = movie_data.shape[1]\nn_user = movie_data.shape[0]\n\nprint('The number of movies:', n_movie)\nprint('The number of users:', n_user)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 유사도 척도 함수 정의"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1) Pearson 상관계수"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define Correlation\ndef calculate_correlation(x1, x2):\n    x1_mean, x2_mean = x1.mean(), x2.mean()\n    x1_centered, x2_centered = x1 -

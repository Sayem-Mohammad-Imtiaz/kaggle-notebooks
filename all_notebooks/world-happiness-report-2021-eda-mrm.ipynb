The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.\n\n### Content\nThe happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a id= \"EDA\"></a>\n\nWe first want to analyze the data set to summarize it's main characteristics.

They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This is called the Cantril ladder: it asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The rankings are from nationally representative samples, for the years 2018-2020. They are based entirely on the survey scores, using the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.\n\n1) **Ladder score**: Happiness or subjective well-being score.  Unless stated otherwise, it is the national average response to the question of life evaluations. The English wording of the question is “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”<br>\n2) **Logged GDP per capita**: Natural logarithm of the GDP p.c.for each country. For example for Finland the log_e(45100.00)=10.7166.  The gross domestic product measures the country's economic output per person.  It is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population.<br> \n3) **Social support**: (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”<br> \n4) **Healthy life expactancy**: Healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository (Last updated: 2020-09-28). The data at the source are available for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016. To match this report’s sample period (2005-2020), interpolation and extrapolation are used.<br> \n5) **Freedom to make life choices**: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” <br>\n6) **Generosity**: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.<br> \n7) **Perceptions of corruption**: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, we use the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level. <br>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Types\n\nThe Regional Indicator is a catagorical variable.

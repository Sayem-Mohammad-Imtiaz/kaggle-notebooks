would be more useful if:\n- They were consolidated into one figure\n- You could toggle between state and county groupbys, the location of markets, per capita income, farmers markets per capita and population\n- Perhaps there are easier libraries to work with than plotly for this purpose?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusions\n\n- We established that per capita income was moderately linearly correlated (Pearsons r 0.43 p=0.0015) with per capita farmers markets at the state level but not at the county level\n- Population showed more correlation with market counts and markets per capita at a state level, than the various wealth metrics such as per capita income. This makes sense as farmers markets will do more business and therefore be more attactive for people to set up, in areas where there are more people and generally more wealth\n- At a county level, farmers market density is far more strongly correlated with population, than the wealth metrics. Again this make sense, as more markets will pop up where there are more people and therefore more demand for food in general\n- From the maps above we can see that farmers markets are widespread across the counties and states of the US and commonly located near population centres\n- An overlay of population and agricultural production on the some of the maps above, might indicate if farmers markets are more accessible (by the metric of farmers markets per capita) in \"rural\" areas of the US, where there tends to be more agriculture and fewer people\n- Farmers market per capita is probably not the best metric of accessibility in many ways, as it doesn't really take into account how close people are to the market. A vast, less populated state will have more farmers markets per capita but they may not be easily accessible if the average journey time to a market is prohibitive\n- It would be nice to do some multivariate clustering or correlation to see if there are any other more complex higher dimensional correlations, between the total or per capita farmers markets in each of the US states or counties and combinations of the available features in the data\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Things to improve/reflect upon\n- The naming of dataframes and groupby objects needs to be clear to avoid confusion\n- Do you need to use sets to find common column values in multiple dataframes or can you do it within Pandas?\n- Pearson r measures linear correlations, Spearmans and Kendall correlation test might tell you something about non-linear relationships\n- The normalised overlayed barplot of \"per capita income\" vs \"markets per capita\" is redundant, if you have a pairplot with a linear model, confidence interval and pearsonsr. Though I suppose it gives you a sense of if the linear relationship between per capita income and per capita markets is strong enough to see by eye.\n- Working with maps inevitably requires external data, the veracity/completeness of which you have to be careful with. I think the map figures would benefit from consolidation and the addition of data selection widgets as discussed\n- Using more functions to organise and reuse code blocks for plotting, groupby and variable formatting operations on data frames, would make things quicker to develop and easier to read back over. I will have try to remember to do this from the beginning of my next analysis\n\n","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

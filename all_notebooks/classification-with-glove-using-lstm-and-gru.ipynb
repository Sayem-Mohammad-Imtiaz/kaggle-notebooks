In this exercise, we will set the weights of the Embedding layer to the embedding matrix from GloVe pre-trained vectors.This is a tranfer learning. \n\nAnother parameter in Embedding layer is \"trainable\" which can be set to True in case you want to fine-tune the word embedding or if you don't want the embedding weights to be updated you can set it to False. Here, we set it to False.<br>\n\nAfter the Embedding layer, we have a layer of LSTM or GRU and then a Dropout layer for regularization. \n\nThen we have a Dense layer with Sigmoid activation which transforms the output of previous layers to 0 or 1 (real or fake). \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## LSTM\nLet's start with LSTM models.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lstm_model = Sequential()\nlstm_model.add(Embedding(vocab_len, emb_dim, trainable = False, weights=[embedding_matrix]))\nlstm_model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=False))\nlstm_model.add(Dropout(0.5))\nlstm_model.add(Dense(1, activation = 'sigmoid'))\nlstm_model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\nprint(lstm_model.summary())","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T18:54:19.94296Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T18:54:19.943334Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T18:54:22.646195Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T18:54:19.943302Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T18:54:22.64527Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nbatch_size = 256\nepochs  = 10\nhistory = lstm_model.fit(xtrain_pad, np.asarray(ytrain), validation_data=(xtest_pad, np.asarray(ytest)), batch_size = batch_size, epochs = epochs)\n","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T18:54:26.352788Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T18:54:26.353106Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T18:55:40.531142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T18:54:26.353077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T18:55:40.530248Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## LSTM -

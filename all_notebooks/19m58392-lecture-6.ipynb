The first death was confirmed on March 6th. A week later, the museum was closed and events for more than 100 people were canceled. In Japan, the school was closed first, but the school wasn't closed yet because the Netherlands decided that children weren't heavily affected by COVID-19.\nBut a few days later, the closure of schools, restaurants and cafes was announced. We decided to do it until April 6th, including the various measures announced so far.\nOn 16 March, it was decided to implement border measures across the EU, and restrictions on travel to the EU began.\nA week later, Intelligent Lockdown was decided. It has also been announced that the deadline for banning meetings that has been announced will be extended to June 1. In addition, there were various announcements. For example, it is forbidden for three or more people to act without taking a distance, or to close work that involves physical contact. There were also announcements that they would be fined.\nThere was an announcement on 22nd April about the reopening of the elementary school. Specifically, the school started on May 11th, with half attendance and remote lessons combined in the classroom.\nAnd on May 6th, it was announced that junior high school will be reopened and jobs that involve contact will be resumed. Middle school was reopened on June 1st, and from May 11th, it was allowed to resume occupations involving contact. I think it was restarted as scheduled, but I could not find the news.\nIn addition, restaurants, movie theaters, and museums will be reopened on June 1.\nIn addition, it was mandatory to wear a mask when using public transportation. Violators can also be fined.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Reference\n\nhttps://oranda.jp/info/corona-timeline/\nhttps://oranda.jp/info/lockdown/\nhttps://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/dutch-response-to-coronavirus\nhttps://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

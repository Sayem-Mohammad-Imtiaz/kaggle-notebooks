Given that, can we accurately predict if a player will make a hit or a miss? In order to answer that, I'm going to use data from the 2014/2015 season containing variables like shot distance and shot clock. In this kernel I will explore the dataset to visualize the feature distributions and their relationships, as well as, use unsupervised learning algorithms to figure out structure in the data. Then I will use tree algorithms to predict the shot and also understand which variables are the more important in the classification. **If you like the notebook, please give it an upvote!**\n\n##

The algorithm's core ideia is to split the feature space in smaller regions so that each of these regions are as pure as possible. In other words, we want the regions to have mostly one class. These splits can be interpreted as rules that divide the space in two. For example, we can split the data whether the shot distance is greater or lower than 15 ft. \n\nSince this algorithm sequencially split the feature space in two regions, we can think of it as a binary tree where each node represents a split (i.e. a rule) and the leaves represents regions of the space where the purity should be higher. In classification tasks, the training set is used to figure out these rules and create good leaves. Then, to predict an instance we follow these rules and use the points contained in the leave to devise a prediction, which is usually the most frequent class among these points.\n\nIf we let the tree grow indefinitely, we would end up overfitting the training set. That's because each subsequent split will be more specific and it will end up fitting the noise of the data, instead of capturing the general patterns. So it is necessary to regularize it controlling the depth of tree, i.e., the number of splits used. Another option is to use cost-complexity pruning, but controlling depth is easier and more efficient.\n\nIn this part I'm going to implement a function to train and test the decision tree using cross-validation.

But before we explore random forests, it's important to understand why decision trees aren't very good. A very common problem is that they can easily overfit. We tried to avoid this behaviour by controlling the depth of the tree, but sometimes it's not enough. More sophisticated ways of controling the decision tree are using cost-complexity pruning or tuning other hyperparameters. The problem is that fitting a decision tree with this added complexity can become time consuming. Another problem is that slightly changes in the dataset can drastically change the structure of the tree. In other words, decision trees usually have high variance.\n\nRandom forests were proposed to address some of these issues. A random forest is actually composed of set of decision trees, each one independently fitted on a resampled version of the training set. The main ideia is to use bootstraping to decresase the variance of the prediction by \"averaging\" (actually in classification we use the majority vote) the result of the trees. In addition to that, in order to make each indidual tree even more different, random forests only consider a limited number of features in each split. To sum it up, random forests offer two advantages:\n\n- It creates variability by using a different dataset (resampled) in each tree.\n- Reduces the impact of very important or correlated features, allowing the trees to explore different ways of splitting the feature space.\n\nImportant hyperparameters in the model are the number of trees and the number of features, but it's always good to control the depth of the tree or the sample size in each split or leave to avoid overfitting. In this case, I'm going to set the number of trees to 100, which is probably high enough to get a good set of different trees, and I'm going to use $\\sqrt{11}$ variables in each split, which is a recommended number in the book Introduction to Statistical Learning. Finally, I'm going to employ grid search to figure out the best model configuration on the other hyperparameters.\n\nTo do so, I'm going to use scikit-learn's Grid Search class, which provides an easy interface to run a grid search over a cross-validation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"param_grid = {\n    'n_estimators': [100],\n    'criterion': ['gini'],\n    'max_depth': [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50],\n    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10, 15],\n    'min_samples_leaf': [2, 5, 10, 15],\n    'max_features': ['sqrt']\n}\n\ngrid_search_cv = GridSearchCV(\n    estimator = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs = -1, random_state = 42),\n    param_grid = param_grid,\n    scoring = ['accuracy', 'roc_auc'],\n    n_jobs = -1,\n    refit = 'roc_auc',\n    cv = 5,\n    verbose = 3,\n    return_train_score = True    \n).fit(x_train, y_train)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T22:32:05.024831Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T22:32:05.025641Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"scores = pd.DataFrame(grid_search_cv.cv_results_).sort_values('rank_test_roc_auc')\n\nprint('Best model')\nprint('***********')\nprint('Mean validation accuracy: ', scores.iloc[0, :]['mean_test_accuracy'])\nprint('Mean validation AUC: ', grid_search_cv.best_score_, '\\n')\nprint('Best hyperparameters')\nprint('***********')\nfor param, val in grid_search_cv.best_params_.items():\n    print(param + ':', val)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T22:32:05.034123Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T22:32:05.034875Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As I expected, accuracy and AUC improved, althought not too much.

Also, shuffling a variable has a greater AUC impact on the random forest than in the decision tree.\n\n## Gradient Boosting Machine\n\nInstead of fitting a number of trees in parallel, another way to improve decision trees is by stacking them. The core idea of a boosting algorithm is to use a sequence of weak learners to gradually, step by step, learn a function that best approximate our target. Generally these weak learners are decision trees with a small number of leaves (small depth) that constraint the number of interactions between variables. For example, if we have $d$ leaves, at most $d-1$ variables were used in the tree.\n\nIn addition to that, each tree is fitted based on the residuals of the approximated funcion up until that tree. Notice that for this to work in a classification task, the prediction of tree must be the odds. This allows the weaker learners to focus on specific areas where the previous learners didn't perform well. Thus, the final function will be the sum of the predictions of each tree. However, we can do two more things to further improve boosting algorithms. First, we can multiply each tree's prediction by a shrinkage parameter to slow even more the process. This parameter can be fixed and tuned using grid search, but in Grandient Boosting Machines this shrinkage parameter is found by using gradient descent. So in each boosting step, we solve a optimization problem where we want to minimize a loss function that depends on the shrinkage. Second, we can multiply the shrinkage parameter and the weak learner prediction by a learning rate. This learning rate is fixed and should be fine-tuned.\n\nTherefore, typically we have three essential parameters to fine-tune and avoid overfitting: number of tree, depth of leaves and learning rate. If we want to get the best perfomance out of GBM's, we could also search for the best parameters related to the tree construction. Notice that if let the algorithm build a very long stack of learners it will easily overfit. Instead of grid searching each value for the number of tree, we can use the test set to access when to stop stacking models.\n\nTo evaluate this model and figure out the best hyperparameter values, I'm going to use LightGMB and Optuna. The latter is a optimization package that implements a bayesian approach to make a guided search in the hyperparameter space.

Passengers scrambled to the deck for their only chance at survival, but ultimately many met their fate trapped in the cabins as the ship capsized. Out of the 989 people (of which 803 were listed as passengers) onboard the ship, there were 852 deaths and 137 survivors.\n\nIn this analysis, I will be exploring the correlation between surviving the disaster (dependent variable) in relation to the person's age, gender and whether they were a crewmember or passenger (independent variables).\n\nWas age a factor in survival? Did a greater proportion of crewmembers survive the disaster than passengers? These questions I will attempt to answer with my analysis.

Hold on, didn't I say there were 803 people categorized as passengers in the introduction?\n\nAs it turns out, several sources have conflicting reports on the amount of crewmembers onboard the ship when it sank. This is due to the fact that some crewmembers onboard the ship were either off-duty or just not accounted for, so therefore they were not recorded in the crew list.\n\nThe Joint Accident Investigation Commission of Estonia, Finland, and Sweden released a report in December 1997 that stated there was 186 crewmembers onboard. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040626020651/http://www.onnettomuustutkinta.fi/estonia/chapt04.html#2\">Link</a>\n\nEstline, the shipping company that owned the MS Estonia at the time of the sinking, made available the official crew list of the MS Estonia. The list recorded the names of 187 crewmembers and their respective job titles. <a href=\"https://estline.ee/en/munsterroll-crewlist\">Link</a>\n\nBesides the official crew list by Estline, I could not locate many other lists detailing the individuals who were part of the crew at the time of the sinking. I stumbled upon a Blogger blog <i>Estonia disaster</i> by user \"passante\", which had a crew list that seemed consistent with the official Estline crew list. It also had the job titles listed in English and gave additional context on whether the crewmember was actually off-duty at the time. This list states there were 189 crewmembers onboard. <a href=\"http://estoniadisaster1994.blogspot.com/2017/02/estonia-crew-list.html\">Link</a>\n\nI will have to compare the dataset with the Estline provided crew list and perhaps crosscheck it with the Blogger list as well, then make adjustments to the categorization of the passengers accordingly.

Since I am filtering rows to meet two criteria, I defined function adv_row_count which just adds a second set of parameters to accommodate the second criteria. I also defined function output_stats to save myself a lot of copy-pasting to output the total counts and proportions.

There were no survivors under 12 years old, and none older than 67 years old. There was a downward trend in survivors as age increased in a normal distribution of ages. A greater proportion of crewmembers survived, with 22% of the crew and only 12% of passengers surviving. Furthermore, a greater proportion of males survived in both categories, with 34% of male crewmembers and 19% of male passengers surviving. Only 12% of female crewmembers and 4% of female passengers survived.\n\nMy shortcomings included lack of knowledge of individuals who were able to board the lifeboats/liferafts deployed to increase chance of survival, and the exact location of individuals and their cabins at the time of the disaster.

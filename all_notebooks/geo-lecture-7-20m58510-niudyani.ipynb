Small earthquakes with magnitude range from 1 - 5 mag frequently hit the area at North-west part of America and area that bordered with Pacific North-West area. The frequent earthquake occurred in this area were correlated to the geological composition of this area, western United States lies along the boundaries of major tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s crust—the North American Plate and the ocean plates to the west. These plates are moving against each other, breaking up the crust along many faults like the San Andreas Fault. Faults in the East are less active and lie entirely within the North American Plate. Different case with Eastern part of America, the magnitude of the earthquake in this area can be twice of the western part, but the frequency is relatively rare. \n\nSource : \nhttps://www.usgs.gov/news/east-vs-west-coast-earthquakes\nhttps://www.usgs.gov/faqs/why-are-there-so-many-earthquakes-and-faults-western-united-states?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=latest+earthquake+in+california+thursday+june+2021&safe=strict&sxsrf=ALeKk01dnAejkhUP5bZY1MU30-08UwTlAA%3A1622994938582&ei=-u-8YMOQI5XEz7sP1PGi2Aw&oq=latest+earthquake+in+california+Thursday+June+2&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMYADIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgUIIRCgATIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABMgQIIRAVOgcIABBHELADOgoIABCwAxDJAxBDOgoILhCwAxDIAxBDOgIIADoGCAAQFhAeOggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCCEQChCgAToECCEQCkoFCDgSATFQztoBWJSzAmDEwQJoCXACeACAAcgBiAHbGJIBBjUuMTkuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQvAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz\n\n2. Minor to the medium earthquake occurred at Pacific ring of fire zone which mainly hit Indonesia, Japan, and some occurred at the pacific sea. The magnitude range is within 4.5- 6 mag. These frequent earthquakes correlated to the active volcanic plates beneath the region. The latest strong earthquake hit at Coast of Honshu, Japan, on Saturday, 1 May 2021 at 01:27 (GMT), with no casualties but several residential and city in Japan experienced string shaking for almost 10 seconds (based on the news reports). \n\"Along a 100 km stretch of the coast near Sendai, people experienced strong shaking (VI on the Mercalli scale). Beyond the area of strong shaking, it was felt more lightly in up to several hundred km distance, over large parts of Japan. Our monitoring service received numerous reports from people all over Honshu who felt it within minutes after the quake struck. Most people described horizontal ground movements that lasted 10-20 seconds, depending on the distance from the epicenter, suggesting that it was mainly the secondary (side-wise swinging) earthquake waves that reached the country's interior.\"\n\nIn addtion, the map shown frequent earthquake in Indonesia. Several studies also mention, the country is vulnerable to earthquake. a medium to strong earthquake freequently hit the country. The frequent earthquake that hit the country were correlated to geological and geographical situation, Indonesia is situated at the ring of fire and above the tectonic map. \n\nThe siginificant earthquake with magnitude 5,6 mag- 6,8 mag hits several areas at middle-east part of Indonesia such as East Java City, Bali and Malang, it was reported 6 casulaties and dozens of homes were damaged due to the earthquake in Blitar on 21st May 2021.  It was centered in waters south of the Malang District in East Java Province and had a depth of 51 miles.  The recent strong earthquake happened at the begining of 2021 when a magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500, while more than 92,000 were displaced, after striking Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi Province.  Indonesia was not as great as Japan in term of handling earthquake disaster when the magnitude of the quake becomes more than six on the scale of Richter, then an earthquake can potentially do a lot of damage. It was partly inflicted by the bad states of some housing facilities and infrastructure in Indonesia. \n\n\n\n\nsource :\nhttps://voyapon.com/earthquakes-japan/#:~:text=There%20are%20approximately%205%2C000%20minor,measured%20between%203.0%20and%203.9.&text=However%2C%20around%20160%20earthquakes%20with,the%20Japanese%20archipelago%20each%20year.\nhttps://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/6226676/2021-05-01/01h27/magnitude6-Japan.html\n\nhttps://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/6252319/2021-05-21/12h09/magnitude6-Indonesia.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/10/world/asia/indonesia-earthquake.html","metadata":{}}]}

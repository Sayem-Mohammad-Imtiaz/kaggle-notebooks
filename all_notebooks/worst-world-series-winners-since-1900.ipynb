And always looking to bone up on my Python (which is rookie-level at best), I gave it a shot. Out of all of the winners of the World Series in the modern era (since 1900), we want to find out who was the \"worst\" team to actually win it. The analysis is rather cursory, so we'll simply use low winning percentage and worst run differential per 162 games as our metrics. Also, thanks to Nel Abdiel who wrote a script for this dataset...much of my code is modeled after your own.

Without exploring too much into it, we can consider these \ntwo teams to be the \"worst\" World Series winners. Of course, there are plenty of factors that could \ninfluence this. For instance, the Twins of 1987 actually held the 5th best record out of 14 teams \nin the AL. But because of playing in a weak division, only two divisions in the AL, and no divisional \nseries/wild card, they were able to knock off the Tigers in 5 games and the Cardinals in 7 games to win it \nall. Injuries may also play a factor as well, as seemingly no championship team goes uninjured. But based\nsolely on these metrics, Kirby Puckett's Twins and Albert Pujols' Cardinals certainly couldn't be considered\n\"favorites\" to win it all, to say the least."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

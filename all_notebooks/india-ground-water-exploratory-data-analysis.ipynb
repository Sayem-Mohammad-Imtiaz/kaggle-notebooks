India is an enormous country with very diverse lifestyles. India is a country of many famous rivers flowing across the country and the world's highest rainfall zone is in India. Though, due to unplanned usage and wastage of water, many of the states in India is f facing a severe shortage of water during summer.\n\n#### Content\n##### This dataset contains 689 rows for each district in India and 16 columns for different statistical data related to water extraction and recharge. The dataset contains data for the year 2017.\n\n#### Inspiration\n##### In recent times, India is going through a severe water crisis in many of the regions during the summer. Proper planning and forecasting can save wastage of water. Distribution of water and regulating the extraction of groundwater can be done more efficiently by analyzing the dataset.\n\n#### Acknowledgment\n##### The dataset is provided by https://data.gov.in/. The dataset is open for analysis and research."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Processing"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/districtwise-ground-water-resources-by-july-2017/Dynamic_2017_2_0.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.sample(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop('S.no.', axis =1, inplace = True)\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,7))\nsns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot = True)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Get information on the columns, null values in the data\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#statewise groundwater reserve\nstate_list = []\ntotal_frnd_water_recharge = []\ncurr_gw_extr_list = []\nfuture_available_GW_list = []\n#Net Ground Water Availability for future use\n\nfor state, subset in df.groupby('Name of State'):\n    #print(state, sum(subset['Net Ground Water Availability for future use']))\n    state_list.append(state)\n    total_frnd_water_recharge.append(sum(subset['Total Annual Ground Water Recharge']))\n    curr_gw_extr_list.append(sum(subset['Total Current Annual Ground Water Extraction']))\n    future_available_GW_list.append(sum(subset['Net Ground Water Availability for future use'])) \ndfnew = pd.DataFrame({\"State\":state_list, \"GW_Recharge\":total_frnd_water_recharge, \"GW_Extraction\": curr_gw_extr_list, \"Future_GW_Available\": future_available_GW_list})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory data Analysis (EDA)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Total Rechage, Extraction, Future Availability and Annual Reserve by States in India"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dfnew.sort_values(['GW_Recharge','GW_Extraction'], inplace= True)\ndfnew['annual_reserve'] = dfnew['GW_Recharge']-dfnew['GW_Extraction']\ndfnew","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Annual Reserve of Ground water by states, Green bars indicate positive annual reserve, while Red value indicates negative annual reserve."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,8))\nplt.barh(dfnew['State'],dfnew['annual_reserve'], color=(dfnew['annual_reserve']>0).map({True: 'g',False: 'r'}))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Following analysis indiates Groundwater Extraction vs Availability,Data shows Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Delhi are in critial zone as Ground water Extraction is almost equal to the availability.

Overview\n\nThe diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. The importance of a correct early diagnosis is primordial to provide care and avoid casualties. Examples of types of tests to understand if a patient is suffering or at risk of a heart attack are: electrocardiograms, cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, blood tests and exercise stress tests. Also, the literature cites risk factors for heart attacks as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking. Age, gender and genetic predisposition also play a role. \n\nThe Heart Attack UCI database originally contained 76 attributes and was created to detect the presence of heart disease in patients using ML algorithms. In the original database, the target features are integers valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. However, most experiments refer to using this dataset instead, containing only fourteen of the original attributes. Experiments with the UCI database have also concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4 as 1) from absence (value 0) of heart disease. In this notebook we follow the same approach, analysing the data as a binary classification problem.\n\n# 1.1 The Attributes\n\n* age - age in years\n* sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)\n* cp - chest pain type  (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n* trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n* chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n* fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n* restecg - Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n* thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n* exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n* oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot)\n* slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n* ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n* thal - a blood disorder called thalassemia\n* target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)\n\n# 1.2 Acknowledgements\n\nAccording to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the dataset creators are:\n\n1.

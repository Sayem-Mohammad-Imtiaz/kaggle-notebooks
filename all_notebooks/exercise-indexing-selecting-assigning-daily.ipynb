So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,9`. `loc`, meanwhile, indexes inclusively. So `0:10` will select entries `0,...,10`.\n\n> [...]\n\n> ...[consider] when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `reviews.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `reviews.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them! To get 1000 elements using `iloc`, you will need to go one higher and ask for `reviews.iloc[0:1001]`."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"df = ____\n\nq7.check()\ndf"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"#q7.hint()\n#q7.solution()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## 8.\n\nCreate a DataFrame `italian_wines` containing reviews of wines made in `Italy`.

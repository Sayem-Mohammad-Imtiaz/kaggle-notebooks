It is not an alternative to actually taking the time to learn. What it aims to do is help someone get started fast and gain intuitive understanding of the typical steps early on."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 0: Understand the problem\nWhat we're trying to do here is to classify whether someone is a liver disease patient or not."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Set-up and understand data\nThis step helps uncover issues that we will want to address in the next step and take into account when building and evaluating our model.

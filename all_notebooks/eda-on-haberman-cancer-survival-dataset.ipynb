it a relatively small set for observations\n\n The objective is to determine the characteristics of people who have survived 5 years post operation. The findings are as      \n follow:\n\n1. The average age of the patients who underwent the operation is around 50.\n\n\n2. Patients who underwent operation have ages between 30 and 80.\n\n\n2. we observed that 73% of the people who underwent the operation survived past 5 years.\n\n\n3. It has been obatained that 26% of the people who underwent the operation did not live past 5 years\n\n\n4. 75% of the patients have their age below 60.\n\n\n5. It has been observed that people below the age <=50 tend to have survived than people above the age of >50.\n\n\n6. Hence we can assume that 'age' affect the patients percentage of surival.\n\n\n7. It has been observed that a lot of the patients have nodes less than 1\n\n\n8. Patients who have nodes more than >=1 tend to have died more than peo.\n\n\n9. From the data we have observed that 64% of people have <=1 node.\n\n\n10. People with nodes 0 or <=1 tend to have survived more post operation for longer than 5 years.\n\n\n11. Hence we can assume that the number of 'nodes' affect the percentage of survival of a patient.\n    \n    \n12. We have observed that when people who have youger age, even with higher number of nodes there is a chance of survival\n\n\n13. however as age increases, people with more nodes during older age tend to have died.\n\n#### Important Features\n\n1. Number of nodes is important as we have observed that people with less number of nodes have survived past 5 years\n    post operation than people with more number of nodes.\n    \n    \n2. Age isn't impactful, however it has been observed that younger patients with more nodes have survived past 5 years and              \n   hence should duly be noted.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

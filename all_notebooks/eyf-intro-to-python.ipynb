Jupyter notebooks are one of the most commonly used IDE's (integrated development environments) and consist of a sequence of cells, where each cell is formatted in either Markdown (for writing text) or in a programming language of your choice (for writing code). \n\nKaggle Notebooks may be created and edited via the Notebook editor. On larger screens, the Notebook editor consists of three parts:\n\nAn editing window\n\nA console\n\nA settings window\n\nThe Notebook editor allows you to write and execute both traditional Scripts (for code-only files ideal for batch execution or Rmarkdown scripts) and Notebooks (for interactive code and markdown editor ideal for narrative analyses, visualizations, and sharing work).\n\nThe main difference between Scripts and Notebooks is the editing pane and how you experience editing and executing code.\n\nEditing\nWhether you use Scripts or Notebooks might depend on your choice of language and what your use case is. R users tend to prefer the Scripts, while Python users prefer the Notebooks. For more on why that is, refer to the “Types of Notebooks” section. Scripts are also favored for making competition submissions where the code is the focus, whereas Notebooks are popular for sharing EDAs (exploratory data analysis), tutorials, and other share-worthy insights.\n\nBoth editing interfaces are organized around the concept of “Versions”. This is a collection consisting of a Notebook version, the output it generates, and the associated metadata about the environment.\n\nIn the Script editor, the code you write is executed all at once, whenever you generate a new version. For finer-grained control, it’s also possible to specifically execute only a single line or selection of lines of code.\n\nNotebooks are built on Jupyter notebooks. Notebook Notebooks consist of individual cells, each of which may be a Markdown (text) cell or a code cell. Code can be run (and the resulting variables saved) by running individual code cells, and cells can be added or deleted from the notebook at any time.\n\nConsole\nThe console tab provides an alternative interface to the same Python or R container running in the Notebook. Commands you input into the console will not change the content of your version. However, any variables you create in the console will persist throughout the session (unless you delete them). Additionally, any code that you execute in the editor will also execute in the console pane.\n\nSettings\nIn the expanded editor, the settings pane takes up the right side of the screen. In the compact editor (where you hide the settings pane), it is folded into tabs above the Editor tab. In either case the settings pane contains the following tabs:\n\nThere's a tab called “Data” that provides a way of adding or removing data from the Notebook.\n\nThere's a tab called the Settings. The Settings tab has settings for toggling Language, toggling Docker image selection, toggling Internet (which is on by default), and toggling an Accelerator between CPU (default), GPU, and TPU.\n\n\n## ** ^Probably won't include this cell in the final notebook, will just walk them through it instead^ **","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic Python\n\n\n## Numeric Values\n\nWe can use Python as a basic calculator by entering values into the cells.

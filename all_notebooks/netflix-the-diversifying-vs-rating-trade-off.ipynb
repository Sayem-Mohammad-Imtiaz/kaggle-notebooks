Netflix, IMDB and the Dataset\n\n**Netflix**\n\nNetflix, Inc. is an American over-the-top content platform and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. The company's primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. In April 2021, Netflix had 208 million subscribers, including 74 million in the United States and Canada. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix)\n\n**IMDB**\n\nIMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb)\n\n**About the dataset**\n\nThis dataset consists of all Netflix original films released as of June 1st, 2021. Additionally, it also includes all Netflix documentaries and specials. The data is then integrated with a dataset consisting of all of their corresponding IMDB scores. IMDB scores are voted on by community members, and the majority of the films have 1,000+ reviews.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2.

Conclusions \n- Netflix releases production more frequent as time advances, increasing the number of series released each month. But, The rating has been decreasing as the number of films increasing, implying that netflix is aiming for catalog diversity that reaches all kind of public.\n- Language does affect Rating, since English is always present in the top rated movies by language. Not having English as a language might place the movie at the bottom\n- The genres are pretty diverse. But, there's a tendency for animated and comedy movies to be on top.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 5. Recommendations\n- Is pretty hard to increase average rating if the strategy is too increase the selection and variety, is a trade-off. But, If Netflix wants to still be competitive, it should still invest in a few high quality and original movies/series to attract new costumers and compete against the increasing number of streaming services. A focus on diversity might target niches, but if the platform won't release high grossing productions, the customer churn will be gigantic. Long story short: keep diversifying stratety along  with some high-grossing productions.\n- English is an international language and it should be present in every movie. Low-rated movies without the english option are missing the chance to reach the internaitonal community. English as a language option should be one of the priorities when launching a production in the platform.\n- As for the Genres, the strategy is pretty simple: more of the populars and less of the non-populars.

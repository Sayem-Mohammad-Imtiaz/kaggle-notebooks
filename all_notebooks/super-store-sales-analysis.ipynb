We then can see that home office segment has been gradually increasing with a bigger increase in 2017. It may be presumptuous to assume that there is a transition from workers in the corporate setting into a home office setting which can be a reason for the decline in profits in the corporate segment.

The biggest sales demographics is the consumer segment makes up about half of the sales and profits which was shown by the order volume and also proven again by the profits year over year. We also learned that even though there is a high order volume it doesn't necessarily mean that it will be the most profitable. An example of this is when we saw the order volume of office was much greater than technology and furniture, but once we got to the numbers of sales and profits, technology was actually more profitable. This is because technology has a higher cost average and a bigger profit margin compared to office supplies. We also learned that sales doesn't necessarily mean profits as shown by the comparison of furniture sales and profits.<br>While the consumer segment is very high, there may be an opportunity for an increase in the home office segment due to the new  trend of remote work or working from home. People will would like to purchase items for their home office to get set up and from the current trend in 2021, there seems to be a very large increase of jobs that are remote. Given that this is an old dataset with not much data from 2018 - 2021 it is just an assumption that I'd like to see if it true if I had the data for this. As more people get remote jobs, corporate purchases may decline as their workers are not there. <br> It would be interesting to see how both consumer and home office category is broken down and if there are any overlaps. How would did \"SuperStore\" distinguish between the two. Another important data point or KPI that wasn't included was customer satisfaction or some type of metric that can tell if the person/group who bought the item was satisfied. It'll be interesting to see if that KPI stands out in either segment or category of product. With this we can identify which segment or product category needs improvement or is outperforming the others. If customer satisfaction was included we could see if Superstore can improve on their times from order date to shipping and see if  that would have an effect. The average calculated overall 4 years was ~59 days which is very unusual. A potential future analysis that can be done is predictive modeling where we can predict future sales based on current data. This can be a separate analysis as I decided this can be an overview of their performance from 2014-2017.\n","metadata":{}}]}

The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?  These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.\n\n** consists of more than just fitting a linear line through a cloud of data points.  It consists of 3 stages – (1) analyzing the correlation and directionality of the data, (2) estimating the model, i.e., fitting the line, and (3) evaluating the validity and usefulness of the model.\n\n(1) First import the file, perform data preprocessing(removing null values, changing data type, etc) and then perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) for the data. Find if there are any correlations between the data.\n\n(2) Now we create a base model ABC, create required abstract classes. Create linearmodel class which is sub class of ABC class. Define the required methods. Now we create two classes \n\n(3) In order to know that the created model is vaild, we create plots to see the predicted line and the points where the required value should be vaild. We know that the model is valid and is useful when it passes the preliminary test, where Score and variance  with various data.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data\n\n## Description\n\nIn this dataset we have to predict the **sales price of houses in King County, Seattle**. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Before doing anything we should first know about the dataset what it contains what are its features and what is the structure of data.\n\nThe dataset cantains 20 house features plus the price, along with 21613 observations.\n\nThe description for the 20 features is given below:\n\n1. id :- It is the unique numeric number assigned to each house being sold.\n2. date :- It is the date on which the house was sold out.\n3. price:- It is the price of house which we have to predict so this is our target variable and aprat from it are our features.\n4. bedrooms :- It determines number of bedrooms in a house.\n5. bathrooms :- It determines number of bathrooms in a bedroom of a house.\n6. sqft_living :- It is the measurement variable which determines the measurement of house in square foot.\n7. sqft_lot : It is also the measurement variable which determines square foot of the lot.\n8. floors: It determines total floors means levels of house.\n9. waterfront : This feature determines whether a house has a view to waterfront 0 means no 1 means yes.\n10. view : This feature determines whether a house has been viewed or not 0 means no 1 means yes.\n11. condition : It determines the overall condition of a house on a scale of 1 to 5.\n12. grade : It determines the overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system on a scale of 1 to 11\n13. sqft_above : It determines square footage of house apart from basement.\n14. sqft_basement : It determines square footage of the basement of the house.\n15. yr_built : It detrmines the date of building of the house.\n16. yr_renovated : It detrmines year of renovation of house.\n17. zipcode : It determines the zipcode of the location of the house.\n18. lat : It determines the latitude of the location of the house.\n19. long : It determines the longitude of the location of the house.\n20. sqft_living15 : Living room area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)\n21. sqft_lot15 : lotSize area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)\n\nBy observing the data, we can know that the **price is dependent on various features** like bedrooms(which is most dependent feature), bathrooms, sqft_living(second most important feature), sqft_lot, floors etc. The price is also dependent on the location of the house where it is present. The other features like waterfront, view are less dependent on the price. Of all the records, there are **no missing values, which helps us creating better model.** \n\nFirst, we **import** the required libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib. Now import the **csv file.** Now we should get to know how the data is, what datatype using info function. We observe that date is in 'object' format. To know the no of rows and columns we use shape function. Describe the dataframe to know the mean, minumum, ,maximum, standard deviation, percentiles. \n\nNow, find if there are any null values. Luckily, there are no null values which helps us in getting the accurate model. We drop the unnecessary columns ike 'lat', 'long', 'view'. **There is an outlier in the given data.** Although it is not exactly a outlier, i would like to remove the value so that we can obtain better graph. The **no of bedrooms is '33'** for one observation. I removed that value. \n\nThe **date is in object format, so it is converted into date format** using pandas. Now, the graphs are plotted for better understanding or better analysis. The graphs like relplot, boxplot, heatplot, lineplot, catplot are used for analysis.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#import the required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy

Preliminary Observation\n\nAfter observing the data and graphs carefully, we can observe that the price is mostly dependent on the location, no of bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft living, sqft lot, floors, condition. We can note a few points:\n\n(1) The frequency of no of bedrooms=3,4 is higher than any other bedrooms. The price of these are mostly similar, but some have giher price than usual because of the other features like bathrooms, location, etc.\n\n(2) The heatmap identifies the correlations between the features which help us in identifying how the features are dependent on each other which cannot be known by seeing the data. (Example: sqft living is dependent on grade of the house)\n\n(3) The highest priced houses are sold in months: 9th to 11th. This shows people tend to spend more money on houses which are having more comforts in winter.\n\n(4) Most of the houses have sqft living in between 500 to 6000 irrespective of no of bedrooms. The higer the living space, the higher is the cost.\n\n(5) Price of the house is also dependent on sqft of lot (parking) as most people own their own car.\n\n(6) People are tending to pay less if the condition of the house is bad. They are spending more if the house is in good condition.\n\n(7) The 3d plot gives relationship between multiple features.\nPrice→Strong Correlation=Sqft living, Very Weak Correlation=Year built\nBedrooms→Moderate Correlation=Sqft living, Very Weak Correlation=Year built\nBathrooms→Strong Correlation=Sqft living, Very Weak Correlation=Sqft Lot\nSqft Living→Strong Correlation=Bathroom,

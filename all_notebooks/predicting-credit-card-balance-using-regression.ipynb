Such an exercise could be conducted as part of a customer analysis within a credit card company. The results of the analysis could determine which customers present a risk of credit default, or what the expected consumer behavior of prospective customers will be. In addition, combining the credit Balance data with information such as credit Limit can assist in calculating the credit utilization of a card, information which feeds into a cardholder's credit Rating.   \n\nFor this goal, a multivariable regression analysis will be undertaken. The exercise will begin with an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, followed by feature selection and regression analysis, including linear and logistic regression. Lastly, the regression model created will be employed to simulate a new dataset and predict the credit Balance of cardholders given their demographic information.

For example if a cardholder spends \\$400, \\$500, and \\$600 over the course of three months, and each month pays the balance in full, the average balance will be recorded as \\$500 (i.e. any preliminary balances before the maximum are not taken into account, neither is the final balance of zero)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a43e31e6-f56e-4cdb-9baa-cd55d67562d6","_uuid":"415daa659f7d4f84ce5830455cde2efb876568d5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> ## Project set-up"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3c170739-fa9c-f03b-8d5f-6d19acd40f54","scrolled":true,"_uuid":"027ee68a24219a183bbfe15850259cf3b061572c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n%matplotlib inline\n\ncol_list = ['#005f9a', '#00CDCD', '#f1bdbf']\nsns.set_palette(col_list)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aae3e270-c228-240c-7941-4104d2b5b0b0","_uuid":"6133db5b215fafa5a8da6bfdb35120505f69c68c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"credit_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/Credit.csv\", index_col=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f700c922-666a-4dde-87ed-c44f2dd29f4d","_uuid":"41a1928328e8979733d7d62a2822b28a38ad4727"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The categorical variables should be converted into the appropriate data type.

This data includes around 10,000 full-length books and their associated genres obtained from GoodReads. \n\nIn this notebook, I clean and preprocess the text of each book in the dataset, filter out books with insufficient length or genre tags, and then convert the text via several different feature-engineering techniques and, after fitting the several new datasets obtained from the previous step to several machine-learning algorithms, I compare the results with the intention of evaluating different eature-engineering techniques and how they affect a machine-learning algorithms' performance in predicting multi-label targets.\n\nThe overall objective of this notebook is to compare two common methods for feature engineering text against several novel feature-engineering methods. The task is unique in this objective as well as in the endeavor to create multi-label classifiers on such a dataset, i.e., predict one or more genres for a given text where, in this case, the text is an entire book! Following are descriptions of the feature engineering methods referred to:\n1. [spaCy's](https://spacy.io/) document vectorization.\n- spaCy creates a vector of a word or document based on a pretrained language model. In my case, I'll be using the `en_core_web_lg` model which breaks down to an English, Web-data trained, large model. The vectorized form of a document or word attempts to encapsulate the meaning of the word or document based on word semantic and meaning relationships, e.g., the vectors for words whose meanings are related, like 'dog' and 'canine', will depict such relationship via the vector similarities. spaCy is an incredible tool in this regard and makes such vectorization easy to implement.\n2. [Sklearn's TF-IDF vectorizor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html)\n- Scikit learn, or Sklearn, provides a method for transforming preprocessed text to a term frequency-inverse document frequency vectorized model. For more information on this method, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf.\n3. Novel techniques\n- Part of speech relative frequencies.\n- Reading complexity scores obtained via 3 well-established algorithms implemented through [textstat](https://pypi.org/project/textstat/).\n\n-\n\n*I'd like to thank the following for their contributions to the libraries used in this notebook.*\n- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)\n- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>\n\n# 1.

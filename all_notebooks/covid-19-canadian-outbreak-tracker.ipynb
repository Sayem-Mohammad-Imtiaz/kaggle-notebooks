This challenge presents a curated collection of datasets from 20 global sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by a global frontline of healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers.\n\n**Dataset Description**\n\nThis dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. It includes data on a wide variety of potentially powerful statistics and indicators, like local and national infection rates, global social distancing policies, geospatial data on movement of people, and more.\n\n**Challenge Details**\n\nThe tasks associated with this dataset were developed and evaluated by global frontline healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers. They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management.\nTo participate in this challenge, review the research questions posed in the dataset tasks and submit solutions in the form of Kaggle Notebooks.\n\nWe encourage participants to use the presented data and if needed, their own proprietary and non-proprietary datasets to create their submissions.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe goal of the UNCOVER challenge is to connect the AI community with the frontline of responders to this global crisis, therefore the Roche Data Science Coalition will be evaluating solutions and surfacing this research to experts on the following schedule:\n\nWednesday, April 22nd\nWednesday, May 6th\nWednesday, May 20th\nOn each of those dates, each task will have one submission identified as the best response to the research question posed in the task. That submission will be marked as the “accepted solution” to that task, and will be reevaluated by the next deadline against the new research contributed to that task.\n\nSubmissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis, so participants are encouraged to work publicly and collaboratively to accelerate the research available for each task. Roche Canada will be inviting the authors of accepted task submissions to present their solutions to a panel of Roche leadership for potential application and scale in various regions across the globe.\n\n**Accessing the Data**\n\nDatasets have been made available here on Kaggle and are intermittently being updated from their respective sources.\n\nYou may also access the datasets through the Namara platform to get the most up to date version of each dataset, thanks to our collaborators at ThinkData Works.\n\nDetails on the provenance of each dataset are available in the file descriptions of each folder.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nHoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) is committed to working with the global community to develop solutions to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. We believe that an important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making.\n\nTo help achieve this, we have assembled a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. We call ourselves the Roche Data Science Coalition.[](http://)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# TASK 1\n\nHere,the dataset

'85 or older'(pop85older),we divide the risk level of contraction into three categories(conseidering only maximum level of deaths)-\n1. **LOW RISK**\n3. **HIGH RISK**\n4. **SEVERE RISK**\n\n# LOW RISK\n\nIt contains population having ages between 20 to 39 in which maximum deaths(here,32) occur per 1.3 lakhs-2.5 lakhs of individuals.It means that population between age 20 to 24 exhibits 32 deaths per 2 lakh individuals of canada and then increasing the population gradually to 2.5 lakhs for individuals of age between 25 to 39.It is considered low risk as deaths are occuring at slow rate and the population is increasing gradually due to individuals having better immune systems or greater recovery rate.(graph 5,6,7,8)\n\n\n# HIGH RISK\n\n**For population group of age between 0 to 19**\n\nIt contains population having ages between 0 to 19 in which maximum deaths(here,32) occur per 1.3-1.5 lakhs of individuals.It means that population having age 0 to 4 exhibits 32 deaths per 1.5 lakhs childeren or infants of canada and then decreasing the population gradually to 1.3 lakhs for individuals between age 5 to 19.It is considered as medium risk as population starts to decline/shrink gradually as ratio increases from maximumn deaths per 1.5 lakh to maximum deaths per 1.3 lakh individuals as young people who have weaker or compromised immune system are unable to sustain the disease.(graph 1,2,3,4)\n\n**For population group of age between 40 to 59**\n\nIt contains population between ages 40 to 59 in which maximum deaths occur(here,32) per 2.0 lakhs-2.1 lakhs of individuals.The population when transitioning from low risk category(i.e population upto 2.5 lakhs till age 39)decreases at a faster rate and drops down to maximum deaths per 2.1 lakhs for age 40 to 44 and decrease the ratio further to maximum deaths per 2.0 lakhs of indiviuals between age 45 to 59.It can happen as the immune system gets weaker as the age progresses or due to presence of any other disease thereby causing individuals succumbing to the disease.(graph 9,10,11,12)\n\n# SEVERE RISK\n\nIt contains population above 60 years of age which has the worst ratio of 32 deaths per 1.8lakhs-70 thousand individuals.Here population between 60 to 74 causes gradually decrease and after that sharp decrease of population is observed i.e. exhibiting maximum deaths per 70000 individuals.It is due to old age population having weaker immune system.(graph 13,14,15,16,17,18)\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#converting

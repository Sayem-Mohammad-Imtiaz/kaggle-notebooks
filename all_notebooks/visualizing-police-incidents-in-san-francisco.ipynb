It includes details such as category of the incident (e.g. Assault, Theft, etc.), a more detailed description of the incident, resolution of the incident(e.g. the person was arrested), date/time of the incident, and a rough address where the incident took place.\n\nOn its own, the provided data set would allow us for example to analyze police incidents by perhaps aggregating the incidents by category and study its distribution over various time ranges.\n\nHowever, and crucially, the data includes exact coordinates (longitude, latitude) of the police incident. This opens up **a lot** of avenues for EDA/Modelling/Visualization!\n\nIf we can find geospatial data that describes the boundaries of geographical areas, we can analyze these police incidents at a very finely granular level with respect to its geography. Moreover we can potentially connect this data to other rich data sources by linking to the applicable geographic subdivision.\n\nLucky for us, the government of San Francisco has a very large public data repository. We will use this by downloading so-called *shapefiles* containing geographical boundaries for each census tract in San Francisco. A census tract is one of the smallest subdivisions for which data is collected in the United States. Over at the US Census website there are truly enormous amounts of data broken down by census tract that, once we know the census tract for each police incident, could greatly inform our analysis. For now, though, all we need is:\n1. The Police Incidents in SF data (it's here on kaggle!)\n2. A shapefile containing all the census tracts of San Francisco (from data.sf.gov)\n3. A shapefile containing all the neighborhoods of San Francisco (optional; I use this to showcase the map-making capabilities; also from data.sf.gov)\n\n### Goals\n\n* Creating geospatial dataframes with the help of **geopandas**\n* Performing spatial joins of two dataframes\n* Creating some cool maps with **geoplot**!\n\nLet's start by importing the required libraries:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"15eb603ec64bcac233d69eba668d262febc06984"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# handles geodata\nimport geopandas as gp\n# converts coordinate pairs into points that can be interpreted by geopandas\nfrom shapely.geometry import Point\n# map plotting\nimport geoplot as gplt\nimport geoplot.crs as gcrs\n# geoplot is based on cartopy\nimport cartopy\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e4352a34a6955c97c932de31c86e05a177fdec35"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing Shapefiles as Geodataframes\n\nNext, we load the census tract boundaries into a *geodataframe* which, quite intuitively, is the *spatial* equivalent of a regular pandas dataframe."},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e3a3453675db05571af942ba2929e347cf64ea60"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# reading the shapefile\nsftracts = gp.read_file(\"../input/shapefiles-for-sf/sf_tracts_and_neighborhoods.dbf\")\n\n# we don't need these columns in this notebook\nsftracts.drop(columns=[\"geoid\", \"shape_area\", \"shape_len\"], inplace=True)\n\n# setting the census tract ID as index will make map creation easier later on!\nsftracts.set_index(\"tractce10\", inplace=True)\n\nsftracts.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fd06a53207cb8d68c2d78c384899417207cc95de"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looks almost like a plain dataframe with one obvious exception.

Fortunately, I will later show that there is a way to avoid this intermediate step, as geoplot will handle it automatically. For illustrative purposes we will create our first map \"by hand\". You will also find that when using some more involved aggregation schemes (as opposed to just counting, for instance), the method of manually aggregating the data and then plotting the map based on that aggregated data, can be significantly more performant.\n\nThat annoyance aside, we can now visualize this data by creating a map, which as you'll surely agree in a moment is surprisingly simple.\nHere, we will create a map that colors each census tract by the number of incidents. We can use any color palette contained in matplotlib.\n\nWe start with an axis object created by the *geoplot.polyplot()* function. The polyplot function simply plots all the shapes that we provide as an argument to the function. In this case, we want to draw the census tract boundaries contained in *sftracts.geometry*. \n\nBefore we do this, I'd like to talk just a little bit about map projections!\n\n### Quick Aside: Map Projections\n\nWe will also provide the *projection* argument to specify the map projection. The map projection determines how the surface of our globe (which obviously is a three-dimensional object) is projected onto a two-dimensional plane (the map). It is mathematically impossible to project a map without some form of distortion, and there are always trade-offs between the types of distortion (e.g. area, shapes, distance and direction). To illustrate the differences, here are some possible options we can choose. They are all plotted with *cartopy*. Geoplot is a high-level implementation of cartopy."},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ee1f34cc55e1560e01e0f8d78d52544aacd5e7d4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn-white\")\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,10))\nfig.suptitle(\"Various Map Projections\", fontweight=\"bold\", fontsize=20)\n\nax1 = plt.subplot(221, projection=ccrs.Mollweide())\nax1.coastlines()\nax1.stock_img()\nax1.set_anchor(\"N\")\nax1.set_title(\"Mollweide Projection\", fontweight=\"bold\")\n\nax2=plt.subplot(222,projection=ccrs.Mercator())\nax2.coastlines()\nax2.stock_img()\nax2.set_anchor(\"N\")\nax2.set_title(\"Mercator Projection\", fontweight=\"bold\")\n\nax3 = plt.subplot(223, projection=ccrs.InterruptedGoodeHomolosine())\nax3.coastlines()\nax3.stock_img()\nax3.set_anchor(\"N\")\nax3.set_title(\"Goode Homolosine Projection\", fontweight=\"bold\")\n\nax4 = plt.subplot(224, projection=ccrs.AlbersEqualArea())\nax4.coastlines()\nax4.stock_img()\nax4.set_anchor(\"N\")\nax4.set_title(\"Albers Equal Area Projection\", fontweight=\"bold\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"373a24d2d42953fa6391138648f80a96a952f1a3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These are just a small subset of the possible options, each with its set of advantages and disadvantages depending on the intended use of the map.

The Mercator projection also would have worked well for local-scale maps (for world maps it is a pretty bad, though often used, choice).\n\n### Creating a Map of the Census Tract Boundaries - geoplot.polyplot()\n\nBack to our actual objective: mapping crime data!\n\nThis first map will eventually consist of two layers. Our first layer are the census tract boundaries, which we will draw with the geoplot.polyplot() function, as mentioned and explained in detail above. We have our geometric information and we settled on the appropriate map projection.

For this step, all we really needed were the shapes (in this case census tract boundaries) stored in the shapefile. Drawing this simple map would have already involved quite a bit of busywork in cartopy (advantage: you have full control over everything). For example, geoplot automatically sets the extents of the map and centers it based on the shapes provided. Most annoyingly we would have had to re-project the coordinates in our geodataframe, since the way cartopy works with coordinate systems is slightly different from geopandas.\n\nNow we draw another layer on top of this map, which will color the census tracts by the number of police incidents. The function for this job will be *geoplot.choropleth()*.\n\n### Coloring Census Tracts by Drug-Related Police Incidents - geoplot.choropleth()\n\nThis function needs a geodataframe (the aggregated police data), a map projection, the variable to color by (the number of police incidents), and how many bins of data there should be (passing *None* creates a continuous colormap). We then layer this map on top of the map we created just before.\n\n**Note**: Throughout this notebook, when I am aggregating police incidents, I will count every person involved in the incident as a separate case. To illustrate, if two persons rob a store and get arrested, I will count this as two incidents. If you disagree with this approach, your aggregation function should incorporate unique Incident IDs."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a18312b48a24199da2c0536d198c9208ff17f8bc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = gplt.choropleth(drug_inc_by_tract, projection=gcrs.LambertConformal(), hue=\"Incidents\",\n                     cmap=\"magma_r\", k=None, linewidth=0, figsize=(10,8), legend=True)\ngplt.polyplot(sftracts.geometry, projection = gcrs.LambertConformal(), edgecolor=\"k\",\n              linewidth=1, ax=ax)\nax.set_title(\"2015 SF Police Incidents by Census Tract\\nCategory: Drug/Narcotic\",\n             fontweight=\"bold\", fontsize=16)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"51429ee1ce4c5acb726d2315c4371f9a637ec2d7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Maps can be super effective visualizations of data.

It has a host of functions that help us quickly make sense of a large amount of text data! Some of the basic terminology associated with the NLTK library is as follows - \n \n1. **Corpus** - This is just the text string. It could be one line long or a 100 lines long.\n2. **Tokens** - Tokens are just the words appearing in a text string. For instance, in the string \"I like New York\" we have 4 tokens - \"I\", \"like\", \"New\" and \"York\". Although this can be done using a simple split, NLTK has functions that tokenize rapidly especially if we have a lot of text in a huge dataframe!\n3. **Vocabulary** - This is the entire collection of all tokens found in a corpus!\n4. **Parts of Speech** - Going back to basic English classes, every sentence has words that belong to some part of speech. There are verbs, nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, etc. NLTK has the `pos_tagger` function that allows us to quickly tag parts of speech to a string. You might be thinking if its any good at it and I can tell you that it is!\n5. **Stop Words** - Stop words are english words such as \"i\", \"me\", \"myself\" which although add sense to a sentence, contribute nothing towards making it special enough to be of significance in a prediction problem."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2266c8481c4b1a8a66f306a9341c5df22b4f9e78"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in the train_rev1 datafile downloaded from kaggle\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/Train_rev1.csv')\ndf.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3439be841283d51122ad6c1c1832c0a9efbffca3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Data Shape:\", df.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a9b3cd49cbecd2d371d0a5763126e4b7e47df178"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data that we have has around 240k rows and 12 columns.

The basic fundamentals for this algorithm derive from the Naive Bayes Theorem which states (mathematically) - \n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nFor our problem, we have to predict a class given a vector of predictors. The above formula becomes - \n\n$$P(Class|Vector) = \\frac{P(Vector|Class)*P(Class)}{P(Vector)}$$\n\nThe final choice of the class between two classes (in our case, high or low salary), is based on which probability is higher - \n\n$$P(Class = High Salary|Vector)$$  vs $$P(Class = Low Salary|Vector)$$\n\nSince the probability of the Vector $P(Vector)$ remains the same for both calculations, we ignore it. So, in essence we have to find the RHS of the equation -  \n$$P(Class|Vector) \\propto P(Vector|Class)*P(Class)$$\n\nThe $P(Class)$ is just the probability that a class appears, given by - \n$$\\frac{Number of rows with that Class}{Total Rows}$$\n\nSometimes, because the product $$P(Vector|Class)*P(Class)$$ can get really small, we take the log of the expression to calculate - \n$$log(P(Vector|Class)*P(Class))$$\n\nand then compare these values for both classes for a document (or job description)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0fd2fa57fad2a207118d530479a8b604adec8d44"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Two types of Naive Bayes Algorithms\nWe understood that essentially a naive bayes problem boils down to calculating the following probability - \n$$P(Vector|Class)$$\n\nThere are two approaches to get here and this gives rise to bernoulli naive bayes and multinomial naive bayes. The difference is subtle and has to do with how we represent our data. \n\n### Bernoulli Naive Bayes -\nFor Bernoulli Naive Bayes each column in the dataset has to be a 1 or 0 type variable. If we speak about only job description data, we can say that for each term in a job description (where each term is a unique column of my dataframe), I will have either a 0 or a 1 depending on whether a word is present in my document or not. Lets say I have the following training data, categorising documents as belonging to either the 'Sport' class or the 'Informatics' class.\n\n| Document ID | goal | tutor | variance | speed | drink | defence | performance | field | Class       |\n|-------------|------|-------|----------|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|\n| 1           | 1    | 0     | 0        | 0     | 1     | 1       | 1           | 1     | Sport       |\n| 2           | 0    | 0     | 1        | 0     | 1     | 1       | 0           | 0     | Sport       |\n| 3           | 0    | 1     | 0        | 1     | 0     | 1       | 1           | 0     | Sport       |\n| 4           | 1    | 0     | 0        | 1     | 0     | 1       | 0           | 1     | Sport       |\n| 5           | 1    | 0     | 0        | 0     | 1     | 0       | 1           | 1     | Sport       |\n| 6           | 0    | 0     | 1        | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1           | 1     | Sport       |\n| 7           | 0    | 1     | 1        | 0     | 0     | 0       | 1           | 0     | Informatics |\n| 8           | 1    | 1     | 0        | 1     | 0     | 0       | 1           | 1     | Informatics |\n| 9           | 0    | 1     | 1        | 0     | 0     | 1       | 0           | 0     | Informatics |\n| 10          | 0    | 0     | 0        | 0     | 0     | 0       | 0           | 0     | Informatics |\n| 11          | 0    | 0     | 1        | 0     | 1     | 0       | 1           | 0     | Informatics |\n\nand I want to classify these two documents - \n\n| Document ID | goal | tutor | variance | speed | drink | defence | performance | field | Class |\n|-------------|------|-------|----------|-------|-------|---------|-------------|-------|-------|\n| 12          | 1    | 0     | 0        | 1     | 1     | 1       | 0           | 1     | ?     |\n| 13          | 0    | 1     | 1        | 0     | 1     | 0       | 1           | 0     | ?     |\n<br> \n\n\nFor the above example we get - \n$P(Sport) = \\frac{6}{11}$, $P(Informatics) = \\frac{5}{11}$.

Intuitively, this says that a description can be of a particular class both by what words it has and also by what words it doesnt have!

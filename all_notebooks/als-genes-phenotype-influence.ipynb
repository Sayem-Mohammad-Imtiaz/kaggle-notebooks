Genetic terminology. Methods Mol Biol. 2012;850:1-9. doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_1\n\n\"Common terms used in genetics with multiple meanings are explained and the terminology used in subsequent chapters is defined. Statistical Human Genetics has existed as a discipline for over a century, and during that time the meanings of many of the terms used have evolved, largely driven by molecular discoveries, to the point that molecular and statistical geneticists often have difficulty understanding each other. It is therefore imperative, now that so much of molecular genetics is becoming an in silico and statistical science, that the authors have well-defined, common terminology.\"\n\n**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Gene Concept</span>**\n\n\"The concept of a gene (the word itself was introduced by Bateson) is due to Mendel, who used the German word “Factor”. Mendel used the word in the same way that we might call “hot” and “cold” factors, not in the way that we call “temperature” a factor. In other words, his Factor was the level of what statisticians now call a factor. In the original terminology, still used by some population geneticists, genes occur in pairs on homologous chromosomes. In this terminology the four blood groups A, B, O and AB (defined in terms of agglutination reactions) are determined by three (allelic) genes: A, B and O.\"\n\n\"Nowadays molecular geneticists do not call these three factors genes, but rather “alleles”, defined as “alternative forms” of a gene that can occur at the same locus, or place, in the genome. Whereas Drosophila geneticists used to talk of two loci for a gene, and human geneticists used to talk of two genes at a locus, modern geneticists talk of “two alleles of a gene” or “two alleles at a locus”; this last, which is nowadays so common, is the terminology that will thus be used in this book. It then follows (rather awkwardly) that two alleles at the same locus are allelic to each other, whereas two alleles that are at different loci are non-allelic to each other. A gene is commonly defined as a DNA sequence that has a function, meaning a class of similar DNA sequences all involved in the same particular molecular function, such as the formation of the ABO red cell antigens. (Note the common illogical use of the phrase “cloning genes” by molecular geneticists when, by their own terminology, “cloning alleles” is meant). Some restrict the word gene to protein-coding genes, but there are many more sequences of DNA that have function by virtue of being transcribed to RNA without ever being translated to DNA and protein-coding, so this restricted definition of a gene would appear to be unwarranted.”.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450815/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsgenescsv/genes.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-2\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf.dataframeName = 'genes.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Gene, allele, locus, site</span>**\n\n\"A locus is the location on the genome of a gene, such as the “ABO gene”. By any definition a gene must involve more than one nucleotide base pair. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) thus do not occur at loci, but rather in and around loci, and in this book we shall not write SNP markers as being “at” loci. Because of the confusion that occurs when SNPs are described as occurring at loci, some use the term “gene-locus”, but we shall always use the term locus for the location of a functional gene. We shall, however, allow SNP markers to have alleles and use the original term for their locations: “sites” within loci or, more generally, sites within the region of a locus or anywhere in the genome.\"\n\n\"If in the population only one allele occurs at a site or locus, we shall say that it is monomorphic, or monoallelic, in that population. If two alleles occur, as is common for SNPs, we shall use the original term diallelic which, apart from having precedence, is etymologically sounder than the now commonly used term biallelic. If many alleles occur, we shall describe the polymorphism as polyallelic or multiallelic (the former term is arguably more logical, the latter more common). When there are just two alleles at a locus, the one with the smaller population frequency is called the minor allele. In genetics, the term allele\" “frequency”--which is strictly speaking a count--is used to mean relative frequency, i.e. the proportion of all such alleles at that locus among the members of a population; thus the term minor allele frequency is often used for diallelic markers.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450815/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Polymorphism, Mutation</span>**\n\n\"The A, B, O and AB blood types comprise a polymorphism, in the sense that they are alternative phenotypes that commonly occur in the population. A polymorphic locus was originally defined operationally as a polymorphism-determining locus at which the least common allele occurs with a “frequency” of at least 1%; but a more appropriate definition would be a locus at which the most common allele occurs with a “frequency” of at most 99%. Different alleles arise at a locus as a result of mutation, or sudden change in the genetic material.\"\n\n\"Mutation is a relatively rare event, caused for example by an error in replication. Thus all alleles are by origin mutant alleles, and a genetic polymorphism was conceived of as a locus at which the frequency of the least common allele has a frequency too large to be maintained in the population solely by recurrent mutation.\"\n\n\"Many authors now use the term mutation for any rare allele, and the term polymorphism for any common allele.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450815/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genes</span>**"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"Gene\"].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Allelic association, linkage disequilibrium, gametic phase disequilibrium</span>**\n\n\"If the alleles at one locus are not distributed in the population independently of the alleles at another locus, the two loci exhibit allelic association. If this association is a result of a mixture of subpopulations (such as ethnicities or religious groups) within each of which there is random mating, the association is often denoted as “spurious”. In such a case there is true association, but the cause is not of primary genetic interest. If the association is not due to this kind of population structure, it is either due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) or gametic phase disequilibrium (GPD); in the former case the loci are linked, i.e. they co-segregate in families, in the latter case they are not linked, i.e. they segregate independently in families. Owing to an unintended original definition, loci that are not linked have often been mistakenly described as being in LD.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4450815/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"Associated_ND\"].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"Associated_ND\"].value_counts().plot.bar(color=['blue', 'red','lime','purple'], title='ALS Associated ND Genes');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"ALSgeneScanner is a pipeline designed for the analysis of NGS data of ALS patients.

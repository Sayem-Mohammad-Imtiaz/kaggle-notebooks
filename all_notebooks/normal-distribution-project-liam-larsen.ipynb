The data should be quantitative,\nwhich means that it should be measured using numbers. You can be as creative as\nyouâ€™d like, but here are some suggestions for things that you can survey.\n\n - the heights of a large number of people\n - the number of pages in a set of books on a bookshelf\n - the number of hits earned by different professional baseball players\n   in a season\n\nPart 2\n------\n\nCreate a visual representation of your data. If the data is continuous, use a\nhistogram. If the data is discrete, use a bar graph. Make sure to label the axes with\nappropriate titles and incorporate the appropriate scale on each axis.\n\nPart 3\n------\n\nRespond to the following questions.\n\n 1. What are the mean and standard deviation of the set of data?\n 2. Does the data follow a normal distribution? Be sure to mathematically justify\nyour answer.\n 3. Answer one of the following questions.\na. If your sample follows a normal distribution, does this makes sense to\nyou? Explain why.\nb.

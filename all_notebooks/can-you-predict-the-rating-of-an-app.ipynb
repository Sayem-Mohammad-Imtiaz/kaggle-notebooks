{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nOne of my friends suggested that I look into this dataset to see if we can predict the rating of an app with given data. In addition, I wanted to do a simple hypothesis testing to see if games perform better than other categories of apps. To try and predict the ratings, I decided to use simple regressions. Also, since the full version of the data has more data points, I ended up using it over the 32k data. \n\nIn the end, what I found was that the given data is not enough. General data such as the category or the number of reviews are not good predictors. I assume that better predictors would be data that evaluates user experience. For example, average number of times the user opens the app a day or a week, average number of minutes spent in the app per day, etc. When it comes to the hypothesis testing, I found that games do not really perform better than games.

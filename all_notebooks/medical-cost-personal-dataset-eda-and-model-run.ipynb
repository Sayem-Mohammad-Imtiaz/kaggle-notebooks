policyholders are roughly evenly distributed among 4 regions, namely southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest, with southeast region having a slightly larger population.\n5. **children**: The dataset are divided into 6 categories regarding number of dependents they covered in their policies,with the min number of children being 0 and the max being 5. Most of the people do not have any dependents. The population tend to decrease in size with increasing number of dependents.\n6. **bmi**: BMI is following a normal distribution(having a bell-shaped population with a mean of 31) Value of BMI score is ranging from 15 to 53.\n7. **charges**: Charges in this dataset are ranging from 1122 to 63770 dollars with the mean of 13270.

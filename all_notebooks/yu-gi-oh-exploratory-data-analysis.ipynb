Trading Card Game. In addition to looking at the overall picture, I will be interested to find if there are any trends amongst certain attributes and monster types. In a later notebook, I hope to build Machine Learning models to make predicitons about a card's properties.\n\nThe data used here was originally imported from the [YGOHub](https://www.ygohub.com) API, which seems to contain lots of the information I will need for this project. Since Kaggle doesn't allow importing of this kind, I did it locally & made a dataset to upload [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xagor1/ygo-data).\n\nDuring this process, I ran into a few problems. \n\nFirstly, cards with & or # in their name were not correctly listed in the API, so are missing. This only covers about 35 cards, <1% of the total, so I don't expect it to have too drastic an effect on the trends in the data, or the power of predictive models. These missing entries can possibly be obtained from the YGOPrices API, or another dataset I found her on Kaggle. However, both require cleaning, and modifications to bring them up to the detail contained here. Progress so far on this matter can be [found here](https://www.kaggle.com/xagor1/cleaning-yu-gi-oh-data/notebook). Due to the low number of cards involved, I'm not planning on expending too much effort on the problem.\n\nSecondly, it's likely slightly out of date, and won't contain all the most recent releases, since the API doesn't seem to have been updated in a little while. This will only get worse as new cards are released.\n\nNext, some columns, like releases, require further cleaning to be useful.\n\nIn the end, I have nearly 6000 monster entries, which is more than enough to work with for now."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"64c3f7e61be4a73728c366abc5dbedcd63ab9e72"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setting Up\n\nBefore doing any Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we need to load the data.

This will simply look value counts and proportions across various categories, to get a feel for the data.\n\nFirst of all, what data do we actually have?\n\n* Name: The name of the card. This could potentially be useful for building a predictive model, if used with NLP. For example, a lot of Warrior cards might contain Warrior in their name, or a similar word, like Samurai or Knight.\n* Attack: The attack of the card. Varies between 0 and 5,000.\n* Attribute: The attribute of the card. Covers the four classical elements, Earth, Wind, Water and Fire, along with Light, Dark and Divine.\n* Defense: The defense of the card. Varies between 0 and 5,000.\n* has_materials: Whether the card needs materials for their summon (Xyz, Synchro etc)\n* has_name_condition: Whether the card has a special condition related to its name.\n* is_extra_deck: Whether the card is found in the Extra deck. This is a catchall for Fusion, Xyz, Synchro etc\n* is_fusion: Whether the card is a fusion or not.\n* is_link: Whether the card is a Link monster or not.\n* is_pendulum: Whether the card is a pendulum or not.\n* is_synchro: Whether the card is a Synchro or not.\n* is_xyz: Whether the card is an Xyz or not.\n* link_markers: The position of a card's link markers.\n* link_number: The card's link number.\n* materials: If a card does need materials to summon, these are the materials required.\n* monster_types: The type(s) of card. Such as Normal, Effect, Fusion, Flip etc.\n* name_condition: What the card's name condition is.\n* number: The passcode on the card.\n* pendulum_left: The value of the left pendulum scale.\n* pendulum_right: The value of the right pendulum scale.\n* pendulum_text: The pendulum effect of the card (if it has one)\n* releases: When a card was released.\n* Type: The Type of the card, such as Machine, Warrior etc.\n* stars: How many Levels or Ranks a card has.\n* text: The card's effect or flavour text.\n\nThe easiest place to start, is the 3 numerical values most obvious when looking at a card, the attack, defense and stars (level / rank). These give you a very rough feeling for the power of the card, without considering its effect. Of course, without the effect considered, you don't get the full picture.\n\nSince attack & defense both contain NANs due to unusual characters, I will encode these as -1 for now. A value of zero could also work, but I want a way to tell them apart from the true zero cases. Link monsters for example do not have a defense stat. For stars, I will fill the NANs with zeros, since they literally do not have stars, and it's an unused value.\n\nOther numerical fearures worth considering might include the Link Number, the Pendulum scales and the Number (or Passcode), but I suspect the latter is meaningless. The majority of monsters are not Link, so I will encode NANs as zero. For the pendulum scales, scales of zero do actually exist, so I will encode them as -1. In both cases, these will then be excluded from my plots. For number, a few monsters do genuinely not have a passcode, so I will encode those values as zero.\n\nBefore doing some graphical EDA, we can take a very quick look at summary statistics for Attack, Defense & Stars. Whilst thier overall range is the same, in general, Attack is slightly higher than Defense, with mean and median values of ~1500, compared to 1200. This is likely because the game generally favours aggressive over defensive play. These values are close to baseline values found for monsters with a level of less than 4. Given that you generally need monsters with a level of 4 or under to start playing the game, it's no surprise that the mean & media level is approximately 4."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5b839ae390e135f1b8979526b3beb0175414a03c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"YGO_df.attack.fillna(-1,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.defense.fillna(-1,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.stars.fillna(0,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.link_number.fillna(0,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.pendulum_left.fillna(-1,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.pendulum_right.fillna(-1,inplace=True)\nYGO_df.number.fillna(0,inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"08dbd1cc3bd526a27acdd328856277d9e85b504d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"YGO_df[['attack','defense','stars']].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fa018a21fe49c8d18d924144935637b24b730c83"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Attack\n\nFirst of all, let's look at Attack. If we just look at individual value counts, we see that the most common attack value is actually zero. I knew that monsters with powerful or unusual effects often had zero attack to counteract this fact, but didn't realise it was the most common value in the game.\n\nThe next several most common values all fall below 2000, so within a range you would expect for Level 1-4 cards. 1000, 1800, 1600, 1500, 1200, and 800 are all values that feel familiar to me as a long time Yu-Gi-Oh! player, and can imagine as baselines for the different levels, or for certain types of effects.\n\nThe value of 2000 follows next, which is very common for level 5s, for example. Most of the remaining common values fall below 2000, with a few exceptions, 2400, 2500 and 3000. 2400 is very common for tribute monsters with effects, such as the Monarchs, and 2500 and 3000 are iconic values within the history of the game.\n\nI was slightly surprised by quite how common my -1 placeholder was.\n\nThe rarest values are either non-hundreds (i.e. XX50, XX10) or above 3000.

Naively, you would expect that as attack increases, so too does defense. However, if you know Yu-Gi-Oh!, you'd know that often a high value in one stat is offset by a low value in the other, unless it's a particularly powerful card. Since there is a lot of overlap between data points, rather than just show a regular scatterplot, the points have been colour coded based on the density at that value.\n\nThere is a roughly linear relationship between attack and defense, with the largest density of points approximately along attack = defense. However, many points also lie outside this range, with a huge spread of values, covering most possible combinations up to 3,000 attack/defense. The data outside this range is sparser, with values above 3,000 (The attack of Blue Eyes White Dragon), traditionally reserved for special and extra powerful monsters.\n\nIt's also noticeable that many points lie along the axes, where one value is zero, and the other can reach as high as 5,000. There are particularly dense regions around 0 attack with 2000 defense, and 1,500 to 2,000 attack, with 0 defense. This is likely due to common design choices seen for level 4 and under monsters. It's not unusual for these monsters to completely forego one stat for a strong value in the other. Meaning a monster that can protect you, but can't attack the opponent, or a strong attacker, that is worthless on defense.\n\nThe densest points lie below 2,000 attack/ defense, particularly around 0/0 and 1600/1000-1200. As mentioned before, many monsters with powerful effects have no natural attack or defense, to counterbalance this. The latter values just feel familiar as a Yu-Gi-Oh! player, with defense usually skewing slightly lower than attack.\n\nAnother denser region is seen around 2400/2000, which is a very common value for level 5/6 monsters, such as Jinzo, or the Monarchs."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"31cce18b7078311cddfd479c001496a9d94d9010"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Function for mapping density to colours\ndef makeColours( vals ):\n    colours = np.zeros( (len(vals),3) )\n    norm = Normalize( vmin=vals.min(), vmax=vals.max() )\n\n    #Can put any colormap you like here.\n    colours = [cm.ScalarMappable( norm=norm, cmap='jet').to_rgba( val ) for val in vals]\n\n    return colours","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c652e2162c7a61fecd74ccbdc7a5a0300002b671","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Scatter Plot of Attack vs Defense\ndensObj = kde([YGO_df.attack,YGO_df.defense])\n\ncolours = makeColours( densObj.evaluate([YGO_df.attack,YGO_df.defense]) )\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,12))\n_=plt.scatter('attack','defense',data=YGO_df,color=colours,s=50)\n_=plt.xlabel('Attack',fontsize=25)\n_=plt.ylabel('Defense',fontsize=25)\n_=plt.title('Attack Vs Defense')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"84df50e429fbb33496c5a666b0c23972c3cae4ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similarly, a scatterplot of Attack vs Stars (Level or Rank) shows an approximately linear relationship between the two, with a large spread towards the axis.

The 2nd most common value is zero, which as mentioned earlier, is due to powerful or interesting effects being counterbalanced by weak stats.\n\nHistorically, 2,000 was the cut-off defense for Level 4 monsters without effects, but this has gradually crept up over time, with effect monsters now found with this high defense. There are also contributions from Level 5/6 monsters, which commonly have 2,000 defense.\n\nThe next common values are all below 2,000, and will feel familiar to Yu-Gi-Oh! players, even if they aren't sure why, such as 1,200, 800 and 1,500. It's a while before we see any values above 2,000, and in fact monsters without a Defense stat are actually more common. The first we find is 2,500, which is historically tied to boss monsters like the Blue Eyes White Dragon, and Attack values of 3,000.\n\nAs with Attack, non-hundreds values, and values above 3,000 are very rare."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3cc36cceba952972f7136f93e11a1b6f5452c511"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Plot of value counts for Defense\nax=YGO_df.defense.value_counts().plot.bar(figsize=(25,10),rot=90,\n                                                   title='Value counts for Monster Defense')\n_=ax.set(xlabel='Defense',ylabel='Count')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6fed51278fcc089eaee47c920f60605f1dcfc361"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Overall trends look similar to those found for Attack, but skewed slightly lower.

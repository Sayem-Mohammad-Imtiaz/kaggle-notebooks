So in my previous [kernel](http://www.kaggle.com/mhajabri/what-do-kagglers-say-about-data-science), I restricted my income analysis to US Data Scientists and , as I explained there, the reason why I did so is that comparing wages across countries can be misleading and actually false.\nThe main problem that arises is the fact that **the cost of living** is not the same for every country. As a consequence to that, the wages we get after converting to the same currency using market exchange rates are different from one another.\n\nIn this kernel, I'll try to show you how you can analyze income data when the respondents come from differents countries and we'll see who are the most valued data scientists in different parts of the world. After that, we'll use the adjusted incomes from part 1 and the insights from part 2 to build a ML model that predicts the income of a Kaggler Data Scientist.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"98bc0f97-d64d-4f72-8175-725542b679c8","_uuid":"898bf2d1c9b1d3a0a74cd52780242b9e71d5fa4c"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Table of contents\n\n* [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) for dummies](#ppp)\n* [PPP-Adjusted Kagglers' incomes ](#adjusted)\n* [How valued are Data Scientists across the world](#valuation)\n* [What makes a Data Scientist valuable for each country](#properties)\n   * [Most valuated ML methods](#methods)\n   * [Most valuated DS tools](#tools)\n   * [Most valuated job titles](#titles)\n   * [Most valuated job functions](#functions)\n* [Income prediction across the world using xgboost](#xgboost)\n    * [Feature engineering](#features)\n    * [Prediction and scores](#prediction)\n    * [Analysis of the results](#analysis)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ba856bac-4df2-46ad-abc9-9162a91a1a24","_uuid":"837714bc95a40430d60b24cf00e2ed2b573a1a96"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(color_codes=True)\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_log_error as MSLE\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c4d3b843-af56-41d3-812f-b2ec32815541","_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"925f999bf1487a2d6e49cb994999a26b38b36aef"}},{"source":"# What's Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) ?\n<a id=\"ppp\"></a>\n***","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"45e6af93-5d54-432a-a1e6-9c4ea3ca35b6","_uuid":"8355e48a4ec17c02e29d7a2346a405b78ae13881"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"When you're traveling across the country you live in, you notice that prices for food, rent and common goods vary from one city to another. This happens in a much larger scale when changing countries !      \nLet's take an example : Consider 1 USD, Google tells you that it equals 64.92 Indian Rupee. An average dinner in the US may cost you 10-12 USD which corresponds to 640-760 INR. But in fact, it appears that you could get yourself a good meal with 150-200INR in India. In other words : **You can do with 1USD in India more than what you would do with 1USD in the US.**\n\nAs a basic example, let's say we find that 1USD in India = 3USD in the US, that would mean that if you get paid 3000 USD in India you would lead the same someone would be leading in the US if he's getting paid 9000 USD.\n\nHere comes the **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP from now on)** : Faced with this problematic of different costs of livings, economists came up with a ratio to convert currencies without using market exchange rates. To do so, they select a **basket of goods**, say orange/Milk/tomato ..., and check its value in the USD and in the country they're interested in.     \nLet's say they find that : \n* Value of the basket in the US = 10 USD\n* Value of the basket in India = 200 INR        \n\nThen they would say that **PPP(India) = 200/10 = 20**, in other words, you need 20 local currency units to get what you would get with 1 USD in the US.   \n\n**All in all,* The purchasing power of a currency refers to the quantity of the currency needed to purchase a given unit of a good, or common basket of goods and services.***","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e9a15a1e-8b06-491c-9795-f8493326b8b1","_uuid":"838f5173a6ec1815220666507f60435e4b62a008"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Kagglers incomes adjusted according to PPPs\n<a id=\"adjusted\"></a>\n***","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"93a1ee46-5ee2-44d9-9f52-a04f58cb564c","_uuid":"dc387fcbe27e2c07fdd61f31350459995f715197"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In the following, we'll convert the incomes using the PPP rates and see what happens for different countries.      \nTo get significant results, we'll only keep countries from where at least 80 respondents gave their income informations.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"90f96ec5-a66d-4b4f-9e0e-95df01560037","_uuid":"e0b832e5b37ab98d69b193e7a931caf2e03cd65f"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\n\n#We convert the salaries to numerical values and keep salaries between 1000 and 1.000.000 Local currency\ndata['CompensationAmount'] = data['CompensationAmount'].fillna(0)\ndata['CompensationAmount'] = data.CompensationAmount.apply(lambda x: 0 if (pd.isnull(x) or (x=='-') or (x==0))\n                                                       else float(x.replace(',','')))\ndf = data[(data['CompensationAmount']>1000) & (data['CompensationAmount']<2000000)]\n\n\n#We only keep the countries with more than 80 respondents to get significant results later on\ns_temp = df['Country'].value_counts()\ns_temp = s_temp[s_temp>80]\ncountries=list(s_temp.index)\ncountries.remove('Other')\ndf=df[df.Country.isin(countries)]\n","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"822e2ebd-1162-415c-9636-7ca3be6493ed","_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8187f65677884f92d822a0d5e562783dc774c723"}},{"source":"We have some missing values in the Currency column.    \nWe won't drop the rows with missing values, instead, we'll fill them with the currency of the country the respondent lives in, here's the code to do so : ","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dc80fc31-71d3-480b-bff5-c93dbb2826e1","_uuid":"75a7d81890f082cef376361e40660334f29d7c3a"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"df['CompensationCurrency'] =df.groupby('Country')['CompensationCurrency'].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.value_counts().idxmax()))","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"98e95a67-99b4-460d-98a0-2c77c32d9d31","_uuid":"6d300776ec180eff4a404776a90af1646772fb70"}},{"source":"Now, we'll provide PPP rates for the countries we kept earlier.\n> I tried to use the latest PPP rates available, you can found the PPP for each country [here](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/IND).","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"46dee4e4-c140-41d1-80be-70aeb8efce3f","_uuid":"03d03f50c1fccba626bf3abf0e18103c6afa73d8"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"#The PPP rates\nrates_ppp={'Countries':['United States','India','United Kingdom','Germany','France','Brazil','Canada','Spain','Australia','Russia','Italy',\"People 's Republic of China\",'Netherlands'],\n           'Currency':['USD','INR','GBP','EUR','EUR','BRL','CAD','EUR','AUD','RUB','EUR','CNY','EUR'],\n           'PPP':[1.00,17.7,0.7,0.78,0.81,2.05,1.21,0.66,1.46,25.13,0.74,3.51,0.8]}\n\nrates_ppp = pd.DataFrame(data=rates_ppp)\nrates_ppp\n","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"7959be49-4399-489d-bcfb-3777731a905a","_uuid":"290cb4b0837bc5bacf036e3828b1b0433c5f7a76"}},{"source":"We notice that **the currency used for each country respondents is most of the time the local currency but not always** so we can't directly use the PPP rates.    \nWhat we'll do instead is the following : \n1.

That being said, the problem is not entirely solved as the gap is still quite big comparing to the US. Why is that ? \n\nTwo main reasons : \n* **Very populated and/or developing countries often set the value of their currency to be lower than the U.S. dollar** because they want the cost of living to be lower, so that they can pay their workers less. This also mean that they are more attractive markers to big companies and investors who are interested in implementing themselves in countries where it would cost them less (Hello Apple) ! \n* **There are some limitations to PPP rates**.

At last, I wanted to see how related the income was to some features by building a predictive model and I was surprised by how good the model was.\n\n**To do list **       \nI would suggest you guys think of other features that can show the difference of perception and application of Data Science and Machine Learning across the globe; maybe the method to learn next year isn't the same for everyone for example ?      \nAlso, since the regresison model for BRIC countries gave a score not as good as the one for the US and Europe, I would suugest building a specific ML model for BRIC that would be more suited to its specifities.\n\nOf course, if you guys have any suggestions about informations I could add to this kernel or improvements to what's already here,  don't hesitate to put that in the comments section, I'd appreciate that !       \nAlso, an upvote is always welcome if you feel like the content here is worth it :)\n\nThanks for your time and see on another one fellow Kagglers ! \n","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b65c96f6-fe87-45c7-8e04-f639c1a0ae02","_uuid":"73f51b62ade224dc8e8778a2fe89ab225325a6d5"},"cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"},"file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"}}}

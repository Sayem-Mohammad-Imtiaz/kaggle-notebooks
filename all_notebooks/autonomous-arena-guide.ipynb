The images were obtained from a camera mounted in front of the car that captured the frames at 8fps. A self-built android app was used to control the car through a Bluetooth module. There were 4 major signals to maneuver the car viz. front (F), left (L), right (R), and stop (S).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype/blob/master/images/track_image1.jpg\" width=\"400px\" alt=\"track image\"/>\n\n\nWhile using this dataset please cite,\n```\n@article{AgarwalBehavioral20,\n  title={Behavioral Cloning in Autonomous Vehicle Using Deep Learning},\n  author={Aman Agarwal and Aditya Mishra and Priyanka Sharma},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\n\nSee the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/amanbasu/Autonomous-Car-Prototype) for more detail.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# read csv file\ntrackData = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/indoor-car-track/autonomous_arena.csv\")\ntrackData.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# split images and labels\nlabel = trackData[\"448\"]\nimage = trackData.drop(\"448\", axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stats"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Total samples: {}\".format(image.shape[0]))\nprint(\"Image size: 14x32\")\nprint(\"Label distribution:\")\nprint(label.value_counts())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Visualization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))\nplot = 1\nfor i in range(2):\n    for j in range(5):\n        idx = random.randint(1, image.shape[0])\n        img = image.iloc[idx].values.reshape((14,32))\n        \n        plt.subplot(2, 5, plot)\n        plt.imshow(img, cmap=\"gray\")\n        plt.title(\"Label: {}\".format(label.iloc[idx]))\n        \n        plot += 1\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

The latest spread of COVID 19 rose sales of hand sanitizers, disposable gloves and masks worldwide. It is likely that the sales volume of those items after the pandemic is over will stay at a high level, due to population awareness of virus spread mechanisms, increase fear, and new habits. While most of those items might be found in convenience stores or other retail shops, pharmacies are the most reliable places to get those items. Pharmacies offer prescription and over-the-counter medicines, required by people who got infected with COVID 19 but might not require hospitalization. Therefore, pharmacies have a clear role in the prevention of the disease and the recovery of infected individuals.\n\nThe main assumption of this work is that the larger the number of Covid Cases in a given neighborhood, the higher the need for disease prevention and palliation items. In other words, the hypothesis is that the market demand of a given neighborhood increases with the number of Covid Cases in the neighborhood. The number of existing pharmacies in each neighborhood will be used to estimate market supply. A neighborhood with a high number of COVID infections and a low number of pharmacies might be in need of new pharmacies. The number of Covid cases, existing pharmacies and distance to downtown will be analyzed for each neighborhood in Toronto to select the best neighborhoods for opening a new pharmacy."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data\n\nZip Codes and a list of Toronto neighborhoods were sourced from Wikipedia. Coordinates of Toronto neighborhoods were loaded from a csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code, available at: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data. A database for covid cases in Toronto was retrieved from the web, this database is updated weekly on Wednesdays, https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/. Foursquare was used to find out the number of existing pharmacies available in a given neighborhood. The distance of each neighborhood to downtown was calculated with a Geopy function, described in https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#module-geopy.distance.\n\nFrom the database with Covid cases in the Toronto area, only confirmed cases were selected. Confirmed cases were grouped by Zip Code. Foursquare was used to find pharmacies within a radius of 1000 m. Downtown Toronto coordinates, required to calculate the distance to downtown, correspond to the coordinates of Toronto City Hall."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np #

Kmeans clustering was used to sort the neighborhoods into 5 groups, and each group was analyzed to determine which group contains the best options for opening a new pharmacy. Neighborhoods with postal code M1B, M3N and M9V (cluster 4) had the largest number of covid cases, and the number of pharmacies was well below average, so they are the best option if the investor is willing to open it more than 16 km from downtown. The closest to downtown neighborhoods (cluster 3), had the highest amount of pharmacies, but curiously the number of Covid cases were lower than average in those neighborhoods. The market is likely saturated in those neighborhoods, so they would not be a good option. The rest of the clusters (0,1 and 2) have neighborhoods with good options to open a pharmacy, the choice will depende on whether the investors prioritizes distance to downtown, or market demand.

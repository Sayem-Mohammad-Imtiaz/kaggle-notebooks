Data science is a field that knew an increasing use in the pharmaceuticals affaires, that's why, I'm very excited to equip myself with a big set of data skills and especially data analysis which is very important in my domain since it generates huge pharma-related datasets which must be processed by a pharmacist.\n    <br>This is my LinkedIn profile : <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoocem-benamar-a38b79197/\">Hoocem</a>\n    <br>Email : benamarhoocem@gmail.com\n    <br>Phone : 00213699398988\n</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3 style=\"font-size:20px\" >Introduction :</h3>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"font-size:16px\">I am going to make a special Kaggle notebook because I'am be the first use of this notebook and seriously need this study. Since selling small services is a raising business domain, it is wise to think about investing in this market if you have a value to share.<br> Fiverr is a well known freelancing platform that I like so much and it's very interesting to hace an onverview about what's going there. I have some soft skills and Fiverr may be a good place to sell technical services but we're not sure yet let the data tell us if it worth to as a freelancer in Fiverr.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size:16px\">The dataset:</h3>\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\"><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/kirilspiridonov/freelancers-offers-on-fiverr\">The dataset</a> that I'm going to use for data analyse is a csv file with 6183 row and 7 column, where each row represents a gig (small service) and each column represents a feature, it does not contain all offers available on Fiverr but only a sumple of it. <br><br>The main goal behind this notebook is to have a clear overview about the market of Fiverr and to extract the maximum amount of informations and to help everyone who is planning to work with Fiverr in his market study by providing an explained analysis of the available date. This analysis will be to fonded on descriptive statistics concepts. Mainly I will show how quantitatif vary in the hole sample first ,then how they vary in term of each label of qualitatif or categorical valiables.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">The quantitatif variable in this dataset are :\n    <ol  style=\"font-size:14px\">\n        <li>The count (number) of gigs.</li>\n        <li>The price.</li>\n        <li>The count (number) of reviews.</li>\n        <li>The overall rating.</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p style=\"font-size:16px\">The categorical variable in this dataset are :</p>\n    <ol  style=\"font-size:14px\">\n        <li>The Category</li>\n        <li>The Subcategory.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:16px\">Here the main questions that I'am going to treat in my notebook:</p>\n<ol style=\"font-size:16px\">\n    <li>The distribution of

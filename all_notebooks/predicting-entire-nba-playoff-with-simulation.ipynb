Using player level statistics is one way to go.\n\n2. **Use better win/loss model**: Our trained SVM Discriminator only has about 70%+ accuracy, it is sufficient but nowhere near perfect. Improvements can be achieved by adding more data features or using a more powerful model such as Neural Network or ensemble model.\n\n3. **Do better at distribution fitting**: In the projects, we used only a handful of distributions to speed up the fitting. To reduce the fitting errors, we can use more complex distributions. The lower the fitting error, the more realistic the samples we can generate.\n\n4. **Run more simulations**: Should we have more variables to account for in our win/loss Discriminator, we need to run more simulations to get the precise probabilities."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

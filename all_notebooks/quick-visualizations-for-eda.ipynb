Introduction\n\nI was always facinated by the visualizations which are posted on the kaggle kernel feed almost every hour. I found it quite difficult to decide where to begin due to the vast number of library options and functions. This forced me to keep looking for a standardized way for creating visualizations. I decided to go with Matplotlib and Seaborn which are not only is popular (meaning I could find lots of material to learn them) but also customizable enough for me to experiment with. I have been exploring these for quite some time now and this notebook is a structured summarization of what I learnt and retained. \n\n<b>Please note - I am in no way a visualization expert. Only a data scientist looking for <u>fast and intuitive methods</u> to add charts to my analysis for better understanding of the data (Not to forget the visual appeal they add for the reader). Following method explained should let you chart out almost every basic permutation of visualizations needed to explore data using the same set of steps throughout.</b>\n\nFollowing is the list for the visualizations which are explained.

The artist's canvas\n\nBefore we start plotting the charts, its important to have a 'canvas' to draw on. This is the FacetGrid method from Seaborn library. Quite simply, think about it as the chart area (and its properties) from a powerpoint chart. FacetGrid is a VERY powerful method to add dimentionality to your visualization, without having to run groupby codes before plotting.\n\nFacetGrid has 2 stages - \n\n<b>Step 1 - The canvas</b>\n1. Imagine the canvas like a grid of charts. The grid has rows and columns. Each cell can be a chart here.\n1. First you need to define the dataset you want to use. In this case df.\n3. Next you define the rows and columns for this spreadsheet of charts. <u>These are not the x and y of the chart. Rather x and y of the grid of charts.</u>\n3. You can also define a fourth variable which is depth or Hue (more about this later).\n4. Finally other properties such as size of the charts is defined as well.\n\n<b>Step 2 - The drawing</b>\n1. Imagine this as the actual 'drawing'.\n1. First you define what the drawing is. It can be any of the above chart types.\n2. Next you define what variables to use and all properties of the chart such as opacity etc.\n3.

E.g. a child’s age and her height.\n- Negative correlation means that as one feature increases, the other decreases.

Machine learning algorithms are very sensitive to the range and distribution of data points. Data outliers can deceive the training process resulting in longer training times and less accurate models. Outliers are defined as samples that are significantly different from the remaining data. Those are points that lie outside the overall pattern of the distribution. Statistical measures such as mean, variance and correlation are very susceptible to outliers.\n\n#### Nature of outliers:\n\nOutliers can occur in the dataset due to one of the following reasons,\n\n- Genuine extreme high and low values in the dataset\n- Introduced due to human or mechanical error\n- Introduced by replacing missing values\n\n#### Outlier Detection\n\n- Extreme Value Analysis\n- Z-score method\n- K Means clustering-based approach\n- Visualizing the data\n- Boxplot\n\n#### Outlier Treatment\n\n- Mean/Median or random Imputation\n- Trimming\n- Top, Bottom and Zero Coding\n- Discretization\n\n**However, in this article, I will be detecting outliers using boxplot method. If you want to learn in-depth on how to detect and handle outliers, please refer to this article. Box plot diagram also termed as Whisker’s plot is a graphical method typically depicted by quartiles and inter quartiles that helps in defining the upper limit and lower limit beyond which any data lying will be considered as outliers.\n\nIn brief, quantiles are points in a distribution that relates to the rank order of values in that distribution. For a given sample, you can find any quantile by sorting the sample. The middle value of the sorted sample is the middle quantile or the 50th percentile (also known as the median of the sample).\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"l = ['title_proximity_tfidf', 'description_proximity_tfidf',\n       'main_query_tfidf', 'query_jl_score', 'query_title_score',\n       'city_match', 'job_age_days']\nnumber_of_columns=7\nnumber_of_rows = len(l)-1/number_of_columns\nplt.figure(figsize=(number_of_columns,5*number_of_rows))\nfor i in range(0,len(l)):\n    plt.subplot(number_of_rows + 1,number_of_columns,i+1)\n    sns.set_style('whitegrid')\n    sns.boxplot(df[l[i]],color='green',orient='v')\n    plt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Observation:\n\nAs we can see there are lot of outliers in the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the distribution\n\n# Now to check the linearity of the variables it is a good practice to plot distribution graph and look for skewness \n# of features.

The good news is that this skill will naturally improve as you gain more experience.\n\n- Infuse domain knowledge\n- Create interactive features\n- Combine sparse classes\n- Add dummy variables\n- Remove unused features\n\nIn our case, since there is not much domain knowledge about the dataset, we are restricted in our application of feature engineering.

Modeling\n\n#### Some of the factors affecting the choice of a model are:\n\nWhether the model meets the business goals\n- How much pre-processing the model needs\n- How accurate the model is\n- How explainable the model is\n- How fast the model is: How long does it take to build a model, and how long does the model take to make predictions.\n- How scalable the model is\n\nAn important criterion affecting the choice of algorithm is model complexity. Generally speaking, a model is more complex is:\n\n- It relies on more features to learn and predict (e.g. using two features vs ten features to predict a target)\n- It relies on more complex feature engineering (e.g. using polynomial terms, interactions, or principal components)\n- It has more computational overhead (e.g. a single decision tree vs. a random forest of 100 trees).\n\nBesides this, the same machine learning algorithm can be made more complex based on the number of parameters or the choice of some hyperparameters. For example,\n\n- A regression model can have more features, or polynomial terms and interaction terms.\n- A decision tree can have more or less depth.\n- Making the same algorithm more complex increases the chance of overfitting."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Commonly used Machine Learning algorithms for classification\n\n#### Logistic Regression\n\nLogistic Regression models fit a “straight line”. In practice, they rarely perform well. We actually recommend skipping them for most machine learning problems.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they are easy to interpret and understand. However, our goal is not to study the data and write a research report. Our goal is to build a model that can make accurate predictions.\n\nIn this regard, logistic regression suffers from two major flaws:\n\n* It’s prone to overfit with many input features.\n* It cannot easily express non-linear relationships.\n\n#### Regularization\n\nAs mentioned above, logistic regression suffers from overfitting and difficulty in handling non-linear relationships. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by artificially penalizing model coefficients.\n\n* It can discourage large coefficients (by dampening them).\n* It can also remove features entirely (by setting their coefficients to 0).\n* The “strength” of the penalty is tunable. (More on this tomorrow…)\n\nTypes of regularization are Lasso (L1), ridge (L2) and elastic net (compromise between ridge and lasso)\n\n#### Decision Trees\n\nDecision trees model data as a “tree” of hierarchical branches. They make branches until they reach “leaves” that represent predictions. Due to their branching structure, decision trees can easily model nonlinear relationships.\n\nUnfortunately, decision trees suffer from a major flaw as well. If you allow them to grow limitlessly, they can completely “memorize” the training data, just from creating more and more and more branches. As a result, individual unconstrained decision trees are very prone to overfitting.​\n\nSo, how can we take advantage of the flexibility of decision trees while preventing them from overfitting the training data?\n\n#### Tree Ensembles\n\nEnsembles are machine learning methods for combining predictions from multiple separate models. There are a few different methods for ensembling, but the three most common are:\n\nBagging: attempts to reduce the chance of overfitting complex models.\n\n* It trains a large number of “strong” learners in parallel.\n* A strong learner is a model that’s relatively unconstrained.\n* Bagging then combines all the strong learners together in order to “smooth out” their predictions.\n* Commonly used technique is Random Forest\n\nBoosting: attempts to improve the predictive flexibility of simple models.\n\n* It trains a large number of “weak” learners in sequence.\n* A weak learner is a constrained model (i.e. you could limit the max depth of each decision tree).\n* Each one in the sequence focuses on learning from the mistakes of the one before it.\n* Boosting then combines all the weak learners into a single strong learner.\n* Commonly used technique is XGBoost and LightGBM\n\nLightGBM: Light GBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses a tree-based learning algorithm. Light GBM grows tree vertically while other algorithm grows trees horizontally meaning that Light GBM grows tree leaf-wise while other algorithm grows level-wise. It will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow. When growing the same leaf, Leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm.\n\nThere are many other algorithms as well like Support Vector machine, Neural Networks, etc. but we won't be taking it here.\n\nFor our case, I will be using XGBoost, Random Forest and LightGBM.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Splitting the dataset into training and testing"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Splitting the dataset by date\ntrain = df.loc[df['search_date_pacific']<'2018-01-27']\ntest = df.loc[df['search_date_pacific'] == '2018-01-27']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop the unnecessary columns\ntrain.drop(['search_date_pacific','class_id'],axis=1,inplace = True)\ntest.drop(['search_date_pacific','class_id'],axis=1,inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop irrelevant features\nX = df.drop(['search_date_pacific','class_id','apply'],axis=1)\ny = df['apply']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reset the index\nX = X.reset_index(drop='index')\ny = y.reset_index(drop='index')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train = train.drop(['apply'],axis=1)\ny_train = train['apply']\nX_test = test.drop(['apply'],axis=1)\ny_test = test['apply']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define a function to plot confusion matrix\n\ndef plot_confusion_matrix(cm, classes,\n                          normalize=False,\n                          title='Confusion matrix',\n                          cmap=plt.cm.Blues):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints and plots the confusion matrix.\n    Normalization can be applied by setting `normalize=True`\n    \"\"\"\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.imshow(cm, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)\n    plt.title(title)\n    plt.colorbar()\n    tick_marks = np.arange(len(classes))\n    plt.xticks(tick_marks, classes, rotation=0)\n    plt.yticks(tick_marks, classes)\n\n    thresh = cm.max() / 2.\n    for i, j in itertools.product(range(cm.shape[0]), range(cm.shape[1])):\n        plt.text(j, i, cm[i, j],\n                 horizontalalignment=\"center\",\n                 color=\"white\" if cm[i, j] > thresh else \"black\")\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.ylabel('True label')\n    plt.xlabel('Predicted label')\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define a function which will be used to get the important parameters like AUC, Classification report\n\ndef report(test_set, predictions,labels,title):\n    print('F1 score is:', f1_score(test_set,predictions))\n    print(\"AUC-ROC is: %3.2f\" % (roc_auc_score(test_set, predictions)))\n    plot_confusion_matrix(confusion_matrix(test_set, predictions),labels,title)\n    \n    #plot the curve\n    fpr, tpr, threshold = roc_curve(test_set,predictions)\n    auc = roc_auc_score(test_set,predictions)\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))\n    ax.set_title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')\n    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, 'b',label='Model - AUC = %0.3f'% auc)\n    ax.legend(loc='lower right')\n    plt.plot([0,1],[0,1],'r--', label='Chance')\n    ax.legend()\n    ax.set_xlim([-0.1,1.0])\n    ax.set_ylim([-0.1,1.01])\n    ax.set_ylabel('True Positive Rate')\n    ax.set_xlabel('False Positive Rate')\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Hyperparameter tuning and CV using Bayesian Optimizer"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Search for parameters of machine learning models that result in best cross-validation performance is necessary in almost all practical cases to get a model with best generalization estimate.

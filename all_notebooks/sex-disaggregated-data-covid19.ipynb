Though only 5 low-income countries report on deaths and cases in GH5050, their capacity to report on these indicators by sex remains low. On the other hand, lower-middle-income countries report more of their cases by sex as a share than any other income group. This is again driven by the absence of sex-disaggregation of cases by two countries with some of the largest caseloads in the world. If Brazilâ€™s nearly 780,000 cases were sex-disaggregated, the share of cases reported by sex for upper-middle-income countries would rise to 68 percent, and if the United Statesâ€™ 2 million cases were sex-disaggregated, the share of cases for high-income countries would more than double to 92 percent. Reporting on deaths by sex, meanwhile, reveals the most straightforward correlation between statistical capacity and income. High-income countries report practically all their deaths by sex and this share declines with each step down the income group ladder.\n\n\n![](https://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ODWBlog5.png)https://data2x.org/tracking-gender-data-on-covid-19-part-2/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import

The idea is to perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst and showcase my data analysis skills.\n\n\n\n# ABOUT THE COMPANY\n\nUrška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around\nthe world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nBellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their [website](https://bellabeat.com/).\n\nBellabeat Products:\n\n* Bellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress,\n  menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and\n  make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n  \n* Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects\n  to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n  \n* Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user\n  activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your\n  daily wellness.\n  \n* Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are\n  appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your\n  hydration levels\n\n\n\n# BUSINESS TASK\n\nSršen wants us to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits.Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n* To identify some trends in smart device usage\n* How these trends apply to bellabeat customers\n* How these trends could influence bellabeat marketing strategy\n\n\n# PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS\n\n* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n\n# SECONDARY STAKEHOLDER\n\n* Bellabeat marketing analytics team\n\n\n\n# DATA SOURCE\n\n* Public FitBit Tracker data set has been used for the case study which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit)\n* The data set was made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)\n* These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk from\n  04.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, \n  including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be \n  parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different \n  types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.\n* There are 18 csv files in the data set\n\nDATA LIMITATION\n\n* Only 33 participants took part in the survey, so could be biased and does not represent entire population of FitBit \n  users\n* The data was collected 5 years ago\n* The data was collected by third party\n\n\n\n# DATA PREPARATION\n\n\nIMPORTING PACKAGES","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np   # Arrays\nimport pandas as pd   # Data Structure,Cleansing & Analysis\nimport

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME\n\nIn Search of Lost Time (French: À la recherche du temps perdu), also translated as Remembrance of Things Past, is a novel in seven volumes by Marcel Proust (1871–1922). It is his most prominent work, known both for its length and its theme of involuntary memory; the most famous example of this is the \"episode of the madeleine,\" which occurs early in the first volume. It gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French, became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i1.wp.com/cgfewston.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/quote-how-about-proust-s-in-search-of-lost-time-tamaru-asked-if-you-ve-never-read-it-this-haruki-murakami-50-11-94.jpg?resize=814%2C335&ssl=1)cgfwston.me"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from tensorflow.keras import utils\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom tensorflow.keras import models\nfrom tensorflow.keras import optimizers\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, Callback\n\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize.treebank import TreebankWordDetokenizer\nnltk.download('punkt')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes by Erin Ward  https://www.kaggle.com/eward96/derry-girls-new-script-generator"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def process(text):\n    with open (text, \"r\", encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\") as file:\n        data=file.readlines()\n        script = \"\"\n        for i in data:\n            i = i.lower().replace('\"', '').replace(\"\\n\", \" \\n \")\n            if i.strip() != \"\":\n                script += \"\".join(i).replace(\"\\n\",\" \\n \")\n        return script","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = process(\"../input/marcel-proust-in-search-of-lost-time/proust_dataset_ENG.csv\") \nprint(df[0:2000])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Text_Data = df\n\ncharindex = list(set(Text_Data))\ncharindex.sort() \nprint(charindex)\n\nnp.save(\"charindex.npy\", charindex)\n\nprint(len(Text_Data))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The snippet below take so long that I could read the Whole Proust till I wait for it.\n\nFake, that's just a figure of speech."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"chars_size = len(charindex)\nseq_len = 80\n\nx_train = []\ny_train = []\n\nfor i in range(0, len(Text_Data)-seq_len, 1 ): \n    X = Text_Data[i:i + seq_len]\n    Y = Text_Data[i + seq_len]\n    x_train.append([charindex.index(x) for x in X])\n    y_train.append(charindex.index(Y))\n\nx_train = np.reshape(x_train, (len(x_train), seq_len))\n\ny_train = utils.to_categorical(y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks) are excellent for learning and generating text, because they are capable of learning long-term dependencies.

Education - In number of years of the customer \n5. Marital status - Of the customer\n6. Usage - Avg# times the customer wants to use the treadmill every week\n7. Fitness - Self rated fitness score of the customer(5-Very Fit, 1 - very unfit)\n8. Income - Of the customer\n9.

Why are trade-mills not attracting more single people. Is it because Single people get more opprotunity and time to do outdoor work-outs?\n* Age Range distribution - This shows me that the customer profile is fairly young. Close to 90% are between 20 and 40 years of Age.\n* Income Range distribution - This shows that this a customer profile who are doing well economically, there are few outliers whose earning are significantly higher(Males are more compared to Females in the higher Income bracket)\n* Education distribution - A well educated customer profile, 47% are graduate, 16% of them are post graduate or more.

Let talk about these in detail as to why the model is considering these features would impact the winning chances of a team.\n\n1. Dragons killed - Dragons are elite monsters found in the jungle. Depending on which dragon the team kills, they granted some power ups like increase attack or movement speed, etc. Our lasso regression model has selected this feature to impact the winning changes, which ideally makes sense. If the team secure early dragon kills in the game, they get different power ups which in turn help them kill more opposite team's champions and earn more gold.\n\n2.

So drivers are not willing to take the trip as they will not have a booking to return back to the city, hence they cancel the trip. \n\n2) Customers find massive number of unavailable cars during evening hours from 5PM to 10PM, this could be due to huge number of flight arrivals and departures in the evening, that results in high demand for the cabs.

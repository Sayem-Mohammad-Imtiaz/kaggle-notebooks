Running advertising campaigns/sponsoring events in colleges/universities emphasizing the benefits of staying fit to target ‘singles’ as the customer base. Target age range between 20-25years\n\n- Understand through market research and surveys ‘singles’ fitness requirements, goals, etc. Incorporate the same in model as “Add-ons” to make product more attractive and easier to sell to ‘singles’. \n\n- Setting up health check-up camps in societies to raise awareness and tying it up with product promotion. This way both-the existing ‘partnered’ base and ‘single’ customer base may be further expanded \n\n- People who have 12-14 years of education. They can also be target customers for TM195 & TM498.\n\n- Posters in doctor’s waiting area promoting health and fitness-age range 40-50years. This age group is not targeted well and may have high potential as they are mostly inclined towards maintaining a good health.\n\n- Tie up with corporates and discounted deals for the employees on the purchase of treadmill\n- Special deals on TM798 for female customers or working women \n- Boosting Sales & marketing campaigns more during January – as people tend to make years resolution about getting fit\n- Emphasizing the importance of exercising anytime/anywhere and more people can exercise the same time as opposed to going to gym\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##################################################End of Data Analysis#########################################################","metadata":{}}]}

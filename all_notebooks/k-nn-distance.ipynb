It also often refers to rescaling by the minimum and range of the vector, to make all the elements lie between 0 and 1 thus bringing all the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale.\n\nNormalization is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does not make assumptions about the distribution of your data, such as k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks.\n\nTo normalize the data we will use the MinMaxScaler from sklearn library.

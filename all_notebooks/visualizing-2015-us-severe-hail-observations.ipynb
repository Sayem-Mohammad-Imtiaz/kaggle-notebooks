While this initial workstream includes observations from one single year, a thorough analysis would require an inclusion of this data set alongside hail observations from other years. A trend analysis of this data significant in that it may be able to discern changing patterns given continued global warming and gradual shifts in climate. I am currently working to ingest this data into Tableau, in attempt to answer the following questions:\n\n1) Where is severe hail most frequent? With other data sets, do we see a shift in where severe hail is most frequent?\n\n2) When (in terms of time of year and time of day) is severe hail most frequent? Are some locations prone to experiencing severe hail during certain time frames, while other locations may experience severe hail at a different time? With other data sets, do we see a shift in when severe hail is most frequent?\n\nTo answer these questions, it is my intention to create a Tableau dashboard that can be filtered based on state, month, and hour of day. Below I have provided my initial Python script for organizing the data."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"16bd8516-a328-f0da-2bb5-91bc8e7dd53a"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

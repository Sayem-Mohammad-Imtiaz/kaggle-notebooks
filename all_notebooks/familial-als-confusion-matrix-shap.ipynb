The application of molecular genetic techniques to ALS, marked by the report in 1993 of linkage of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene in familial ALS, signaled an increasing focus on genetics in ALS as a means to gain insights into the pathogenesis of the disease, identify therapeutic targets and facilitate diagnosis.\"\n\n\"In recent years a rapidly expanding list of genetic variations linked to ALS and their related clinical and pathological correlates continues to provide key insights into the causes of ALS and inform therapy development.\"\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4670044/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fng1001-103/MediaObjects/41588_2001_Article_BFng1001103_Fig2_HTML.gif)nature.com"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/clinical/Family_History_Log.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Columns Names:</span>**\n\nfamgen = Gender\n\nfamguid = GUID of selected relative\n\nfamher = Heredity\n\nfamhx1 = A detailed family history was obtained\n\nfamrel = Relative\n\nfamrelsp = Other relative\n\nfhalz = Alzheimer\n\nfhasth = Asthma\n\nfhdem = Dementia\n\nfhgen = Was genetic testing for ALS/Dementia/FTD performed\n\nfhgnc9 = Family member has C9ORF72 mutation\n\nfhgnfus = Family member has FUS mutation\n\nfhgnot = Family Member Has Other Gene Mutation\n\nfhgnsod1 = Family member has SOD1 mutation\n\nfhgntdp = Family member has TDP-43 mutation\n\nfhpsy = Specify psychiatric disorder\n\nfhstk = Stroke"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Genetic susceptibility to ALS</span>**\n\n\"ALS clinical registry data and more recent meta-analysis based on prospective population based registries suggest that up to 10% of ALS patients have a family history of ALS in a first- or second-degree relative, generally classified as familial ALS (FALS). The remaining 90% of patients with no evident family history of ALS are designated as sporadic ALS (SALS), a potentially misleading designation for several reasons. First, persons with ALS associated with a causative gene variant may lack a family history of ALS as a result of reduced penetrance or small family size. In addition, family history may be incomplete or inaccurate owing to incomplete family history, incorrect diagnoses in ancestors, or death from other causes prior to onset of ALS in relatives genetically at risk.\"\n\n\"Estimates of the heritability of ALS, a measure of the extent of phenotypic variability that is attributable to genetic variation, provide additional evidence that genetic factors play a significant role in sporadic as well as familial ALS. In a study of identical twins that included twins with or without a history of ALS in other relatives heritability was estimated to be about 76% (95% CI=60–86%) for twins with a family history of ALS, and approximately 61% (95% CI=38–78%) for twins with no other family history of ALS .\"\n\n\"Recently it has been suggested that genetic contributions to ALS may represent the inheritance of risk variants of multiple genes, acting interdependently to cause ALS. The hypothesis that ALS may be oligogenic implies that at least two pathogenic ALS gene variants are required to initiate disease.\"\n\n\"Several studies have shown that a subset of FALS and SALS (sporadic ALS) patients carry at least one known ALS-linked gene variant in conjunction with a second potentially pathogenic variant and offer support for the oligogenic concept of ALS genetics, but these data have been questioned on the basis that the second gene variant may represent a benign variant, potential cohort selection bias and small sample size, and further validation was recommended.\" \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4670044/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer,ColumnTransformer\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold,cross_val_score,RepeatedStratifiedKFold,train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler,StandardScaler,LabelEncoder,LabelBinarizer\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression,LogisticRegressionCV\nfrom numpy import absolute,mean,std\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE,ADASYN\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,accuracy_score,auc\nfrom imblearn.ensemble import BalancedRandomForestClassifier,EasyEnsembleClassifier,BalancedBaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,f1_score,roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold,GridSearchCV,RandomizedSearchCV,StratifiedKFold,cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier,ExtraTreesClassifier,BaggingClassifier,AdaBoostClassifier,GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB,BernoulliNB\nfrom sklearn.gaussian_process import GaussianProcessClassifier\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n\n# for model explanation\nimport shap \nimport eli5\nfrom eli5.sklearn import PermutationImportance","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Shashwat Tiwari https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatwork/insurance-company-complaint-prediction/notebook\n\ndef multiclass_roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred, average=\"macro\"):\n    lb = LabelBinarizer()\n    lb.fit(y_test)\n    y_test = lb.transform(y_test)\n    y_pred = lb.transform(y_pred)\n    return roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred, average=average)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">Familial inheritance patterns in ALS</span>**\n\n\"Inheritance of most forms of familial ALS is autosomal dominant although autosomal recessive and X-linked dominant familial ALS also occur.

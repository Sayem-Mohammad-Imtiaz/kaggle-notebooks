The amount of deforested area for 2019, mainly due to the increase in deforestation in Para, Amazonas, Acre and Roraima, was last seen back in 2008. 2019 was also marked for having broken records of burnings in the months of March and April, even comparing to years around 2002 ~ 2005, which had unnaceptable amounts fire outbreaks (**Chapters 1.4.1**, **1.4.3** and **2.3**). \n\n\n- **What is the behavior of fires: where and when do they occur?**\n\nThe states with the most fire outbreaks are Para, Mato Grosso and Rondonia, in this order. The analysis showed that the peak month of fires may vary for each state, depending on their geographic location (**Chapter 1.4.2**).\n\n\n- **How correlated is the number of fire outbreaks and the deforested area?**\n\nFire outbreaks and deforested area have a high positive correlation coefficient of 0.83 (**Chapter 3.1**). This also means that fires are not the only important factor to the forest degradation. Indeed, fires are not the only method to degradate a forest and prepare to any type of economic activity.\n\n\n- **What is the effect of climate phenomenas El Niño and La Niña on Amazon degradation?**\n\nThere is a trend of increasing the amount of fire outbreaks in years with the occurrence of El Niño Phenomenon and decrease in years with the occurrence of La Niña, with some exceptions. However, the total deforested area does not seem to be impacted by these climatic phenomena (**Chapter 3.2**). \n\n\n- **Are there evidences of natural/unnatural causes in forest degradation?** \n\nOne cannot be sure how much of this deforestation is unnatural. But this analysis found that there are indeed some evidences of deforestation caused by human activity:\n\n1) The amount of fire outbreaks has a strong relation with climatic phenomena (EL Niño and La Niña), but the deforested area does not have any (**Chapter 3.2**).\n\n2) Para, Amazonas, Acre and Roraima had much larger deforestation areas than previous years, indicating that they may not have occurred naturally (**Chapter 2.3**).\n\n3) In 15 years, 3% of the entire Brazilian Amazon area was degradated (**Chapter 2.3**). If this was a natural behavior, in 500 years the Amazon, which is millions of years old, wouldn't be a rainforest anymore."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\">\n<font size = 3><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n<br>\n<br>\nAs you know, __Linear regression__ finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1, x_2 $, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n<br><br>\n$$\ny = 𝜃_0 + 𝜃_1 * x_1 + 𝜃_2 * x_2 +...\n$$\n<br>\nand finds the values of parameters $θ_0, θ_1, θ_2$, etc, where the term $θ_0$ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n<br><br>\n$$\nℎ_θ(𝑥) = 𝜃^TX\n$$\n<p></p>\n\n</div>\n\nLogistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, y, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n\nLogistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function 𝜎:\n\n$$\nℎ_θ(𝑥) = 𝜎({θ^TX}) =  \\frac {e^{(θ_0 + θ_1 * x_1 + θ_2 * x_2 +...)}}{1 + e^{(θ_0 + θ_1 * x_1 + θ_2 * x_2 +...)}}\n$$\nOr:\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = 𝜎({θ^TX}) = \\frac{e^{θ^TX}}{1+e^{θ^TX}} \n$$\n\nIn this equation, ${θ^TX}$ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $𝜎(θ^TX)$ is the sigmoid or [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n\nSo, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid but then treats the result as a probability:\n\n<img\nsrc=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/kgv9alcghmjcv97op4d6onkyxevk23b1.png\" width = \"400\" align = \"center\">\n\n\nThe objective of __Logistic Regression__ algorithm, is to find the best parameters θ, for $ℎ_θ(𝑥) = 𝜎({θ^TX})$, in such a way that the model best predicts the class of each case."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import *  \n\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport itertools\n%matplotlib inline \n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/heart.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6ef63078198dc57371cd28e873a9bf4ebb4f43dc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"07f962594068bf84ceb1f67e8f6422f2ab171aaf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = df.drop(['target', ], axis=1)\nX.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ff41e967695afc638bd3598aa9ecdc8984b78392"},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = df['target']\ny.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"25470dc6df59bffb30c126b9dbc9c679eb262034"},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)\nprint ('Train set:', X_train.shape,  y_train.shape)\nprint ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad29aefad300aa2baf4f9eeab2add67b3a199a44"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Utility Functions**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a862b83acf5524814b9d01285fe12ba0dca33547"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_confusion_matrix(y, pred, labels, classes, normalize=False, cmap=plt.cm.Blues):\n    \"\"\"\n    Plots the confusion matrix.\n    Args:\n        y: Data Labels\n        pred: Predicted outputs\n        labels: A list of label values to calculate confusion matrix\n        classes: A list of containing unique class names for plotting\n        normalize:Wheter to plot data with int or percentage values.

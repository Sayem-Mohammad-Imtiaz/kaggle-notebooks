How is this different from a supermarket?\n\nWhen an individual in the United States goes to purchase food, they usually do so at one of a few select types of places. This might be a supermarket, big box store, bodega, neighborhood grocer, or farmer's market. Sometimes people don't cook themselves and instead visit restaurants, from large fast food chains to local cafes. Generally, none of these places are where the food starts off; instead they are at the end of chains of growers, storage facilities, and merchants. \n\nThe data in this dataset specifically covers \"terminal markets\", a type of large, wholesale market where commodities are bought and sold. Those in the dataset are specifically agricultural wholesale markets that sell large amounts of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and other edibles.\n\n### Research Questions\n\nWhen examining this data, I had a few questions that I wanted to answer, some immediately visable, others requiring more detailed research and exploration.\n\n* Where do most of the pumpkins in the US come from?\n* Where are they shipped to?\n* What is the impact of shipping to these markets on the environment? How much does this transportation cost?\n* Are there any conclusions drawn from these questions that can be applied more generally towards agricultural or commodity distribution in the United States as a whole?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing Packages","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing the dataset using Pandas","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"directory = '../input/a-year-of-pumpkin-prices'\ncity_names = ['atlanta','baltimore','boston','chicago','columbia','dallas','detroit',\n             'los-angeles','miami','new-york','philadelphia','san-fransisco','st-louis']\nfile_extension = '_9-24-2016_9-30-2017.csv'\n\ncity_dfs = {}\ncity_sizes = {}\n\nfor city in city_names:\n    file_name = directory + '/' + city + file_extension\n    new_df = pd.read_csv(file_name)\n    city_sizes[city] = new_df.shape[0]\n    city_dfs[city] = new_df\n    \nfull_df = pd.concat(city_dfs)\n#Dataframe containing information from all cities, useful for looking at the data as a whole","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"origin_locations = full_df['Origin'].value_counts().to_dict()\n\ndef get_colors(data):\n    return [plt.cm.terrain(i/float(len(data.keys()))) for i in range(len(data.keys()))]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (14, 8))\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,2,1)\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(1,2,2)\n\nax1.bar(origin_locations.keys(), origin_locations.values(), color = colors1)\n\ndef make_a_pretty_graph(data, ax, title, xlabel, ylabel):\n    colors = get_colors(data)\n    ax.bar(data.keys(), data.values(), color=colors)\n    for i, (k, v) in enumerate(data.items()):\n        ax.text(k, # where to put the text on the x coordinates\n        v + 4, # where to put the text on the y coordinates\n        v, # value to text\n        fontsize = 10, # fontsize\n        horizontalalignment = 'center', # center the text to be more pleasant\n        verticalalignment = 'center'\n        )\n    ax.tick_params(axis = 'x', labelrotation = 90, labelsize = 12)\n    ax.tick_params(axis = 'y', labelsize = 12)\n    ax.set_title(title, fontsize=14)\n    ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=12, labelpad=4)\n    ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=12, labelpad=2)\n\nmake_a_pretty_graph(origin_locations, ax1, \"Pumpkin States of Origin by Frequency\",\"Location of Origin\",\"# of Orders\")\nmake_a_pretty_graph(city_sizes, ax2, \"Pumpkin Destinations by Frequency\",\"Destination\",\"# of Orders\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From examining these graphs, it appears that pumpkins grow well in a wide range of climates.

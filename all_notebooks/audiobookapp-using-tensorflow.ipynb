Each customer in the database has made a purchase at least once, that's why he/she is in the database. We want to create a machine learning algorithm based on our available data that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company.\n\nThe main idea is that if a customer has a low probability of coming back, there is no reason to spend any money on advertising to him/her. If we can focus our efforts SOLELY on customers that are likely to convert again, we can make great savings. Moreover, this model can identify the most important metrics for a customer to come back again. Identifying new customers creates value and growth opportunities.\n\nYou have a .csv summarizing the data. There are several variables: Customer ID, ), Book length overall (sum of the minute length of all purchases), Book length avg (average length in minutes of all purchases), Price paid_overall (sum of all purchases) ,Price Paid avg (average of all purchases), Review (a Boolean variable whether the customer left a review), Review out of 10 (if the customer left a review, his/her review out of 10, Total minutes listened, Completion (from 0 to 1), Support requests (number of support requests; everything from forgotten password to assistance for using the App), and Last visited minus purchase date (in days).\n\nThese are the inputs (excluding customer ID, as it is completely arbitrary. It's more like a name, than a number).\n\nThe targets are a Boolean variable (0 or 1). We are taking a period of 2 years in our inputs, and the next 6 months as targets. So, in fact, we are predicting if: based on the last 2 years of activity and engagement, a customer will convert in the next 6 months. 6 months sounds like a reasonable time. If they don't convert after 6 months, chances are they've gone to a competitor or didn't like the Audiobook way of digesting information.\n\nThe task is simple: create a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.\n\nThis is a classification problem with two classes: won't buy and will buy, represented by 0s and 1s.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import relevant libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Extract the data from CSV","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_csv_data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/audiobook-app-data/audiobook_data_2.csv')\nraw_csv_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Renaming the \"Unnamed: 0\" to \"ID\"","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_csv_data.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'ID'}, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_csv_data = raw_csv_data.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"type(raw_csv_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_csv_data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The inputs are all columns in the csv, except for the first one [:,0]\n# (which is just the arbitrary customer IDs that bear no useful information),\n# and the last one [:,-1] (which is our targets)\nunscaled_inputs_all = raw_csv_data[:, 1:-1]\n\n# The targets are in the last column.

above confusion matrix and classification report shows the an analysis of the SVM results for both red and white wine combined by the quality rating (3-9). This shows that predications are most accurate for the middle scores (5-7) and get less accurate as the ratings go lower or higher. \n\nThis is a bit of a black box, however. I'm interested to know the top contributing factors to the SVM model, which is displayed in the academic article referenced earlier in the notebook that the dataset comes from. HOWEVER, I am having a really heard time finding methods to do this which build off of the model I created above. I even read through the ski-kit learn documenation for SVM , but could not find a method that would work with my dataframe type, number of variables, previously used code, etc. \n\nSome attempts in the next few code boxes. I will admit, I could not fully understand where all of these variables and methods were pulling from, but I wanted to show my attempts!\n\nIn the end, I think I would adopt a different method to determine top contributing facots, and to do multi-variate regression analysis. However, this was very interesting, and I hand't heard of SVM models before, so it was cool to try out! And, it did give me some new information. Mainly, that the middle quality ratings (5-7) are better predicted via the variables than the lower or higher end quality ratings. However, this also may be because there are more samples of the middle quality ratings than there are of the higher and lower.

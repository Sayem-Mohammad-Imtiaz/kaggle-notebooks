It affects our daily activities, as well as impact the lives of family members and friends.\"\n* SAMH states that 1 in 7 Singaporeans have experienced a mood or anixety disorder (which are common mental illnesses).\n* SAMH also states that \"Despite their prevalence, persons with mental illness still face considerable stigma and discrimination. Many such individuals are thus reluctant to seek help and treatment.\"\n* It is supposed to be beneficial for people suffering from mental illness to firstly recognise it, and secondly, to seek help for it.\n* Tech companies are anecdotally notorious for endless and high-stress work environment.\n* As a tech student, I'm personally interested to find out the prevalent attitudes regarding MH in the tech workplace.\n* I am also interested to identify what company features are most critical in inclining employees towards recognising their Mental Health Disorders (MHD) and seeking help for it.\n\n## Objectives\n1. Explore the data provided in survey for insights into Mental Health.\n2. Attempt to build Classifiers to predict whether an employee:\n    1. will be willing to raise MH issues with future employers\n    2. will seek professional diagnosis for MHD\n    3. will seek treatment for MHD\n\nSAMH: https://www.samhealth.org.sg/understanding-mental-health/what-is-mental-illness/\n\n### Datasets required:\n* `mental-heath-in-tech-2016_20161114.csv` from [Kaggle (OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2016)](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-2016)\n\n### Outline\n1.

I can not find a reasonable explanation for this but I believe it could be due to data input error.\n\nBMI does have a few shortcomings. It understimates fat composition for different ethinicites such as South Asians.

A person can have a normal BMI but still have large amount of fat stored in the abdomen. Abdominal obesity is well-researched risk factor for CVD and is being suggested to be used in adjunct with BMI to determine a person's CVD risk.\n\nAccording to Bozeman et al.

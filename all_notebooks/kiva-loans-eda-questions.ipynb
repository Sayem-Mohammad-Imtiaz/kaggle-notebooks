Kiva lenders have provided over $1 billion dollars in loans to over 2 million people. In order to set investment priorities, help inform lenders, and understand their target communities, answering some fundamental questions is necessary. However, this requires inference based on a limited set of information for each borrower.\n\nIn this project our country in focus will be the Philippines,(though Kenya will be featured in some questions). And the vital questions to be answered are as follows: \n\n1. What country got the most loans? Does the number of times a country is referenced relate to the quantity of loans it got?\n2. What sector got the most loans? Does the number of times a sector is referenced relate to the quantity of loans it got?\n3. For the top sector, what activity had the highest amount of loans? What does that say about that activity?\n4. Which region had the highest loan amounts?\n5. What is the general repayment habit?\n6. What were the numbers between male and female recipients? Does that communicate anything?\n7. What sector in Kenya got the highest loans?\n8.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.\nPeople with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.\n\nThe dataset is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. \nThe dataset contains results from a study that was on cardiovascular diseases and monitored 12 different metrics in patients as well as indicating if they secumed to heart disease and the time to the outcome.\n\nWe will look at which of these metrics points to heart failure and if there is any correlation to time.\n\nThis analysis is done as part of  the course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](zerotopandas.com).

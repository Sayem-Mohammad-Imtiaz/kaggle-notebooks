We can suppose that literacy is required in very frequented cities, but there are jobs for many kinds of people, so graduation is not as much necessary. Cities with highest rates of graduated people have few trains, and are probably cities where elites are living.\n* Cities with highest gender inequality toward literacy have few trains, whereas cities with most trains have a quite good score.

In other words, the ratio of males to females shot was roughly 22:1. This is clearly disproportionate, according to Statista (statista.com/statistics/737923/us-population-by-gender/), the US population was 51% female and 49% male over the last decade, but nearly all of the people shot by cops were male. This may because males are more likely to commit crimes - according to Wikipedia \"Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_differences_in_crime). However, this alone is likely not enough to account for this discrepency, I hypothesize that men are seen as more threatening than women (due to gender roles and other factors such as physical stature) and thus cops are more likely to feel the need to shoot a male suspect than a female one. It may be that men are conditioned by society to be more aggressive than women and therefore are more likely to be violent/aggressive or percieved as such both if committing crimes or confronting officers.

From this we can infer that white and Asian people are shot disproportionately less frequently, while black and Latinx people are disproportionately more likely to be shot by police. This could be due to racist stereotypes that paint black and Latinx people are more dangerous & violent (e.g. our dear president: \"Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed...\" (2013 Twitter); \"When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best...they’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" (2015)), which makes cops see them as dangerous. White people obviously benefit from white privilege, and the perception of Asian people as a \"model minority\" may cause cops to see them as less dangerous and thus make cops less likely to shoot Asian people.

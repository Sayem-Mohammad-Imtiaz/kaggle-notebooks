In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature in determining the target value.\n\nThis assumption we just read about is very **Naive** when we are dealing with real world data because most of the times, features do depend on each other in determining the target - this is why the algorithm gets its name **Naive Bayes** (duhh!).\n\n> Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.\n\nBayes theorem provides a way of calculating posterior probability P(c|x) - *(read as Probability of **c** given **x**)*,  from P(c), P(x) and P(x|c). Look at the equation below:\n>\n> $$\\mathbf{P} \\left({x \\mid c} \\right) = \\frac{\\mathbf{P} \\left ({c \\mid x} \\right) \\mathbf{P} \\left({c} \\right)}{\\mathbf{P} \\left( {x} \\right)}$$\n\nIn the *above* equation,\n\n* P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class (c, target) given predictor (x, attributes).\n* P(c) is the prior probability of class **c**.\n* P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor(the query  **x**) given class.\n* P(x) is the prior probability of predictor **x**.\n\n**Note : ** Independence assumption is never correct but often works well in practice.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c0ac90e7494324245b5c8088281a784e03690ac9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Why should we use Naive Bayes ?**\n\n* As stated above, It is **_easy_** to build and is particularly useful for **_very large data sets_**.\n* It is **extremely fast** for both training and prediction.\n* It provide straightforward probabilistic prediction.\n* It is often very easily interpretable.\n* It has very few (if any) tunable parameters.\n* It perform well in case of categorical input variables compared to numerical variable(s).

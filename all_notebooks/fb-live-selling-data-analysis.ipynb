There was nine instanced where the values are not matching. The values were replaced with correct calculations. \n\n\n# New Features and Rationale\n\nAs part of the analysis, we created six new features. They are :\n\nall_reaction_count, reactio_match, react_comment_r, react_share_r, postive_reactions, negative_reactions.\n\nall_reaction_count: This feature was generated to check the validity of data 'num_reactions'.  The logic used to create the column is num_reaction = sum(num_likes, num_loves,num_wows,num_hahas,num_sads,num_angrys) .\n\nreactio_match: This is a bool column. If the values are False that means num_reactions and all_reactions_count values are different. \n\nreact_comment_r: reactions to comments ratio. The logic for creating this variable is num_reactions/num_comments \n\nreact_share_r: Reactiont to share ratio. The logic to create the variable is num_reactions/num_shares.\n\npostive_reactions: This is the overall positve reaction count. Logic to generate the column : positive_reactions = sum(num_likes,num_loves,num_wows)\n\nnegative_reactions: This variable represents overall negative reactions. Logic to generate the columsn :  negative_reactions = sum(num_hahas, num_sads, num_angrys)\n\n\n# Clean Data\n\nFrom the final data, we will exclude the columns all_reaction_count, reactio_match.

From the status_published, we can create a segment of a day such as early morning, morning, noon, evening, and night. Another new variable idea will be the days, such as working day or weekend. Generally, Facebook live sellers may be trying to earn a side income and selecting free time from work. The sellers may have a hunch on the best time they are getting audience and revenue. By creating this variable, we may be able to frame a use case. One can create a couple of new Machine Learning use cases from this new data. \n\n\nThe curators of the dataset, Nassim Dehouche, and Apiradee Wongkitrungrueng, used this data in a paper they presented in a Marketing Conference.

As we began to leverage various EDA techniques, we quickly arrived a key analytical question that were aiming to solve: are defensive or offensive statistics a better predictor of a player's RPM?\n\nWe leveraged heatmaps, scatter plots, and regression modeling diagnostics to arrive at a conclusion that yields one point of view, but does warrant additional analysis.\n\n***In essense:***\n\nOffensive statistics are generally a better predictor of a player's RPM, than a player's deffensive statistics.

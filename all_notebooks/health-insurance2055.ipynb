Now if you are wondering how \n#can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is \n#where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers \n#who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get \n#hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n\n#Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a \n#premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by \n#the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called ‘sum assured’) to the \n#customer.\n\n#Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely \n#helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out \n#to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.\n\n#Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have \n#information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), \n#Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport scipy.stats as stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction/train.csv\")\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"../input/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction/test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#map categorical data to numerical data\ndef numberise(series):\n    if( series.infer_objects().dtype != np.dtype('O')):\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(\"Updating: {}\".format(series.name))\n        labels = series.unique()\n        dicmap = {}\n        for level in labels:\n            dicmap.update({level: np.where(labels==level)[0][0]})\n        print(\"\\t\", dicmap)\n        series.replace(dicmap, inplace=True)\n\nfor col in train.columns:\n    numberise(train[col])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Since Response is a binary categorical predictor, a logistic model is appropriate.

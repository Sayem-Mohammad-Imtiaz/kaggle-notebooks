Respondents were told to, “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” This measure is also referred to as Cantril life ladder, or just life ladder in our analysis.\n In particular, the ladder score shows moderately strong positive relationship with the following parameters:\n* Logged GDP per capital: The statistics of GDP per capita (variable name gdp) in purchasing power parity (PPP) at constant 2017 international dollar prices are from the October 14,2020 update of the World Development Indicators (WDI). \n* Social support : Social support (or having someone to count on in times of trouble) is the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”\n* Health life expectancy: Healthy life expectancies at birth are based on the data extracted from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository (Last updated: 2020-09-28). The data at the source are available for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016. To match this report’s sample period (2005-2020), interpolation and extrapolation are used.\n\n(b) There is a fairly strong positive relationship between the ladder score and freedom to make life choices. Freedom to make life choices is the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n\n(c) No relationship between happiness and generosity. Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.Contrary to the conventional belief that giving begets joy, there seem to be low or no correlation between ladder score and generosity. This means that self-reported happiness rating may not be related to the act of giving. \n\n(d) Negative relationship between happiness and corruption perception. Corruption perception is The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, we use the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level. Based on the heatmap, it appears that higher the perception of corruption, the lower the happiness rating. However, the negative relationship is not strong, which may mean that the corruption perception may not be a strong determinant of happiness.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(30,10))\ncorr = sns.heatmap(data.corr(), annot = True, cmap = 'Spectral')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-12T21:11:16.284272Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-12T21:11:16.284632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-12T21:11:17.027119Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-12T21:11:16.284607Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-12T21:11:17.02644Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

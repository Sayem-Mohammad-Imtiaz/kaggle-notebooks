For newbies/those who haven’t noticed, all submissions that improve on the public LB are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/8540/publicleaderboarddata.zip) linked from the [leaderboard page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/leaderboard) - every row in that CSV creates a new public LB ordering. (The file is available here via @inversion's [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion/talkingdata-leaderboard-data) too.) If you select by a time cutoff, then groupby teams and take the max submission score for each, and rank that, you end up with a snapshot of the public LB. I’ve put a kernel here to make it easy…\n\nYou can fork this Notebook and change the last cell, or download it and run it locally.\n\nI’ve demo'ed only my own here – and I think it would be nicer if people stick to sharing their own journey, rather than using it to point out other people who mysteriously join & leap into the medals in the dying moments >:S"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport numpy as np, pandas as pd","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"01d7ccb311c14218244693339a7349643fc644a1","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"s = pd.read_csv('../input/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection-publicleaderboard.csv', parse_dates=['SubmissionDate'])\ncut = pd.to_datetime('2018-05-08')\ns = s.loc[s.SubmissionDate<=cut] # omit post competition subs\ns['doy'] = s.SubmissionDate.dt.dayofyear\ndoy2date = s.groupby('doy').SubmissionDate.max().dt.date.to_dict()\ndays = np.unique(s.doy.values)","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"659e20a74feb210a5db5858864c689f21928c1e3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def leaderboard(doy):\n    return s.loc[s.doy<=doy].groupby('TeamName').Score.max().rank(ascending=False)\n\ndef leaderboard_rank(doy, team):\n    return leaderboard(doy).get(team)\n\ndef chart_public_lb(team):\n    ser = pd.Series({doy2date[doy]:leaderboard_rank(doy, team) for doy in days})\n    p = ser.plot(figsize=(12,5))\n    p.set_title(team + ' - TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge - Public LB Rank')\n    p.invert_yaxis()\n    p.grid(True)\n    p.set_ylim(top=0)\n    return p","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"68ba2746347495b5810940aadc2dacb08e3bedb1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"chart_public_lb('James Trotman') # change this to your team name","execution_count":7,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

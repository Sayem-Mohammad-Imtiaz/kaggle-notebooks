Other than participating musicians, few people get to witness the rehearsal technique of conductors and understand how their musical goals are communicated. Even fewer see the process involved in preparing musical scores for performance. Fortunately, many conductors leave behind a written legacy in the form of markings entered on the scores they use for study or performance. While the entire realm of mental preparation cannot possibly be revealed through these annotations, such markings can offer substantial information about many aspects of a conductor's preparation process.\" \n\n\"Therefore, a study of conductor score markings has the potential to increase our understanding of the art of conducting in general and the specific techniques of individual conductors. One conductor whose collection of scores is remarkably intact and well-preserved is Eugene Ormandy (1899-1985). Ormandy was the renowned music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra for forty-two years (1938-80), not counting the two years (1936-38) he spent as co-director with his predecessor Leopold Stokowski (1882-1977), and his work as conductor laureate until his final performance with the orchestra at Carnegie Hall in 1984.\"  \n\nhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Marking-the-Way%3A-The-Significance-of-Eugene-Score-Bewley/c3d278b3719bcbe9921eb5ee6f3894ac4bcf2eaa","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<iframe width=\"727\" height=\"409\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wplz4L5iezw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Eugene Ormandy & The Philadelphia Orchestra – The Columbia Legacy | Unboxing\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wplz4L5iezw\n\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra boasts a number of significant media firsts.

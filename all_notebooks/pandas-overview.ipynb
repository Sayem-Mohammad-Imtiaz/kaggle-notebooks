Slicing Data Frames - Selecting rows and columns\n\n### Selection Using Label/Index (using loc)\n\n#### Column Selection \n\nTo select a column of a `DataFrame` by column label, the safest and fastest way is to use the `.loc` [method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.loc.html). General usage of `.loc` looks like `df.loc[rowname, colname]`. (Reminder that the colon `:` means \"everything.\")  For example, if we want the `color` column of the `ex` data frame, we would use: `ex.loc[:, 'color']`\n\n- You can also slice across columns. For example, `baby_names.loc[:, 'Name':]` would select the column `Name` and all columns after `Name`.\n\n- **Alternative:** While `.loc` is invaluable when writing production code, it may be a little too verbose for interactive use. One recommended alternative is the `[]` method, which takes on the form `df['colname']`.\n\n#### Row Selection\n\nSimilarly, if we want to select a row by its label, we can use the same `.loc` method. In this case, the \"label\" of each row refers to the index (i.e. primary key) of the dataframe."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Example: 3.1.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"baby_names.loc[2:5, 'Name']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Example: 3.2.

This is really the main difference between the two functions and it is **important** that you remember the difference and why you might want to use one over the other. In addition, with `iloc[]`, the end index is **not** included, like with normal Python slicing.\n\n**Note:** As a mnemonic, remember that the i in `iloc` means \"integer\". \n\nBelow, we have sorted the `baby_names` dataframe. Notice how the **position** of a row is not necessarily equal to the **index** of a row. For example, the first row is not necessarily the row associated with index 1.

Filtering Data\n\n### Filtering with boolean arrays\n\nFiltering is the process of removing unwanted material.  In your quest for cleaner data, you will undoubtedly filter your data at some point: whether it be for clearing up cases with missing values, for culling out fishy outliers, or for analyzing subgroups of your data set.  Note that compound expressions have to be grouped with parentheses. Example usage looks like `df[df['column name'] < 5]]`.\n\nFor your reference, some commonly used comparison operators are given below.\n\nSymbol   | Usage      | Meaning \n------   | ---------- | -------------------------------------\n$==$     | a == b     | Does a equal b?\n$\\lt =$  | a >= b     | Is a less than or equal to b?\n$\\gt =$  | a >= b     | Is a greater than or equal to b?\n$\\lt$    | a < b      | Is a less than \n$\\gt$    | a > b      | Is a greater than b?\n~        | ~p         | Returns negation of p\n&#124;   | p &#124; q | p OR q\n&        | p & q      | p AND q\n^        | p ^ q      | p XOR q (exclusive or)\n\nIn the following we construct the DataFrame containing only names registered in North Carolina."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nc = baby_names[baby_names['State'] == 'NC']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Example 4.1.** To count the number of instances of each unique value in a Series, we can use the `value_counts()` method as `df['col_name'].value_counts()`.

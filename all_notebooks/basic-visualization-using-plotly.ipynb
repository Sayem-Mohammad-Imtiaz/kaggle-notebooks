By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### WHAT IS THE NEED OF VISUALIZATION?\n\n- We need data visualization simply because of human tendency to percieve visual summary of information better than numerical or tabular form. Visualization makes it easier to identify patterns and trends than looking through thousands of rows on a spreadsheet. It's the way the human brain works. Since the purpose of data analysis is to gain insights, data is much more valuable when it is visualized and as backed by studies done by several instiutions which conclusively proved that humans remember memory better than auditory memory.\n\n- It is important to keep in mind that in daily life what we remember is what we paid attention to and in general our eyes are drawn to colors and patterns and we recognise things better visually. We quickly can distinguish red from blue or green, square from circle or any other shape. From ancient times we relied more on visual, including everything from art and advertisements to TV and movies.\n\n- Data visualization is another form of visual art that grabs our interest and keeps our eyes on the message. When we see a chart, we quickly see trends and outliers. If we can see something, we internalize it quickly. It’s storytelling with a purpose. If you’ve ever stared at a massive spreadsheet of data and couldn’t see a trend, you know how much more effective a visualization can be.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### WHAT IS PLOTLY?\n\n#### Plotly is another visualization library that provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for individuals and collaboration, as well as scientific graphing libraries for Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino, and REST.\n\n### WHY USE PLOTLY WHEN WE HAVE MATPLOTLIB?\n\n#### A major advantage of using Plotly is that it encourages us to be as creative as possible with your visualization since any complex plots only use three main concepts: data, layout, and figure objects. As an engineer, this is probably one of the best things to have as we can build and rebuild graphs in any way we want.\n\n#### If you're still using Matplotlib to make data visualizations in Python, it's time to check out the view from an interactive visualization library.

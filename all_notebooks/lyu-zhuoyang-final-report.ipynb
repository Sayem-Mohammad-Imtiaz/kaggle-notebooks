So it shows that how many vaccinations per million for one day, and it also shows the change of the daily ratio.\n\nThe reason why I choose it is that I would like to see that would the country provide enough vaccine, and would citizen prefer to vaccinate, and the change of citizen consideration. I think ratio (in ppm) between vaccination number and total population for the current date can show what I want to see. If the country cannot provide enough vaccine, the ratio of course not to be so high. And if citizen do not like/afraid to vaccinate, the ratio would not be high. What's more, it is a daily data, we can see the change of the ratio which can show us, how citizen minds change and how hard the government try to get or product vaccine. \n\nFor example, from 2020-12-02 we can see that the ratio of US and EU is increase continuously, and it means that US can provide enough health system and US citizen also prefer to vaccine. And we can also guess that those developed countries are strong enough to provide good health system(vaccinate system).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Create a global map of earthquake occurrences worldwide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/201001-earthquake/query.csv',header=0)\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df['time'])\ndf['time'] = df.index.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:00:00')\ndf = df.sort_index()\nfig = px.scatter_geo(df,lat='latitude',lon='longitude',color='mag',animation_frame='time',color_continuous_scale='rainbow',range_color=(1.0,5.0))\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-02T08:18:54.340954Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-02T08:18:54.341395Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-02T08:18:54.976383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-02T08:18:54.34136Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-02T08:18:54.974812Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the news, I notice that in January 12 2010, Haiti happened a big earthquake and caused lots of people died. So I would like to see the earthquake happened around 2010 January 12. And want to find that how many times of aftershocks.\n\nFrom the news, we can know that a magnitude 7.0 earthquake attacked Haiti which caused about 250,000 people died and at least another 300,000 people were injured. And there were two aftershocks happened after this earthquake.\n\nIt almost destory the city locate in the center of the earthquake that 80%-90% of the buildings were critically damaged or destroyed.  About 1.5 million individuals were forced to live in makeshift internally displaced person camps. \n\nAnd because that many hospitals can not be used, the survivors have to wait days for treatment.\n\nPersonal consideration:\n\nTo those place where have high risk of earthquake, the government need to prepare emergency measures, and should try to recover the health system back to usable immediately. Compare with Japan earthquake in 2011 March 11th, the magnitude of Japan's case is 9.0 and happened in the captial city which is higher than Haiti's cass, the number of the death for Haiti is quite higher than Japan. So it shows that to be the high risk place of earthquake, Japan prepared well, and the prevention work is surely valid and can decrease the damage. And I think other countries need to study the measures of Japan.\n\nreference:\n\nhttps://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2010-haiti-earthquake-facts#:~:text=of%20Wikimedia%20Commons)-,Fast%20facts%3A%202010%20Haiti%20earthquake,least%20300%2C000%20people%20were%20injured.\nhttps://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2010-haiti-earthquake-facts\nhttps://escweb.wr.usgs.gov/share/mooney/142.pdf\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

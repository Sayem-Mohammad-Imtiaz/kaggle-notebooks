Psychol., 14 February 2019 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00203\n\n\"The social identity approach to wellbeing posits that social identifications provide psychological resources that contribute to individual wellbeing. Unless individuals identify with stigmatized groups or groups whose norms prescribe damaging behaviors, identifying with groups seems beneficial.\"\n\n\"Studies show that people whose self-esteem is high tend to project their positive self-evaluation onto their social identities. In addition, the positive belief about the in-group, which we label in-group satisfaction, is associated with the belief that positive characteristics of individuals should be used to enhance the valuable in-group. Thus, in-group satisfaction seems to be associated with positive and prosocial emotionality. Moreover, this association is reciprocal.\n\n\"For example, longitudinal studies showed that high self-esteem and sense of personal control measured in Time 1 increased in-group satisfaction assessed in Time 2. However, in-group satisfaction measured in Time 1 also increased self-esteem and the sense of personal control measured in Time 2. Importantly, previous studies showed that in-group satisfaction suppressed the negative link between collective narcissism and self-esteem. Thus, the overlap with in-group satisfaction may offer a possibility to change negative emotionality associated with collective narcissism.\"\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00203/full","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.marsja.se/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how_to_load_spss_files_python_pandas-2.jpg)marsja.se","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pyreadstat","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-10T22:01:43.031124Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-10T22:01:43.03188Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-10T22:01:53.126544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-10T22:01:43.031832Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-10T22:01:53.125465Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pyreadstat","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-10T22:14:45.507708Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-10T22:14:45.508047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-10T22:14:45.513015Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-10T22:14:45.508013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-10T22:14:45.512006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#I couldn't apply the line below with all the sav files.

Beginning operation in August 2013 as Bay Area Bike Share, the Ford GoBike system currently has over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose. On June 28, 2017, the system officially launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.\n\nFord GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. The bikes are available for use 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 365 days/year and riders have access to all bikes in the network when they become a member or purchase a pass.\n"},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import all packages and set plots to be embedded inline\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sb\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ford-gobike-data/2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"user_type\"].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"member_gender\"].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['start_time']=pd.to_datetime(df['start_time'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['end_time']=pd.to_datetime(df['end_time'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is the structure of your dataset?\n\nThere are 519700 trips in the dataset with 15 features ('duration_sec', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'start_station_id',\n 'start_station_name', 'start_station_latitude','start_station_longitude', 'end_station_id', 'end_station_name',\n 'end_station_latitude', 'end_station_longitude', 'bike_id', 'user_type','member_birth_year', 'member_gender').

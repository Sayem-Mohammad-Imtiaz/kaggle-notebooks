Revenue from earlier months of the year was much lower than later months. \n\nWith only 9 days in Dec 2011, revenue reached 0.42 million GBP, from my prediction, it could get up to 1.5 million by the end of the month due to holiday season. If that prediction is accurate, the earnings of Dec 2011 would be doubled of Dec the previous year. Another assumption is, this was a new business. \n\nThe foreign market of the business is surrounding European countries and Australia (!).

It looks like there were a couple of big contracts (or input mistakes) they were likely to make but then got cancelled. \n\nMany of other outliners dropped to the range of 20K GBP, which is way larger than an average bill of any normal person to buy for their home. In other words, they do business with other business as well. \n\nZooming into the smaller range (The 2nd boxplot), the number of outliners still significant. Even though the invoice values are not much varied over months, but the daily revenue distribution over months (Box plot 3rd) are significantly different from months to months. Concretely, these outliners have effected strongly on daily income. There is not enough data to conclude, but I can predict that B2B had a big impact on this business. Taking good care of them would be the core strategy.

For this business and the dataset available, I will estimate CLTV by the granular formula, which is driven by how frequency a customer purchases with the business, what are their average value per purchase and the estimate customer lifespan. \n\nCustomer lifespan is a critical metric which heavily depended on the business model itself. When it comes to customer lifespan, itâ€™s important to understand the difference between being a contractual and non-contractual business. Most online-stores are non-contractual businesses, it means, when a transaction is made, it is effectively over.

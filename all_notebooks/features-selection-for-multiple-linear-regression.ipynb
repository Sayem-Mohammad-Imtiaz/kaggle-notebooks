This implies that a model that uses TV and radio expenditures to predict sales is substantially better than one that uses only TV advertising.  \n\nHowever, this simple model may be incorrect. Suppose that spending money on radio advertising actually increases the effectiveness of TV advertising, so that the slope term for TV should increase as radio increases. In this situation, given a fixed budget of $100K spending half on radio and half on TV may increase sales more than allocating the entire amount to either TV or to radio.  \n\nIn marketing, this is known as a **synergy effect.** The figure above suggests that such an effect may be present in the advertising data. Notice that when levels of either TV or radio are low, then the true sales are lower than predicted by the linear model. But when advertising is split between the two media, then the model tends to underestimate sales.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3a4a536a-b874-6349-693c-a7387b2726c2","_uuid":"b0ad37312110ef7ac96adc7cd78549573a35fcd6","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"modelSynergy = sm.ols('Sales ~ TV + Radio + TV*Radio', ad).fit()\nmodelSynergy.summary().tables[1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"160d266a-1983-c524-bf21-e9dadeceb092","_uuid":"54f8940f42e27b3c04a378ed8681ec39c8e7f89b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The results strongly suggest that the model that includes the interaction term is superior to the model that contains only main effects.

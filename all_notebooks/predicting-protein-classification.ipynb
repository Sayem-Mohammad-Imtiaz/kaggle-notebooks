The majority of the data records are of proteins. With DNA being the precursor to RNA, which when translated, proteins are the biomolecules that are directly interacting in biological pathways and cycles. Proteins are usually centered around one or a few job which is defined by their family type. For example, we can have a protein that is from a Hydrolase group, which focuses on catalyzing hydrolysis (breaking bonds by adding water) in order to help promote destruction of chains of proteins, or other molecules. Another example would be a protein that is a transport protein, which allows other molecules such as sucrose, fructose, or even water come in and outside of the cell. \n\n## Goals\nWith these proteins having different family types, a question arises if it's possible to determine a protein's family type based on sequence. There are notable search engines such as BLAST which has this capability, but it'd be interesting to see if a machine learning approach can do a good job in classifying a protein's family based on the protein sequence.\n\n### 1).

Train Test Split\nAfter finally filtering the dataset, a split on the data to create a training and testing set must be performed. After splitting the data, it's important to utilize the CountVectorizer to create a dictionary composed from the training dataset. This will extract individual characters or subsets of characters to gain features. An important note about using the CountVectorizer is the specification of the ngram_range. \n\nIn a protein, it's not the individual amino acid in the protein that gives identification to what it's purpose is. There are secondary and tertiary structures that are formed via the bonds of the amino acids in the sequence. Furthermore, different parts of the chain can be more basic, and others can be more acidic, indicating it's important to use features that are larger than just one unit. As a result, using an ngram_range of (4,4) seems to be a legitmate choice for feature extraction. This will extract different subsets that are of length 4 allowing the amino acids to use their neighbors to aid in our classification."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ceb4937bcf92b132ee71e071128e119c524f877","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"0ed06df1-10c5-49b1-95ce-582a3f5dc409","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Could add n-grams\n## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18658106/quick-implementation-of-character-n-grams-using-python\n# jump_size !=1 -> less overlap in n-grams. \ndef char_grams(text,n=3,jump_size=2):\n    return [text[i:i+n] for i in range(0,len(text)-n+1,jump_size)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e24ff6750f2cfab7b28d5bd61088d31f22d79311","_cell_guid":"ce7c4a6d-f02b-4b86-aebe-5f3cca04ae0d","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head(3).sequence.apply(char_grams)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0fbcf65790fa2ddabc2da4b9f7cb66c7147ccec0","_cell_guid":"5a389ac0-fef6-4541-9d24-a90902c026bb","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data[\"3mers\"] = data.sequence.apply(char_grams)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b25f114a470b0e3502fff8e35bb472d08c204997","_cell_guid":"c4bb6c49-5fb3-4b6b-90f3-2cb4db9f6fc6","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2077ac3cfd9e1aaca6f17b291adcae0193fcf8c2","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"5cd38427-9c38-4fb6-b0d4-9943e8c3420c","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.to_csv(\"protein_classification_46k_ngrams.csv.gz\",compression=\"gzip\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f8a42be5947d434153c78d3b55cb40ec292bebdf","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"2f112664-a654-4e6b-bf70-e9ac8e5ccc61","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"866ea95a148aefd8fa11c32ac7a1c170c9a66259","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c3be5f30-884a-4ed4-8e5e-a6ae85feccc9","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"114ea850cc1601b8ff6b8572a82ab3400c0ec1a3","_cell_guid":"40ce99f2-f588-4cf1-8881-7a3b7a611e47","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# 3). ----- Train Test Split -----\n\n# Split Data\nX_train, X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(data['sequence'], data['classification'], test_size = 0.2, random_state = 1)\n\n# Create a Count Vectorizer to gather the unique elements in sequence\nvect = CountVectorizer(analyzer = 'char_wb', ngram_range = (4,4))\n\n# Fit and Transform CountVectorizer\nvect.fit(X_train)\nX_train_df = vect.transform(X_train)\nX_test_df = vect.transform(X_test)\n\n#Print a few of the features\nprint(vect.get_feature_names()[-20:])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dca1c75dde0c093050a44c40b729f2975ce4f475","_cell_guid":"d5b4a828-a058-41c4-906d-b19c79f95846"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4).

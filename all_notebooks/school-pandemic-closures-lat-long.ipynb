Home learning environments and social reproduction during school closures in Ireland\n\nAuthors: Gretta Mohan, Eamonn Carroll, Selina McCoy, Ciarán Mac Domhnaill & Georgiana Mihut\n\nIrish Educational Studies  -Volume 40, 2021 - Issue 2: COVID-19 and Education: Positioning the Pandemic; Facing the Future. \n\n\"This paper presents research on the resources and supports available for students to engage with learning in their home environments. Evidence from a nationally representative survey comprising one third of second-level school leaders, conducted during the first school closures in 2020, shows that attendance and engagement appears to be influenced by the educational level of parents/guardians.\"\n\n\"More than three quarters of school leaders reported school attendance worsened during the closures period. Reduced student engagement across the whole school was reported by 70% of schools, and 65% reported negative effects on engagement for Junior Certificate students and over half reported such among Leaving Certificate students.\"\n\n\"Where the classroom presents a (roughly) equal learning environment for all students, the HLE was characterised by the largely unique experience of every household. Families had differential access to suitable devices and broadband, and varying degrees of appropriate space shared between different numbers of children and, where they were working from home, parents as well.\"\n\n\"Parental support became even more important in the absence of normal school structures to encourage or enforce student attendance and engagement. The long-term benefits of remaining engaged became more intangible for those struggling from day to day.\"\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/03323315.2021.1915841\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03323315.2021.1915841","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQepj7Z1YAsGV_8YTtIDzOoSSBWHCJ6YHbPL3YlirsdBJrTqlMqclnjPUYL6g7P_TTT23Q&usqp=CAU)hse.ru","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsclosurecsv/closure.csv',encoding ='ISO-8859-1',sep=\";\")\ndf.tail()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T22:38:39.329831Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T22:38:39.330271Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T22:38:39.389261Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T22:38:39.330236Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T22:38:39.388372Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T22:39:38.315013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T22:39:38.315401Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T22:39:38.326619Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T22:39:38.315369Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T22:39:38.325507Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"As schools reopen for all students, the importance of these findings mainly lies in what they mean for students’ return to the classroom.\"\n\n\"Student engagement and attendance during the lockdown existed along a spectrum, and each of the factors above influenced student’s capacity and motivation to attend, but no single factor determined it completely. Along this spectrum, it is clear that vulnerable students’ HLEs (home learning environments:HLEs) were generally less conducive to engaging with remote education.\"\n\n\"Considering this through a social reproduction lens, the closure of school buildings has most likely strengthened the transmission of privilege through the different resources available to different families to respond to the crisis. Unless schools can make up for the disruption, differential losses of learning during the distance learning periods are expected to ripple through students’ educational trajectories and into their later life.\"\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03323315.2021.1915841","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Parul Pandey  https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/a-guide-to-handling-missing-values-in-python\n\n\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\ndf_most_frequent = df.copy()\n#setting strategy to 'mean' to impute by the mean\nmean_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')# strategy can also be mean or median \ndf_most_frequent.iloc[:,:] = mean_imputer.fit_transform(df_most_frequent)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T22:52:45.526344Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T22:52:45.526824Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T22:52:45.854306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T22:52:45.526787Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T22:52:45.852867Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_most_frequent.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T22:53:05.8839Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T22:53:05.884318Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T22:53:05.897085Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T22:53:05.884282Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T22:53:05.896089Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Remove the commas to dots from latitude and longitude.

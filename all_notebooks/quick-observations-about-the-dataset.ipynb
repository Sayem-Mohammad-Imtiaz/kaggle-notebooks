On the other hand, the 787 Dreamliner is a much better commercial success across multiple airlines. \n* This being said the overall trend for the future is for the industry to lean more towards airbus planes (the percentage of new orders favor Airbus overall vs Boeing)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7adfcdfc-0f19-96f2-b81c-1c73ea30d1d5"},"source":"Data Manipulation\n=============="},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"39d56dca-fe9a-de08-5c29-ca142004e2f8"},"outputs":[],"source":"library(ggplot2) # Data visualization\nlibrary(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nsystem(\"ls ../input\")\ndata <- read_csv(\"../input/Fleet Data.csv\")\n\n#making the data easier to deal with\ncolnames(data) <- c(\"parent_airline\",\"airline\",\"aircraft_type\",\"current\",\"future\",\"historic\",\"total\",\"orders\",\"unit_cost\",\"total_cost\",\"average_age\")\n#nrow(data)\ndata$total_cost <- as.numeric(gsub(\",\",\"\",substring(data$total_cost,2)))\ndata$unit_cost <- as.numeric(gsub(\",\",\"\",substring(data$unit_cost,2)))\ndata$plane_brand <- word(data$aircraft_type,1)\ndata <- data %>% mutate(newcost=ifelse(!is.na(orders),orders*unit_cost,0))\n\n#adding flags for airbus and boeing\ndata <- data %>% mutate(airbus=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Airbus\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(boeing=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Boeing\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(embraer=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Embraer\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(bombardier=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Bombardier\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(mitsubishi=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Mitsubishi\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(embraer=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Embraer\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(comac=ifelse(plane_brand %in% c(\"COMAC\",\"comac\"),ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(mcdonnell=ifelse(plane_brand==\"McDonnell\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(canadair=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Canadair\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(atr=ifelse(plane_brand==\"ATR\",ifelse(is.na(current),0,current),0))\n\n#table(data$plane_brand)\n\n#adding flags for future airbus and future boeing\ndata <- data %>% mutate(airbus_future=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Airbus\",ifelse(is.na(orders),0,orders),0))\ndata <- data %>% mutate(boeing_future=ifelse(plane_brand==\"Boeing\",ifelse(is.na(orders),0,orders),0))\n\n#The below list is not exhaustive.\nlowcostcarriers<- c(\"AirAsia X\",\"Gol Linhas Aereas\",\"Azul\",\"Tigerair Australia\",\"Volaris\",\"Interjet\",\"Spirit Airlines\",\"Frontier Airlines\",\"Allegiant Air\",\"WestJet\",\"Air Canada Rouge\",\"FlyDubai\",\"Up\",\"Monarch Airlines\",\"Jet2\",\"Flybe\",\"Vueling\",\"Iberia Express\",\"Pobeda\",\"Transavia\",\"Germanwings\",\"Eurowings\",\"easyJet\",\"Wizz Air\",\"Lion Air\",\"IndiGo\", \"Southwest Airlines\", \"RyanAir\",\"AirAsia\",\"LionAir\",\"JetBlue Airways\",\"Norwegian Air\",\"WestJet\",\"Pegasus Airlines\",\"Flybe\",\"SpiceJet\",\"Air Arabia Egypt\",\"Air Arabia Maroc\",\"Air Cairo\",\"Jambojet Limited\",\"Mango\",\"China United Airlines\",\"Spring Airlines\",\"Cebu Pacific Air\",\"Jetstar Airways\",\"AirAsia India\",\"AirAsia Japan\")\ndata$type <- NA\ndata <- data %>% mutate(type=ifelse(airline %in% lowcostcarriers,\"Low Cost\",\"Traditional\"))\n\nhead(data %>% filter(type==\"Low Cost\"))\nlength(unique(data$airline))\nlength(unique(data$parent_airline))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"772e9bc7-5000-8651-7916-11375bf15eeb"},"source":"Largest Airlines\n============"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2a17b8b8-9210-b5df-7944-91a7bd2347c6"},"source":"Let's find which airlines have the largest fleets"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0384e244-f1ee-10aa-b438-427903e6ab04"},"outputs":[],"source":"#lets find out which airlines have the largest fleets\nairline_fleet <- data %>% group_by(airline) %>% summarise(fleet=sum(current,na.rm=TRUE),historic=sum(historic,na.rm=TRUE),orders=sum(orders,na.rm=TRUE),ratio=100*(orders/fleet),current_fleet_cost=sum(total_cost,na.rm=TRUE),value_per_fleet_unit=current_fleet_cost/fleet)\nairline_fleet <- airline_fleet %>% mutate(type=ifelse(airline %in% lowcostcarriers,\"Low Cost\",\"Traditional\")) \nhead(airline_fleet %>% arrange(desc(fleet)))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c868a1a0-bb4d-bd8e-f2d2-c54f2687e975"},"source":"Unsurprisingly, American airlines are leading the pack.

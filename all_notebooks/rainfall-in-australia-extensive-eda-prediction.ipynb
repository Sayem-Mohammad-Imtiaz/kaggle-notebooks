This techinque will be most of the times better than just median or a mean imputation. Afterwards these features will be standardize with a MinMaxscaler to remain standardized positive values. (A Standard scaler would also create ngeative values.)\n\n  More practical info on MICE: https://machinelearningmastery.com/iterative-imputation-for-missing-values-in-machine-learning/ .\n\n\n\n    The second subpipe\n- The second subpipe is for the right skewed distibutions:\n      - WindSpeed9am\n      - WindSpeed3pm\n      - WindGustSpeed\n      - Evaporation\n\n  These features will be transformed with a Powertransformer and afterwards imputed with the median and standardized with the MinMaxScaler.\n\n\n    The third subpipe\n\n- The third subpipe is to convert the features Rainfall and sunshine to variables with ordinal numbers. Because these values have a lot of zeros. Moreover, Rainfall also has a lot of outliers. The pipe will have median imputation before being converted to bins.\n\n\n    The fourth subpipe\n- The fourth subpipe will be an imputation pipe for the ordinal features. The pipe will have a 'most frequent' (mode) imputation. \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPoint 3: The categorical pipe\n\nThe categorical features will be encoded using a one-hot encoder\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nPoint 4: Feature Engineering pipe\n\nTo add additional features, the difference is calculated between the Windspeed in the morning and afternoon. More wind mostly means a change in the weather.\nFuthermore, the difference is calculated in the min and max temp on a day and difference in humidity during the day.\n\nThe pipe will consist of imputation with the median, apply a custom transformer to create the new features and lastly, to standardize these features with a MinMaxscaler.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nPoint 5: The target column\n\nThe target variable has a ratio of 1:3 in terms of the distribution of \"Yes\" and \"No\". So a convenient solution for this would be to do apply the \"Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique\". The minority class will be oversampled to create a more balanced distribution.\n\nNOTE: The SMOTE must be performed DURING the Cross Validation. If SMOTE is performed performed before Cross Validation (only once). There will be an overfit on the synthesized data.\nHandy sources: \n\n    https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/\n\n\n    https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets#Test-Data-with-Logistic-Regression:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nA picture of the whole pipe will be displayed after the code for the pipe\n_________________________________________________________________________\n","metadata":{"id":"Yc1QwusLkFqi"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Pipelines for the Columntransformer (Used for Train and test data)","metadata":{"id":"WLPK5su9KDUo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Custom transformer for feature engineering\n\nIdeas:\n\n- Difference between windspeed 9am and 3pm\n- Difference between humidity 9am and 3pm\n- Difference Min and Max temp","metadata":{"id":"maphLzN19GFJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Custom transformer to add columns\n#This transformer calculates the difference in temp, windspeed and humidity on different time periods\n\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n\nminTemp_ix, maxTemp_ix, humidity_9_ix, humidity_3_ix, windspeed_9_ix, windspeed_3_ix = 0,1,2,3,4,5\n\nclass ColumnAdd(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\n    def __init__(self): # no *args or **kargs\n        pass\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        return self  # nothing else to do\n    def transform(self, X):\n        diff_temp = np.abs(X[:,minTemp_ix] - X[:,maxTemp_ix])\n        diff_humidity = np.abs(X[:,humidity_9_ix] - X[:,humidity_3_ix])\n        diff_windspeed = np.abs(X[:,windspeed_9_ix] - X[:,windspeed_3_ix])\n        \n        return np.c_[diff_temp, diff_humidity, diff_windspeed] # transformer returns a np array","metadata":{"id":"o0u2_29gXCJE","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pipeline to transform numeric columns\n\nTo make better imputations than just the mean, the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations is used instead of just a mean/median imputation.

So that's what we are going to do. This tip is effective because it creates more samples that are more plausible. BUT, since we already have a descent ratio (ratio = 1/3) undersampling of the majority class is not necessary.\n\nsource:\n\n    https://machinelearningmastery.com/iterative-imputation-for-missing-values-in-machine-learning/","metadata":{"id":"a7G_IMUyiBvj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"oversample = SMOTE()\nX_train_sampled, y_train_sampled = oversample.fit_resample(X_processed, y_processed)","metadata":{"id":"j7NINHJ7r38p","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.hist(y_train_sampled)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"EthN9Y_7_hNX","outputId":"fb2258d3-6115-457c-a4e7-7c2f784e1177","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# import estimators","metadata":{"id":"r-GrKdIab16H"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing estimators\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier # Standard SGD is with SVCLinear\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n#from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n\n# import CV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score","metadata":{"id":"y8lTr0KBsDHT","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Training the models\n\nGlobal inspection of the CV scores","metadata":{"id":"nfL4vFeSpZbA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# create dict of models\ndef get_models():\n  models = dict()\n  models['log'] = LogisticRegression()\n  models['knn'] = KNeighborsClassifier()\n  models['xgb'] = XGBClassifier()\n  models['sgd'] = SGDClassifier()\n  models['mlp'] = MLPClassifier()\n  return models","metadata":{"id":"ugYVFKPBurGu","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def evaluate_model(model, X, y):\n  cv = StratifiedKFold()\n  scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='roc_auc', cv=cv, n_jobs=-1, error_score='raise')\n  return scores","metadata":{"id":"bCQTGGiCw6zd","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the models to evaluate\nmodels = get_models()\n# evaluate the models and store results\nresults, names = list(), list()\nfor name, model in models.items():\n\n  # original pipe adjusted to train on the train data with SMOTE (only applicable on the train data)\n  imb_pipe = imblearn_pipeline([\n                                ('preprocess', preprocess_pipe),\n                                ('SMOTE', SMOTE()),\n                                (name, model)\n  ])\n  scores = evaluate_model(imb_pipe, X_train, y_processed)\n  results.append(scores)\n  names.append(name)\n  print('>%s %.3f (%.3f)' % (name, np.mean(scores), np.std(scores)))\n# plot model performance for comparison\nplt.boxplot(results, labels=names, showmeans=True)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"m4nMtDukyNdO","outputId":"68005989-a1b8-4a6d-d41c-cdb0cefa1a50","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Several models are around the same auc scores.

It is entirely heuristical, but might help to estimate how many steps you would need;\n\n- Always back up your results into Trials object, and possibly pickle it to hard drive. It is very frustrating to lose several hours of optimization due to a power cut or OS freezing;\n\n- Check carefully sign of your target function. Shouldn't a minus be there?\n\n- Don't use full capacity of your model for hyperparameter tuning. This means: your don't need 1000 trees in your XGBoost, nor do you need all 8 million samples of your training set. It is very unlikely that optimization on a reduced set/capacity would yield significantly different results, while computation time would be much lower;\n\n- MOST IMPORTANT: Never substitute proper feature engineering with extensive hyperparameter optimization. Former is much more important - untuned model with great features easily outperforms heavily optimized model without intelligent design. Do some EDA, try things, find out what works, what might work and what is garbage, and then, before you go to sleep - launch optimization for the night.

Studies have shown that 30%–59% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, which poses tremendous infection control challenges. To control asymptomatic infections, China implemented active case surveillance and enhanced social distancing measures, which include contact tracing, quarantine for key populations, medical observation, and curtailed social activities. However, additional information on the characteristics of presymptomatic transmission is needed to develop targeted control and prevention guidance.\n\nAsymptomatic COVID-19 cases were found mainly through close contact screening, clustered epidemic investigations, follow-up investigation of infection sources, and active surveillance of key populations with travel or residence history in areas with continuous transmission of COVID-19 in China and abroad.\n\nThe authors estimated secondary attack rate (SAR) and 95% CI based on the proportion of COVID-19 incidence among close contacts. They calculated the mean reproductive number (R0) from the number of secondary infections observed among close contacts of each index case. \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392433/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\nimport squarify\nimport matplotlib\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a total of 359 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 83 (23%) persons were asymptomatic at diagnosis; 71 (86%) of whom later developed symptoms. \n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Close contacts, Family Members and infections via Nucleic Acid Testing </font>\n\nAmong presymptomatic cases, 38 had >1 (range 1–90, median 4) close contact.

Okres inkubacji SARS -CoV-2 warunkuje szybkie tempo rozprzestrzeniania się zakażenia i brak możliwości skutecznej kontroli nad przebiegiem choroby COVID-19. Dlatego niezbędne jest podejmowanie natychmiastowych i skutecznych działań ograniczających ekspozycję na transmisję zakażenia.\n\nPracownicy ochrony zdrowia oraz służb ratowniczych i  porządkowych są grupami zawodowymi podwyższonego ryzyka zakażenia SARS -CoV-2, dlatego istnieje realna potrzeba wypracowania klarownych procedur postępowania w  przypadku podejrzenia/potwierdzenia infekcji u  osoby, której udziela się pomocy. Potrzebne są też zabezpieczenie tych pracowników odpowiednimi środkami barierowymi i edukacja w zakresie ich stosowania (zwłaszcza zdejmowania), a także monitorowanie ich statusu serologicznego. Jednym z najważniejszych obecnie kierunków badawczych jest opracowywanie szczepionki anty-COVID-19.

But one thing will stay the same—the hierarchy of hazard controls. Michelle Strange, MSDH, RDH, explains how to implement these infection controls.\n\n### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">During the fight against TUBERCULOSIS, the Hierarchy of Hazard Controls has been updated</font></mark></b>\n\nSince its establishment during the 1990 fight against TUBERCULOSIS, the hierarchy of hazard controls has been updated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe hierarchy of controls has since seen the country through severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS), Ebola, and Zika outbreaks, proving its effectiveness. However, it only works if dental health-care settings understand and follow the recommendations and regulations. \n\nRegrettably, the dental profession has not been fully implementing these safety precautions. A 2017 systematic scoping review of the use of bioaerosols in dentistry and health care found that even in the absence of infectious disease outbreaks, dental environments put workers at higher risks of acquiring infectious diseases. To keep ourselves, our patients, and even our loved ones safe, here are some simple ways to put the hierarchy of hazard controls into practice.\n\nThe hierarchy of infection controls begins with the elimination or removal of risk and substitution, which swaps out potential risk factors for practices or processes less likely to cause infection. These are the most effective ways of controlling the environment. The next step is to engineer the removal of the hazard, followed by administration controls that attempt to protect when it is not possible to remove the risk. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the last defense in the hierarchy, and it requires the previous steps to be in place to be most effective.\n\nAs the types of infections and risks evolve, so do the methods of containment and control. It is essential to stay up to date with changes in regulations and requirements to provide the best possible protection in your environment. \nhttps://www.rdhmag.com/infection-control/article/14185691/thanks-to-covid19-we-are-discussing-the-hierarchy-of-hazard-controls-for-dentistry"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(x=\"Entry\",data=df,palette=\"GnBu_d\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.yticks(rotation=45)\nplt.title(\"Entry\")\n# changing the font size\nsns.set(font_scale=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b><mark style=\"background-color: #9B59B6\"><font color=\"white\">Hierarchy of Hazard Controls</font></mark></b>\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">ELIMINATION</font>\n\nWith global infectious disease outbreaks per year more than tripling since 1980, we cannot continue with our usual ways anymore.\n\nInstead, we need to set up a screening process to check both employees and patients before they arrive at the office. \n\nThis may be as simple as having a strict protocol: if individuals or anyone in their households are unwell or recovering, especially from acute upper respiratory infections, they should STAY HOME. \n\nOur work and oral health are vital, but even these can take a temporary back seat when individuals are possibly contagious. The CDC has clear recommendations on staying home when we are sick, including remaining at home for at least 24 hours after being free of fever in the case of influenza-like illnesses. \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">SUBSTITUTION</font>\n\n\nFor vital dental procedures, elimination is not always an option. Instead, consider controlling the situation via substitution—i.e., replacement with a safer alternative. \n\nSubstitution can be a forgotten rung on the ladder of controls to reduce potential exposure risks. Before attempting to treat a possibly contagious patient, it is always a good first step to ask if there is a better substitution for the procedure.  \n\nIf there is no option other than treatment for a patient who is possibly contagious, don a respirator and ensure that you, your team, and the environment are as protected as possible. \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">ENGINEERING CONTROLS</font>\n\n\nThe third preferred approach to deal with hazards is engineering controls—i.e., using mechanical tools or barriers to isolate the hazard from people. Most essential dental procedures will likely produce contaminated aerosols, spatters, or sprays, so controlling and containing these fluids before they reach practitioners or begin traveling through the air is crucial. \n\nEngineering controls are essential, as they help us perform the work we need to and promote safety.\n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">ADMINSTRATIVE (work practice)CONTROLS</font>\n\n\nSimilar to having seat belts in a car but not clicking them into place before driving, administrative controls, also known as work practice controls, are employer-dictated measures—i.e., policies and procedures that change the way the dental team works so as to lessen or avoid hazard exposure. For instance, if you have HVE available and the recommendation is that you utilize it during procedures with spatter or aerosol production, the work practice control would be that you actually use it. Having a sharps container but then tossing a needle into the garbage is another example of having engineering controls but not proper work practice controls. \n\nStandard operating procedures (SOPs) are useful to make sure work practice controls are implemented. SOPs can help employees quickly visualize and understand the processes for tasks, even in complicated procedures, thus eliminating repetitive questions.\n \n\n<font color=\"#2ECC71\">PPE - PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</font>\n\n\nThe CDC’s hierarchy of controls4 ranks categories of hazard controls from most to least effective, and PPE is its last-recommended line of defense. Although PPE is a critical protective mechanism (just ask any hospital worker now), we cannot expect it to be our sole defense, a foolproof mechanism, or work beyond its capacity. The FDA reminds us, “a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.”\n\n\nIt is vital to understand that not all PPE is created equally. Not all surgical masks undergo the same testing criteria. Surgical masks have different levels of bacterial filtration and fluid resistance. Wearing a surgical mask without knowing the level of fluid resistance for the procedure being performed is not recommended. \n\nShould patients contract diseases from our dental offices, these cases will be considered health-care-associated infections, and there are consequences for practices that do not take infection control seriously, including possible financial penalties. \nhttps://www.rdhmag.com/infection-control/article/14185691/thanks-to-covid19-we-are-discussing-the-hierarchy-of-hazard-controls-for-dentistry"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ax = df['Study Type'].value_counts().plot.barh(figsize=(14, 6))\nax.set_title('Study Type Distribution', size=18)\nax.set_ylabel('Study Type', size=14)\nax.set_xlabel('Count', size=14)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1.1\"></a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Elderly living by themselves: measures to prevent Covid-19</h3>\n\nElderly individuals living by themselves: knowledge and measures to prevent the novel coronavirus\n\nAuthors: Darlene Mara dos Santos Tavares, Nayara Gomes Nunes Oliveira, Gianna Fiori Marchiori, Mariana Silva Freitas Guimarães, Lenniara Pereira Mendes Santana - \nRev.

Despite being the gold‐standard for the treatment of selected individuals with severe obesity, there is scarce information on whether or not bariatric surgery modifies the prognosis of people living with obesity in the current COVID‐19 pandemic.\n\nThe authors provide evidence of the importance of diabetes itself as a risk factor for severe COVID‐19.\n\nThe study describes the prevalence of symptom‐based likelihood of COVID‐19 (CL group) with a retrospective comparison of the characteristics at baseline and at 1 year post procedure in a survey‐based analysis of 738 patients who had bariatric surgery prior to the pandemic. Symptoms suggesting COVID‐19 occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients while, at the time of the survey, a global estimation reported an estimated prevalence of COVID‐19 cases of 9.9% ((3)).\n\nFour among the sixty‐two patients (6.4%) had severe COVID‐19 requiring hospitalization, and one of them (1.6%) died, which means that even with a similar symptomatic infection rate, mortality was significantly below that observed in patients with obesity not treated with surgery ((4)). The mechanisms potentially underlying this effect are unknown but may be multifactorial.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">BMI (Body mass index). Diabetes. Glycemic Control. Functional malnutrition </font>\n\nOn the other hand, the CL (COVID‐19–likely) group presented a lower BMI at the time of lockdown, with a higher percentage of weight loss since surgery. Severe forms of COVID‐19 requiring hospitalization were associated with persistent type 2 diabetes at the last follow‐up visit. This fact may add argument to the independent risk factor relevance of diabetes itself in association with COVID‐19 severity.\n\nA second factor was the lower BMI observed in the CL (COVID‐19–likely) group, which seems counterintuitive. Although no experimental evidence has been gathered in this line, patients with functional malnutrition post surgery may be at higher risk for severe COVID‐19. Functional malnutrition is most frequently observed in patients who are lost to follow‐up, thereby stressing the importance of long‐term care following bariatric surgery.\n\nThe improved glycemic control seem to protect people living with obesity from more severe COVID‐19.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33021051/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTcAsyRgI7lhY2xo3TNXHGp4sEBJ1KGZP1VHA&usqp=CAU/)atulpeters.com"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.crosstab(df.Factors,df.Matches).plot(kind=\"bar\",figsize=(20,6),color=['#0000ff','#000000' ])\nplt.title('Preventing Secondary Transmission')\nplt.xlabel('Factors')\nplt.ylabel('Matches')\nplt.legend([\"Factors\"])\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1.1\"></a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Declines in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission by Implementing of Mitigation Measures.</h3>\n\n\nDeclines in SARS-CoV-2 Transmission, Hospitalizations, and Mortality After Implementation of Mitigation Measures— Delaware, March–June 2020\n\nAuthors: Florence A.

Case investigations. Contact Tracing.</font>\n\nThe relationship among implementation of mitigation strategies, case investigations, and contact tracing and COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalization and mortality was examined during March–June 2020. Incidence declined by 82%, hospitalization by 88%, and mortality by 100% from late April to June 2020, as the mask mandate and contact tracing were added to case investigations and the stay-at-home order.\n\nImplementation of mitigation measures, including mandated mask use coupled with public health interventions, was followed by reductions in COVID-19 incidence and associated hospitalizations and mortality. The combination of state-mandated community mitigation efforts and routine public health interventions can reduce the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Patients refused to name contacts or could not recall contacts.</font>\n\nAmong 6,527 interviewed patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, 5,390 (83%) either refused to name contacts or could not recall contacts. The mean number of contacts reported per patient who reported one or more contacts was 2.5 (IQR = 1–3).\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Causes for not interviewing contacts: Contact did not respond to call attempts, no available phone number, refused, a non-Delaware resident</font>\n\nOverall, 161 (18%) of the 882 contacts who were reached experienced symptoms during quarantine and were urged to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Reasons for not interviewing contacts included that the contact did not respond to call attempts (265, 14%), had no available phone number (208, 11%), refused (88, 5%), was a non-Delaware resident (20, 1%), or other reasons (406, 22%).\n\n<font color=\"#EC7063\">Mitigation Measures: Stay Home, Mandated Mask use in Public.

It is unclear whether it has similar effects on ACE2 in lung endothelium. With ACE2 being key in the pathophysiologic findings of infection with SARS-CoV-2, Their findings are intriguing.\nhttps://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692(20)31654-8/fulltext"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Sharlto Cope https://www.kaggle.com/dwin183287/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster-eda/notebook\n\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mtick\n\n#train_df[\"Family\"] = train_df[\"SibSp\"] + train_df[\"Parch\"]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,3.5))\ngs = fig.add_gridspec(1, 3)\ngs.update(wspace=0.4, hspace=0)\nax0 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 0])\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 1])\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, 2])\n\nbackground_color = \"#faf9f4\"\ncolor_palette = [\"#8d9e8c\", \"#eeb977\"]\nfig.patch.set_facecolor(background_color) # figure background color\nax0.set_facecolor(background_color) # axes background color\nax1.set_facecolor(background_color) # axes background color\nax2.set_facecolor(background_color) # axes background color\n\n# Factors\nax0.text(-1.8, 0.90, 'Factors', fontsize=20, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif', color=\"#323232\")\nax0.text(-1.8, 0.83, 'Preventing Secondary Transmission', \n         fontsize=14, fontweight='light', fontfamily='serif', color=\"#323232\")\nax0.text(-1.8, 0.66, 'Factors', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif', color=\"#323232\")\nax0.grid(color='gray', linestyle=':', axis='y', zorder=0,  dashes=(1,5))\nsns.barplot(ax=ax0, x=\"Factors\", y=\"Factors\", data=df, estimator=lambda x: len(x) / len(df[\"Factors\"]), color=\"#eeb977\", zorder=3)\nax0.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.PercentFormatter(1, decimals=0))\nax0.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax0.set_ylabel(\"\")\n\n# Excerpt\n#Family_count = train_df[\"Family\"].value_counts().sort_index()\n#Family_df = pd.DataFrame(train_df.groupby([\"Family\", \"Survived\"])[\"Family\"].count())\n#Family_df.columns = [\"Count\"]\n#Family_df = Family_df.reset_index(drop=False)\n#Family_df[\"Total_by_Family\"] = Family_df[\"Family\"].map(Family_count)\n#Family_df[\"Distribution_by_Family\"] = Family_df[\"Count\"] / Family_df[\"Total_by_Family\"]\nax1.text(-1.9, 1.1, 'Factors', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif', color=\"#323232\")\nax1.grid(color='gray', linestyle=':', axis='y', zorder=0,  dashes=(1,5))\nsns.barplot(ax=ax1, x=\"Date\", y=\"Factors\", data = df, hue=\"Study Type\", palette=color_palette, zorder=3)\nlegend_labels, _= ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax1.legend(legend_labels, [\"Factors\"], ncol=2, bbox_to_anchor=(-0.65, 1.3), facecolor=background_color, edgecolor=background_color)\nax1.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.PercentFormatter(1, decimals=0))\nax1.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax1.set_ylabel(\"\")\n\n# Entry\nax2.grid(color='gray', linestyle=':', axis='y', zorder=0,  dashes=(1,5))\nax2.text(-1.8, 0.46, 'Study Entries', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', fontfamily='serif', color=\"#323232\")\nsns.barplot(ax=ax2, x=\"Entry\", y=\"Entry\", hue=\"Study Type\", data=df, estimator=lambda x: len(x) / len(df[\"Entry\"]), palette=color_palette)\nax2.get_legend().remove()\nax2.yaxis.set_major_formatter(mtick.PercentFormatter(1, decimals=0))\nax2.yaxis.set_major_locator(mtick.MultipleLocator(0.1))\nax2.set_xlabel(\"\")\nax2.set_ylabel(\"\")\n\nfor s in [\"top\",\"right\",\"left\"]:\n    ax0.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n    ax1.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n    ax2.spines[s].set_visible(False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"That's what happens when you try a snippet from Titanic in another Dataset.

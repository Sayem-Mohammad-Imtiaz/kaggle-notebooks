Also, data can have some anomaly.\n\n**My Solution**\nI'll add `0` where `num_of_prev_attempts` are missing/null. Because in my opinion, it is okay to mark that student as `num_of_prev_attempts` zero.\n\n\n### final_result\n\nIf `final_result` is empty, it can have many meanings. For example, may be student final result is not updated yet. Or may be student left the school and that student record is being updated anymore. It really depends on the situation.\n\n**My Solution**\nIn this case, I'll not mark student as `pass`, `fail` etc. Because it can effect our results.

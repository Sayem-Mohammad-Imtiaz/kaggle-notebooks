The lyrics to \"Wade in the Water\" were first co-published in 1901 in New Jubilee Songs as Sung by the Fisk Jubilee Singers by Frederick J. Work and his brother, John Wesley Work Jr., an educator at the historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, Fisk University.\n\nWork Jr. (1871 – 1925)—who is also known as John Work II—spent thirty years collecting, promoting, and reviving the songcraft of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers, which included being a member and director of the Fisk Jubilee Quartet. The Sunset Four Jubilee Singers made the first commercial recording of \"Wade in the Water\" in 1925—released by Paramount Records. W. E. B. Du Bois, who called this genre of songs, the Sorrow Songs, reviewed the Sunset Four Jubilee Singers' performance of \"Wade in the Water\" in a 1925.\n\nINTERPRETATION OF THE LYRICS\n\nFisk University was founded by the American Missionary Association. Many of the songs in the original Fisk Jubilee Singers songbooks dealt with themes from both the Old and New Testament. According to a 2002 article written by Dave Watermulder, J. Amber Hudlin, and Ellie Kaufman at George Washington University, the song reflect the Israelites' escape out of Egypt as found in Exodus.\n\nAccording to a 2007 anthology by California State University in Fresno, the singer \"warns of the coming signs of the end\" but says the \"victory of Heaven over Hell\" is assured, and \"looks forward to future freedom.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_in_the_Water"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3MTU2MjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg5Mzk5Mw@@._V1_.jpg)imdb.com"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<iframe width=\"677\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QfmHWavDhZc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Wade in the Water  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfmHWavDhZc"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U spacy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"1.1\"></a>\n<h3 style=\"background-color:skyblue;font-family:newtimeroman;font-size:200%;text-align:center\">Wade in the water.\nWade in the water\nChildren.

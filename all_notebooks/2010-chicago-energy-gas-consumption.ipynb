However, the consumption of household size above 3 doesn't differ a lot.\n- For Multi < 7 subtype, it seems that the consumption profile is at the highest for household of size 2 - 3, and the profile starts to become stagnant or lower for household of size 4 and above.\n- In commercial subtype, it appears that the highest consumption profile is contributed by buildings with few occupants (2 or less). Significantly less energy consumption profile is observed on household size 2 and above.\n- In multi 7+ subtype, there is an increasing consumption profile with the increasing household size, at least until household size 4.\n- The consumption of municipal building and industrial unfortunately can not be profiled accurately than the previous subtype, due to lack of data on municipal buildings (only 20 entries, after missing values  are dropped and outliers are removed). However, there is some indication that household size of 2 have the highest consumption profile, but more data is needed.\n- The energy consumption profile of buildings in different community area seem to differ. This might have some correlation with the demography of the population there, however, further analysis involving other demographic dataset (e.g., population datasets) is needed to verify this assumption.\n- Buildings in Chicago are old. Based on the generated chart, it's inconclusive to see which area have the oldest buildings, since the data has a very wide standard deviation\n- The electricity consumption during summer is higher, perhaps due to summer and people are staying more at home during this time (holiday).

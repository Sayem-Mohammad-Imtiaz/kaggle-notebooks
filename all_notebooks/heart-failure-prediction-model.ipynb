Most of the information is related to the pre-processing pipeline which is constructed when setup() is executed. The majority of these features are out of scope for the purposes of this tutorial however a few important things to note at this stage include:\n\n**session_id :** A pseduo-random number distributed as a seed in all functions for later reproducibility. If no session_id is passed, a random number is automatically generated that is distributed to all functions. In this experiment, the session_id is set as 123 for later reproducibility.\n\n**Target Type :** Binary or Multiclass. The Target type is automatically detected and shown. There is no difference in how the experiment is performed for Binary or Multiclass problems. All functionalities are identical.\n\n**Label Encoded :** When the Target variable is of type string (i.e. 'Yes' or 'No') instead of 1 or 0, it automatically encodes the label into 1 and 0 and displays the mapping (0 : No, 1 : Yes) for reference. In this experiment no label encoding is required since the target variable is of type numeric.\n\n**Original Data :** Displays the original shape of the dataset. In this experiment (22800, 24) means 22,800 samples and 24 features including the target column.\n\n**Missing Values :** When there are missing values in the original data this will show as True. For this experiment there are no missing values in the dataset.\n\n**Numeric Features :** The number of features inferred as numeric. In this dataset, 14 out of 24 features are inferred as numeric.\n\n**Categorical Features :** The number of features inferred as categorical. In this dataset, 9 out of 24 features are inferred as categorical.\n\n**Transformed Train Set :** Displays the shape of the transformed training set. Notice that the original shape of (22800, 24) is transformed into (15959, 91) for the transformed train set and the number of features have increased to 91 from 24 due to categorical encoding\n\n**Transformed Test Set :** Displays the shape of the transformed test/hold-out set. There are 6841 samples in test/hold-out set. This split is based on the default value of 70/30 that can be changed using the train_size parameter in setup.\nNotice how a few tasks that are imperative to perform modeling are automatically handled such as missing value imputation (in this case there are no missing values in the training data, but we still need imputers for unseen data), categorical encoding etc. Most of the parameters in setup() are optional and used for customizing the pre-processing pipeline. These parameters are out of scope for this tutorial but as you progress to the intermediate and expert levels, we will cover them in much greater detail.\n\n*Source: PyCaret Tutorial*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Comparing Model**\n\nComparing all models to evaluate performance is the recommended starting point for modeling once the setup is completed (unless you exactly know what kind of model you need, which is often not the case).

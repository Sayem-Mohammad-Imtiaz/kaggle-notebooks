We used a single \"sample\" of houses for both building the model and evaluating it. Here's why this is bad.\n\n## EXAMP LE OF A DATA SET\nImagine that, in the large real estate market, door color is unrelated to home price.\n\nHowever, in the sample of data you used to build the model, all homes with green doors were very expensive. The model's job is to find patterns that predict home prices, so it will see this pattern, and it will always predict high prices for homes with green doors.\n\nSince this pattern was derived from the training data, the model will appear accurate in the training data.\n\nBut if this pattern doesn't hold when the model sees new data, the model would be very inaccurate when used in practice.\n\nSince models' practical value come from making predictions on new data, we measure performance on data that wasn't used to build the model. The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. \n### This data is called validation data.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The scikit-learn library has a function train_test_split to break up the data into two pieces.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Random Forests Regression\n\nYou'll see more about what this algorithm actually is in Part III (of course, if you're reading this after Part III, you already know).  Look up the code for how to use Random Forests Regression in Python (the package necessary is already imported in the second cell, so you can just look that up).  You have to create the model, train it on `train_X` and `train_Y`, and then find and print the mean absolute error using the imported function, the model's predicted values on `val_X`, and `val_y`.\n\nOf course, much like in the real world, if you can find the exact code you need online without having to write it yourself, I wouldn't blame you for doing so - I might actually recommend it, although being familiar with the code has its own benefits.  So if you can find the rest of this code online, use it.

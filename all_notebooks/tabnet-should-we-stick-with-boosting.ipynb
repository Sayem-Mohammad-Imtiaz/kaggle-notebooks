{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Speak to any Kaggle Competitor: Histogram Gradient Boosting is 'the model' for tabular data. The fact that Histogram Gradient Boosting is so fast, so robust and so dependible is actually astonishing and difficult to ignore. The fact that these approaches are also so explainable makes them a 'must have' in feature engineering and has even gotten [bankers excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLxR5fqVQm0&list=WL&index=11&t=1738s). What makes these methods so good is just how robust they are to garbage: data which is irrelevant, multicollinear, unscaled and of mixed type, as well as how portable they have become across languages and applictions. There is good [theory why these methods work so well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPqtzj5VZus&list=WL&index=8&t=2164s), related to VC theory and the orthogonality of the predictions of the individual trees. \n  \nHowever, there are still opppotunities and area where trees struggle:\n1. trees can have poor performance in multi-output problems, as you need to fit a model for each individual class and cannot benefit from shared representations\n2. trees cannot compute gradients over state-of-the-art image recognition backbones to incorperate image, pretrained embeddings or audio data, and \n3. trees cannot be used with self-supervised pretraining in cases where you may have few labels\nThat's what [TabNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf.) promises: robustness and explainability on tabular data without losing out on the tricks and advantages which Deep Learning approaches can offer in certain contexts. \n  \n![tabnet](https://github.com/titu1994/tf-TabNet/raw/master/images/TabNet.png?raw=true)\nThe magic behind TabNets comparible robustness and explainability relies on its use of transformers. Transformers have become an increasingly popular and powerful architecture in Natural Language and even Image data, and now are finding use in Tabular Data as well. [Transformers are attention mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDulhoQ2pro) which serve to mask certain features at different stages of the model. By masking these features, TabNet is able to indicate what features are most used globally, similar to how tree ensembles describe global feature importance, and local importance or attribution as well. Tabnet also draws on a number of other tricks from object detection problems by using [residual connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWt6Fu05voI), along with [batch normalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUUqwaxLnWs).  I've tagged great resources here as these concepts need a lot of time on their own and are outside the scope of this notebook. \n  \nTabNet has two useful implemnetations in [Pytorch](https://github.com/dreamquark-ai/tabnet) and, by the original authors, in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tabnet).  In this notebook we will look at the Pytorch implementation which has more community support and benchmarking, and compare our results under default parameters to a Feed-forward Dense Neural Network provided in Scikit-learn, and CatBoost. We will compare the global feature importances described by TabNet and our Catboost and let readers get a sense of the usability and promise of these tools.

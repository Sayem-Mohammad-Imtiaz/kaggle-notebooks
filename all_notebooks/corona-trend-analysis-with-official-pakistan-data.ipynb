This dataset is tracking those efforts and their impact towards Corona virus prevention.\n\nRelated Information about COVID-19\nCOVID-19 may not be fatal but it spreads faster than other diseases, like common cold. Every virus has Basic Reproduction number (R0) which implies how many people will get the disease from the infected person. As per inital reseach work R0 of COVID-19 is 2.7.\n\nCurrently the goal of all scientists around the world is to \"Flatten the Curve\". COVID-19 currently has exponential growth rate around the world which we will be seeing in the notebook ahead. Flattening the Curve typically implies even if the number of Confirmed Cases are increasing but the distribution of those cases should be over longer timestamp. To put it in simple words if say suppose COVID-19 is going infect 100K people then those many people should be infected in 1 year but not in a month.\n\nThe sole reason to Flatten the Curve is to reudce the load on the Medical Systems so as to increase the focus of Research to find the Medicine for the disease.\n\nEvery Pandemic has four stages:\n\nStage 1: Confirmed Cases come from other countries\n\nStage 2: Local Transmission Begins\n\nStage 3: Communities impacted with local transimission\n\nStage 4: Significant Transmission with no end in sight\n\nItaly and Korea are the two countries which are currently in Stage 4 While India is in Stage 2.\n\nOther ways to tackle the disease like Corona other than Travel Ban, Cross-Border shutdown, isolation, closure of some high risk market places, Contact Tracing and Quarantine.\n\n### Reference\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/neelkudu28/covid-19-visualizations-predictions-forecasting"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## NIH Preparedness and Response\n\n- Contact tracing of confirmed cases being carried out by the RRTs.\n- Risk communication carried out among healthcare workers and affected communities during contact tracing.\n- NIH laboratory is providing support to provinces and regions for testing."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Provinces Preparedness and Response\n### 17th March 2020\n### Balochistan\n- 5 PCR equipment made available.\n- Sampling of all quarantined persons at PCSIR village Quetta will be completed today.\n### Sindh\n- 300 pilgrims have been shifted from Taftan to Sukkhur Quarantine Centre.\n- Arrangements being made for pilgrims to be shifted from Taftan to Sindh.\n### Punjab\n- PDSRU is in 24/7 coordination with NIH, Islamabad.\n### KP & TD\n- 15 confirmed cases quarantined at isolated facility in DI Khan.\n### AJK\n- District RRTs have done screening of 02 workers from USA, 24 from UK, 10 from UAE, 21 from Saudi Arabia, 01 from Oman, France and Bahrain each so far.\n### GB\n- Total 1000 PPE kits, 17 thermo-guns and 781 VTM, PCR Kits with testing capacity of 350 samples made available."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#!pip install urllib2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/corona-cases-in-pakistan/Corona Pakistan.csv',index_col='SNo')\ndf.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[\"Reporting Date\"] =  pd.to_datetime(df['Reporting Date'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.sort_values(\"Reporting Date\", axis = 0, ascending = True, \n                 inplace = True, na_position ='last') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Risk from Travellers Coming from Abroad\n\nTravellers coming Iran are proving to be our worst nightmare.

We need to increase testing bandwidth and make it easily available across the country to make sure that we do not miss out on potential outbreak.\n3).

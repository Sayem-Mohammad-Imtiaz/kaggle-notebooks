The data is split into nodes based on\nfeature values. This model is good for occasions when there is no single linear line that\ncan divide the data. Gini Impurity of a node represents the probability that a randomly chosen\nsample would be incorrectly classified, so the goal is to reduce this as much as possible.\n\nUsing a single decision tree could cause overfitting of the training data. For example,\na decision tree could create a leaf node (the predicted class) for each instance.\nUsing a forest could help generalize better to new data. The random forest model\nsamples random points and subsets of features when training.

Therefore, it must be taken into account how the quantity of declarations may also have changed/increased over time due to improved technology, alterations in reporting standards, increased populations and more. \n    \n  \nResearch Questions: \n1. Have the types of storms which occur each year changed since 1965? \n2. Has the average length of storms which occur each year changed since 1965?\n3. Has the type and duration of winter weather events changed since 1965? \n\n    \nWhy is this important? \nUnderstanding the way in which the types of weather events are changing, and more specifically, shifts in intensity or occurrence of particular storms, allows us to prepare, adapt and ensure resilience during times of change and uncertainty. This becomes especially prudent for instance, when addressing rising temperatures and sea levels, or increasingly intense weather events.

With the number of hurricanes incresaing, it is likely that 'storm', while being ambiguous, could illustrate Tropical Storms, and also be a sign of a rising intensity of weather events, that previously, had a weaker impact on counties and were therefore not declared as emergencies. \n\nBeginning in 1999 the number of fire related emergencies increases while the number of floods decreases. In turn, it would be interesting to contrast this analysis with data on rising temperatures and rainfall changes.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Have have the type of winter storms changed since 1965?\ndf_winter = df_time[(df_time['Disaster_Type'] == 'Winter') | (df_time['Disaster_Type'] == 'Snow') | (df_time['Disaster_Type'] == 'Ice')]\n\ndf_winter.drop(columns=['Start_Date_A', 'End_Date_A'], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\ndf_winter.drop_duplicates(keep='first')\n\n#How many of each type of winter storm happened each year? \ndf_winter_tcount= df_winter.groupby(['Start_year', 'Disaster_Type']).size()\n\ndf_winter_tcount=pd.DataFrame(df_winter_tcount)\n\ndf_winter_tcount = df_winter_tcount.reset_index()\n\ndf_winter_tcount.columns=['Start_Year','Disaster_Type','Event_Count']\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,12))\n\ndf_winter_tcount.pivot(index='Start_Year', columns = 'Disaster_Type', values='Event_Count').plot.bar(stacked=True, ax=ax, zorder=3)\nax.legend(ncol=3, edgecolor='w')\n[ax.spines[s].set_visible(False) for s in ['top','right', 'left']]\nax.tick_params(axis='both', left=False, bottom=False)\nplt.title('Type of Winter Storms Occurring each Year (1965-2017)', size=25, pad=2)\nplt.xlabel(xlabel='')\nax.grid(axis='y', dashes=(8,3), color='grey', alpha=0.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-26T13:55:00.302371Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-26T13:55:00.302608Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.264643Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-26T13:55:00.302585Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.263847Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_winter_length = df_winter.drop(columns=['County','Disaster_Type'])\n\n\ndf_winter_length = df_winter_length.groupby(['Start_year']).mean()\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16,12))\ndf_winter_length.plot.bar(ax=ax, zorder=3)\n\nax.legend(ncol=3, edgecolor='w')\n[ax.spines[s].set_visible(False) for s in ['top','right', 'left']]\nax.tick_params(axis='both', left=False, bottom=False)\nplt.title('Average Length of Winter Storms 1965-2017 (Days)', size=25)\nax.grid(axis='y', dashes=(8,3), color='grey', alpha=0.3)\nplt.xlabel(xlabel='')\nfig.savefig('Change_in_Average Length_of_Winter_Events')\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.266431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.266666Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.978162Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.266642Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-26T13:55:01.977085Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When looking specifically at Winter storms, it appears that the types of storms has shifted, with more ice related emergencies being declared.

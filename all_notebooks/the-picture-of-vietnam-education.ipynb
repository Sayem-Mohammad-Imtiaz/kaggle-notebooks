In other words, it shapes the nation's future. \n\nAs a country shifted from a centrally planned to a market economy, Vietnam has transformed from one of the poorest in the world into a lower middle-income country. Along with economic development strategies, Vietnam has intensively invested in education. In this analysis, I will break down the nationally educational large scales aspects, which have been changed rapidly altogether with the economy since the political reformed under Doi Moi, launched in 1986. \n\nThis analysis is also helpful for investors which interest in investing in the education sector in Vietnam, to have an overview of the development of the country's education.

I have personally collected and manipulated data from:\n- World Bank data\n- General Statistics office of Vietnam: https://www.gso.gov.vn\n- Ministry of Education: https://moet.gov.vn/Pages/home.aspx\n- OEDC data: https://data.oecd.org\n\nThey are represented in 4 tables: pop - Population of Vietnam over years, 'edu' - The number of Vietnamese students in each level over years, 'gdp' - GDP of Vietnam and some other countries in South East Asia over years, and PISA - The average reading, mathematics and science score in 2018. \n\nNote:\n- edu: From 2015, the number of higher education students does not include students in college.\n- Viet Nam participated in PISA 2018 using paper-based instruments. By the time the OEDC report of PISA 2018 was published, the international comparability of Viet Nam’s performance in reading, mathematics and science could not be fully ensured. For this reason, the OECD does not report comparisons of Viet Nam’s performance in PISA with other countries. The data of Vietnam's PISA score uses here is collected from the Ministry of Education. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#loading dataset\n#population dataset\npop = pd.read_csv('../input/vietnam-population-dgp-education-data/pop.csv')\n\n#Education Dataset\nedu = pd.read_csv('../input/vietnam-population-dgp-education-data/Vietnamstudent.csv')\n                  \n#DGP comparing dataset\ngdp = pd.read_csv('../input/vietnam-population-dgp-education-data/GDPcompare.csv')\n#Average pisa score 2018\npisa = pd.read_csv('../input/vietnam-population-dgp-education-data/Pisa_GDP.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.

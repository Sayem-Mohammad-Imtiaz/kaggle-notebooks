This is my first upload here to Kaggle. I decided to upload this only after I've made it, so apologies if it is not 100% readable for anyone. Next one will be better :-D. Open to any feedback, comments or suggestions! \n\n![image of Titanic](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/titanic/images/6/6e/100_anniversary_titanic_sinking_by_esai8mellows-d4xbme8.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20171123230214)\n\nThe process wil consist of data asking the right questions, data wrangling, exploring and communicating. \n\n## Questions\nThe data contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. The data includes: \n- Survival \n- Ticket class\n- Sex\n- Age in years\n- Number of siblings / spouses aboard Titanic\n- Number parents / children aboard Titanic \n- Ticket number \n- Passenger fare\n- Cabin number \n- Port of embarkation\n\nIn the end, it seems interesting to see the relation between several aspects and survival. However, first some more general questions: \n- How many of these 891 passengers are first, second, third class or crew? \n- How many survived of these? How does this relate to the overal ratio of about 64% of people on board who perished? \n- What is the ratio between men and women on board? How does this vary per class? \n- What percentage of passengers was travelling without family? \n- What percentage of passengers embarked at one of the 3 ports (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)\n\nThen, when we have this general sense of all the data, we can start relating things to survival rate. Let's look at survivalrates for: \n- Men vs. women \n- Classes or crew\n- Baby's, children, adults \n- People travelling alone versus people travelling with family \n\nFinally, it would be interesting to see the relation between survival and ticket fare. \n\nAnyway... let's start there. Seems like a good point!!\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52118c41fe915c7ac404603d5975a0caa596bea5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data wrangling\nBefore we do anything, we need to load our data, check and correct anomalies, and format it in a clear an concise manner."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1b619d507ee8c6f96637b98975fc89e87f137807"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Right, first some modules \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport math\n\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\nsns.set_palette('Blues')\n\n# Some magic\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Now let's load some data \nrawdata_df = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic_data.csv')","execution_count":79,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f6a6543d101f37de55e55c7fe9177684bc64817c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rawdata_df.head()","execution_count":80,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"90b82c1e733fa4394fc2268006d4ff111d61037b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rawdata_df.tail()","execution_count":81,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"adaf7999efa0144df61ff09e9cd70d82e2abf9d2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rawdata_df.describe()","execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"806755723166e85ee330347779f603afa11e0b7a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I notice a couple of things.

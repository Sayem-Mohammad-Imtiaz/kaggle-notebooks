Because there were only 45 out of 1.3M records, we called them Unicorns.  To define a Unicorn, we filtered the worst performance of the day for each trading day, and then qualified those worst performers by a ratio of the dip compared to the month's volatility.  We followed up identifying the Unicorns by graphing each of their performances over about two months.  Finally, we used some stats graphing to show how the distribution of Unicorns differs from all stocks.  It can be seen that while some Unicorns perform under market value, most of them have a positive ROI and a special few outliers help drive up the multiplier. \n\nIf you stumble upon this data set and want to carry it forward, choose a different buying pattern for the same stocks, expand the threshold for the volatility (to get more stocks), filter the worst five or ten performers of the day (to get more stocks), look for a different historical event (here I chose the worst performer of the day, but you might try the highest performer of the day, or those with four declining days in a row).  Make sure that you assess your subset's performance and compare it to typical market performance.  \n\nDisclosure:  I'm not advocating that you buy any particular stock, or providing assurance as to the performance of any particular stock.

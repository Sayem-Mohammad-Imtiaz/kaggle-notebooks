with our second classification report that our precision for predicting benign cases has dropped to 0.99 from 1.0 in the 1st model while our precision value for predicting malignant cases has dropped from 0.92 to 0.9. The recall value in the subtest has also dropped for banign cases going from 0.96 to 0.95, and from 1.0 to 0.98 for malignant cases. The f1-score for this run of the subtest also indicated a drop from 0.98 to 0.97 for banign cases and a drop from 0.96 to 0.94 in malignant cases. With the results gained from both runs of the two tests we saw a slightly negative trend caused within our subtest that shows weaker precision recall and f1-score, however the overall difference in our f1-score in our run is not large enough to make a 100% confident statement on which model is better. \n\nNote: The results vary with each run and upon 2nd run through we see a positive change in preciosion values within our subtest (only slightly), and identical f1-scores to the original test, indicating that there is not a large enough difference in values to give a clear indication as to which approach is better.*"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a4b6d34d7ed21f0f60514ecaca10aa33a0557d1c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = data.iloc[:, 1:10] #set x to all columns except ID and Class\ny = data.iloc[:, -1] #set y to the Class column\n\n#train_split_test the x and y values with a test size of 20%\nx_train, x_test, y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2)\n\n#print to see if the results are approximately what they should be\nprint(x_train.shape, y_train.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6b174f3862330bc28bf955197ff6e6eb01583304"},"cell_type":"code","source":" \n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nneigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 1)\nneigh.fit(x_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7e82c40e33709bfc7f9c2d35a95256b28f248f40"},"cell_type":"code","source":"predn = neigh.predict(x_test)\n\n#both the prints should show same numbers in same order\nprint(predn[:10])\nprint(y_test[:10])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"85a86fe30101d0c7ddd0add637213182796d47ff"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(confusion_matrix(y_test,predn))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7dd1b97d5c7f9bfdee26c7cb2243397671dcfa72"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test, predn))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cbf0524146aa7268fb204bfb76190763f0100d70"},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = data.iloc[:, 1:10] #set x to all columns except ID and Class\ny = data.iloc[:, -1] #set y to the Class column\n\n#train_split_test the x and y values with a test size of 20%\nx_train, x_test, y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.2)\n\n#print to see if the results are approximately what they should be\nprint(x_train.shape, y_train.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8410f5a9d23088c80705506621ab3d659306a113"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nneigh2 = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5)\nneigh2.fit(x_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3e501974e67350a68cc86b4ce13856065d7a2185"},"cell_type":"code","source":"predn2 = neigh2.predict(x_test)\n\n#both the prints should show same numbers in same order\nprint(predn2[:10])\nprint(y_test[:10])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a84d77a84378a385dbefdda0f49235dcc7f75c7b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(confusion_matrix(y_test,predn2))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5e423b556cf5679de15812a26d83885082e8d747"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test, predn2))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"b0bf05ab21f659ba26c2ebf95d487f16fccd631e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*After a full run through with all 4 methods (SVC train and subtrain, Knn classifier 1 and knn classifier 5) the f-1 scores for predicting the values seem to be highest using the SVC subtrain, however the difference in values is not largely different to the scores presented by the other 3 tests used and thus are not substantial enough to say which method is in fact more effective.*"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

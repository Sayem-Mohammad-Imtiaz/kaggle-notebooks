The meaning of the name is “pure”; however, it has been rapidly declining in popularity over the past couple of years as it becomes more associated with white privilege. The exact origins of this association is unknown, but according to Robin Queen, the chairwoman of the linguistics department at University of Michigan, the first mention of Karen being used negatively was in Dane Cook’s 2005 comedy album (Goldblatt, 2020). As an example of “a friend nobody likes”, Cook describes a woman named Karen. This meme is then speculated to have been used on Reddit somewhere between 2014 and 2015, from where it truly exploded in popularity in 2018, where “Karen” was used “to reference a hair style, white women who ask to speak to the manager, and people being racist in public (Greenspan, 2020). In this notebook, we explore the prevalence of the name Karen from its height in the 1960s to its 21st century fall.\n\nGoldblatt, H. (2020).

By too recent, I mean that although the deaths may be increasing, the increase is so recent that it would not be fair to make an assumption based on a recent divergence which is only minor in comparison to the change seen in other states.\n\nIf you scroll the 'Year' bar to the most recent date of 2016, it is possible to see that these states seem to have a noticable divergence in the number of deaths in relation to their population. As population seems to have grown dramatically in the past decade (globally), here is evidence that drug-induced death rates are beginning to climb increasingly higher, perhaps reaching a statistical limit in some areas.\n\nFor instance will the deaths peak in Ohio or Pennsylvania? Will something else happen to change the direction of growth towards a more sensible increase? Perhaps the legalization of Marijuana in California as a recreational substance will either send the drug-induced death rate over the population growth line, or help to alleviate it (the debate has arguments from both sides)?","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://public.tableau.com/profile/jared.yu#!/vizhome/DrugDeathRateAnalytics/Divergence?publish=yes', width=900, height=550)","outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{}},{"source":"My conclusion is that in recent years, population growth has increased dramatically across the country. With this welcoming increase in number of citizens are the problems that come with such a growth.

Rather I am indicating that there is a significant change happening to our population, and if the country is not mindful of the difference between now and before then trouble is inevitable.\n\nThe goal for the analytics performed here has not been to develop a highly elaborate or descriptive explanation for any incredibly obvious piece of data. Rather it was to produce simple, clear, and easy to understand descriptions for any interesting insights uncoverable from the data that was readily available.\n\nI would like to thank user 'Himanshu Chaudhary' for having examples of Tableau, and allowing for me to be able to share my own insights into data utilizing this valuable new software from within the data analytics industry.","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}}}

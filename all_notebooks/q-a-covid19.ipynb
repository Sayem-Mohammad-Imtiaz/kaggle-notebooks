In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. \n\n### Brief History\n\nCoronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40â€“90%. Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease. In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.\n\n### Symptoms\n\nCOVID-19 health information:\n\n* Symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath.\n* Complications: pneumonia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure.\n* Risk Factors: age, serious underlying medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc).\n\n*Sources:- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus)*\n\n*Image source:- [Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583324113626-70df0f4deaab?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&w=1000&q=80)*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*I came up with a list of questions which struck my mind and I was curious about them for a long time, of course there is no better way to get answers for your questions than using EDA if you have data about the problem.*\n\nI will be adding a lot more questions as time passes by and will make sure to get some good conclusions from the EDA.

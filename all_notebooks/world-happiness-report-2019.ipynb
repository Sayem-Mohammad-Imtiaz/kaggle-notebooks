Following are the observations that can be made from the correlation heatmap above -\n\n1. Just to familiarize you with how this works, the most obvious strong negative correlation you can observe at first glance is between overall rank and the happiness score which is -0.99. This means that greater the value of the happiness score, lower the value of the overall rank and vice versa. In case you find this a bit confounding, remember that if the value of the overall rank is low, it simply means that the country is higher up in the ranking, thus it has a higher happiness score.\n\n2. There is a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita X Score, Social Support X Score and Healthy Life Expectancy X Score. This means that higher the contribution of these factors to the happiness score, greater is the happiness score. Also, the Happiness Score is heavily influenced by these factors.\n\n3. You may also have observed that the value of correlation between Score and Generosity is 0.076, which would be considered insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that Generosity as a contributing factor does not have much of an influence on the Happiness Score.\n\n4. Another interesting observation that can be made is the strong positive correlation between GDP Per Capita X Social Support, GDP Per Capita X Healthy Life Expectancy, and Social Support X Healthy Life Expectancy. In my opinion, this should mean that if the value of one of these features as contributing factors is high then it is extremely likely that the value of the other two features as contributing factors must also be high. \n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

This activity uses the data from the Edexcel large data set and related data from the Met office website to explore how much the temperature has changed and whether this change is similar for different parts of the UK. The activity demonstrates working through at least two iterations of a data science cycle.\n\nIn activity 1a for this lesson you explored whether 2015 was a hotter year than 1987 for weather stations in the large data set.

To make it successful, we have to segment them in at-least 3 distinct groups known as \"marketing segmentation\". It will help to maximize the marketing campaign conversion rate. For example the general four segments are:\n1. Transactors: Customers who pay least amount of interest and very careful with the money. Generally they have lower balance(USD 104), cash advance (USD 303) and perecnt of full paymenet = 23% \n2. Revolvers : (Most lucrative sector) use credit card as a loan, generally they have highest balance (USD 5000), cash advance (USD 5000), low purchase frequency, high cash advance frequency (0.5), high cash advance transactions (16).\n3. VIP/Prime : (This group is specific target to increase credit limit and spend habbit) High credit limit (USD 16K), high percentage of full payment.\n4.

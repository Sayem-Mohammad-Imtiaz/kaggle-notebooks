They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the Marketing team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the back poorly. Based on this, the Operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customers queries are resolved faster. Head of Marketing and Head of Delivery both decide to reach out to the Data Science team for help.\n\n\n----------------------------\n## Objective: \n-----------------------------\n\nIdentify different segments in the existing customer based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank.\n\n--------------------------\n## About the data:\n--------------------------\nData is of various customers of a bank with their credit limit, the total number of credit cards the customer has, and different channels through which customer has contacted the bank for any queries, different channels include visiting the bank, online and through a call centre.\n\n- Sl_no - Customer Serial Number\n- Customer Key - Customer identification\n- Avg_Credit_Limit\t- Average credit limit (currency is not specified, you can make an assumption around this)\n- Total_Credit_Cards\t- Total number of credit cards \n- Total_visits_bank\t- Total bank visits\n- Total_visits_online -\t Total online visits\n- Total_calls_made - Total calls made","metadata":{"id":"tIOusyeT4_RJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing libraries and overview of the dataset","metadata":{"id":"0ReVFSgtvvO6"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import all the necessary packages\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#to scale the data using z-score \nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n#importing clustering algorithms\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\n\n\n#installing and importing the sklearn_extra library\n!pip install scikit-learn-extra\nfrom sklearn_extra.cluster import KMedoids\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"id":"KJKn2dkPKnkU","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T13:28:18.736629Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T13:28:18.737052Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.182328Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T13:28:18.736993Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.181355Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Loading data","metadata":{"id":"9qEgcn2XvvO8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/credit-card-customer-data/Credit Card Customer Data.csv')\ndata.head()","metadata":{"id":"p4QVUUO3VHHH","outputId":"6bd7504e-4281-41ca-f508-5a61927e94b1","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.188185Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.188428Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.224048Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.188401Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.222979Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Check the info of the data","metadata":{"id":"ZmxlhPKovvO-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"id":"dtroAFl9vvO-","outputId":"bff20f83-1d85-488e-e1dc-e73c56f563a6","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.225903Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.226308Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.245403Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.226268Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.244353Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Observations:**\n\n- There are 660 observations and 7 columns in the dataset.\n- All columns have 660 non-null values i.e. there are no missing values.\n- All columns are of int64 data type.\n- There are no missing values.","metadata":{"id":"EPP73jY5vvPA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Let us now figure out the uniques in each column** ","metadata":{"id":"DOP-MnWovvPA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.nunique()","metadata":{"id":"OCRC8zfDvvPB","outputId":"ad647d25-ef4e-48fa-9f7e-6f1916668f0e","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.246729Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.247028Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.260827Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.246999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T13:28:26.259836Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Customer key, which is an identifier, has repeated values.

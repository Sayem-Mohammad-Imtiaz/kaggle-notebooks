It was backed by data and predictions on the percentage of vaccinations the country needs to be at. They state once the number of first time vaccinations reach 60%, we can expect positive change.

If I could do it again I would navigate using different graphs and machine learning tools. This was a good excerise to comb through datasets and provide visualizations.\n\nThe hardest part was plotting the GDP on a graph. Since it doesn't change (almost at all), the X axis was just a long line. I needed to do a bit more research on which graph would have visualized this better. I also had throuble building horizontal bar charts and feel adding one could have visualized the number of cases, number of deaths, and number of vaccines per country.","metadata":{}}]}

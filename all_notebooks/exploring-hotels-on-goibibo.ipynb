Like many other hotel-booking sites -- in the United States, `hotels.com` comes to mind -- it allows users an easy option for comparing hotel prices and going through with booking in one interface.\n\nIn this notebook we will explore this dataset, a detailed sample of the hotels listed on Goibibo. We will probe the basic dataset attributes and hopefully uncover some interesting effects from the data! This exploratory data analytics notebook is recommended for beginners and those interested in probing this dataset further.

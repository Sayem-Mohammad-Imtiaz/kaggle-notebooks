NIFTY 50 stands for National Index Fifty, and represents the weighted average of 50 Indian company stocks in 17 sectors.

Volatility is often described as the “rate and magnitude of changes in prices\" and in finance often referred to as risk. Volatility Index is a measure, of the amount by which an underlying Index is expected to fluctuate, in the near term,\n\n## NIFTY 50, NIFTY 100 and NIFTY 500 \n  * NIFTY 500 - It represents the top 500 companies based on full market capitalisation from the eligible universe\n  * NIFTY 100 - This represents the top 100 companies (i.e. from 1 to 100) from within the NIFTY 500. This index basically tries to track the performance of companies having large market caps.\n  * NIFTY 50 - This represents the first 50 companies from the NIFTY 100.\n\n## NIFTY SMALL CAP & MID CAP\n* NIFTY SMALLCAP - This index measures the performance of small-cap companies.\n* NIFTY MIDCAP - This index tries to measure the performance of mid-cap companies.\n\n## NIFTY NEXT 50\nThis includes the remaining 50 companies from NIFTY 100 after excluding the NIFTY 50 companies. These are also called as NIFTY Junior.\n\n## NIFTY SECTORAL INDICES\nThis includes NIFTY AUTO,NIFTY BANK, NIFTY FMCG, NIFTY IT,NIFTY METAL, NIFTY PHARMA\nThese Indices are designed to reflect the behavior and performance of the segment that they reflect i.e automobiles, bank, pharma etc.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nifty_50 = pd.read_csv('../input/nifty-indices-dataset/NIFTY 50.csv',parse_dates=[\"Date\"], index_col=\"Date\")\nnifty_50.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the Stock Data\n\nNow that our data has been converted into the desired format, let’s take a look at its various columns for further analysis.\n\n* **The Open and Close columns** indicate the opening and closing price of the stocks on a particular day.\n* **The High and Low columns** provide the highest and the lowest price for the stock on a particular day, respectively.\n* **The Volume column** tells us the total volume of stocks traded on a particular day.\n* **The Turnover column** refers to the total value of stocks traded during a specific period of time.

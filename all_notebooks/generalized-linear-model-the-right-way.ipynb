The coefficients can be interpreted as the log odds, which can be translated to a number in probability by the formula\n\n$$P = \\cfrac{\\text{odds}}{1 + \\text{odss}}$$\n\n\n## Question 1 Is there a statistical siginificant dependence between `gender` & `heart attack risk`?\n\n```\t\n                  coef      std err     z         P>|z|   [0.025 0.975]\nC(sex)[T.1]      -1.8623    0.571      -3.262    0.001   -2.981 -0.743\n```\n\nHow to interpret this result? The column `coef` has a value of `-1.8623`, meaning a log odd of `-1.8623` for having a high risk, if you are male. Translated to a probability of $2.16 \\%$, i.e, men has $2.16 \\%$ higher probability of getting heart attack than women in this dataset. The standard error for the log odd is `std err = 0.571`.\n\nThe test statistic for this coefficient can be found in column `z = -3.262`, yielding a siginificant p value of `P > |z| = 0.001`\n\nThe $0.95$ confidence interval of this log odd is $[-2.981, -0.743]$, or $[1.5 \\%, -2.8 \\%]$. \n\n\n## Question 2 Is there a dependence between `age` and `heart attack risk`? \n\n```\n                  coef      std err     z         P>|z|   [0.025 0.975]\nage               0.0278    0.025       1.094     0.274   -0.022 0.078\n```\n\nThe log odd in this case is $0.0278$ with a P value of $0.274$, which is not lower than the standard $0.05$, therefore we can not reject the null hypothesis that the log odd can be as well $0$.","metadata":{}}]}

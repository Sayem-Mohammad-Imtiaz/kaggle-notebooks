She turned to chess, a game her father taught her at age 9. Menchik could not speak English, so she threw herself into chess, joining a local club and taking private lessons. The game suited her inability to communicate. In her letter to Chess Magazine, she wrote:\n\n\"I have often been asked, what made me think seriously about chess? It would appear that the atmosphere of silence and heavy smoking is not appropriate for a young lady. That’s true! In other life circumstances it would not occur to me to spend time in such a way, but chess is a quiet game and therefore the best hobby for a person who cannot speak the language properly.\"\n\nShe immediately excelled, first in local matches, then regionally, then nationally, then internationally. When the first Women’s World Chess Championship was held in 1927, Menchik won. When she kept winning women’s matches, often very easily, she set her sights on men, becoming the first woman to play in male tournaments.\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/11/28/vera-menchik-chess-queens-gambit-beth-harmon/"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code from Gabriel Preda\n#plt.style.use('dark_background')\ndef plot_count(feature, title, df, size=1):\n    f, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(4*size,4))\n    total = float(len(df))\n    g = sns.countplot(df[feature], order = df[feature].value_counts().index[:20], palette= ('summer'))\n    g.set_title(\"Number and percentage of {}\".format(title))\n    if(size > 2):\n        plt.xticks(rotation=90, size=8)\n    for p in ax.patches:\n        height = p.get_height()\n        ax.text(p.get_x()+p.get_width()/2.,\n                height + 3,\n                '{:1.2f}%'.format(100*height/total),\n                ha=\"center\") \n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#How Georgia Nona Gaprindashvili conquered the chess world\n\nBy Fatima Hudoon, 27 November 2020\n\nMeet the world’s first female Grandmaster, who popularised the game in Georgia, has a chess palace named after her, and is still competing today.\n\nGaprindashvili is a real chess player from Georgia who became the Women’s World Chess Champion five times.

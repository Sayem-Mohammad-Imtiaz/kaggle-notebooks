Disease data, such as information on suspicions and confirmation of outbreaks in livestock and wildlife species, laboratory results or follow-up reports on an outbreak situation, can be stored in a standardized format and are presented through a user-friendly and customizable interface. \n\nThe dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/tentotheminus9/empres-global-animal-disease-surveillance\n\n## Content\nThe dataset shows the when, where and what of animal disease outbreaks from 2016 to 2017, including African swine fever, Foot and mouth disease and Bird-flu.

Hence, it is so common to find this application by many companies.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2. Recommender Systems Mechanism** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In this section, we will focus on recommender systems mechanism, i.e. how a recommender systems work.\n\n- Basically, a recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users.\n\n- It first studies the past behaviour of a customer and based on that recommends products which he might buy.\n\n- The working of recommender systems is shown in the following diagram-","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Recommender Systems Mechanism](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*yYFoZKYpp7MT_iAqoE1lRw.png)\n\n\n\n#### image source : https://medium.com/@sonish.sivarajkumar/recommendation-engine-beginners-guide-aec32708e5b9","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Now, we can recommend products to users in different ways.\n\n- We can recommend items to a user which are most popular among all the users.\n\n- We can divide the users into multiple segments and based on their preferences we recommend items to them.\n\n- The working of a recommendation engine can be categorized in three steps-\n\n\n1. Data collection\n2. Data storage\n3.

These are as follows:-\n\n- 1. **[Collaborative Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)** – based on similar users.\n\n- 2. **[Content-Based Filtering](http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/)** – based on product attributes.\n\n- The difference between the above two approaches are shown in the following diagram-","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Collaborative Vs Content Based Filtering](https://miro.medium.com/max/1064/1*mz9tzP1LjPBhmiWXeHyQkQ.png)\n\n\n\n#### image source : https://towardsdatascience.com/brief-on-recommender-systems-b86a1068a4dd","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are several other approaches for recommender systems used in practice.

[Collaborative Filtering Recommender System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- In the [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) recommender system, the behaviour of a group of users is used to make recommendations to other users.\n\n- In this case, the system don’t have any knowledge about the product.\n\n- Collaborative filtering approach build a model from a user’s past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users.\n\n- This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.\n\n- It recommends based on the user’s rating in the past.\n\n- These systems try to predict the user’s rating or preferences based on past rating or preferences of other users.\n\n- These filters do not require item metadata to make predictions.\n\n- There are two types of collaborative filtering recommender system. They are:-\n\n\n### **1. User-based collaborative filtering**\n\n- In this method products are recommended to a user based on the fact that the products have been liked by users similar to the user.\n\n### **2. Item-based collaborative filtering**\n\n- This method identifies and predict similar items based on users’ previous ratings.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Collaborative filtering methods are also classified as memory-based and model-based**\n\n\n- An example of memory-based approach is the user-based algorithm while that of model-based approach is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.\n\n\n- Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems - \n\n    - 1. cold start \n    - 2. scalability  \n    - 3. sparsity\n    \n    \n- These are discussed below:-\n\n\n#### **1. Cold start**\n\n- Cold start refers to a problem, when for a new user or item there is not enough data to make recommendations.\n\n\n\n#### **2. Scalability**\n\n- To make recommendations, we need to choose from millions of users and products. So scalability means a large amount of computation power is required to make recommendations.\n\n\n#### **3. Sparsity**\n\n- The number of items sold on e-commerce portals are extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.\n\n\n\n- Most famous example of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y). This algorithm is popularized by Amazon recommender system.\n\n- Social network companies like Facebook, originally used collaborative filtering to recommend new friends and groups by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends.\n\n- The diagram below demonstrates collaborative filtering recommender systems.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Collaborative Filtering Recommender System](https://miro.medium.com/max/3040/0*o0zVW2O6Rv-LI5Mu.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n#### image source : https://medium.com/@tomar.ankur287/user-user-collaborative-filtering-recommender-system-51f568489727","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **4. [Content-based Filtering Recommender System](http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/)** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"4\"></a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Another common approach when designing recommender systems is [Content-based Filtering](http://recommender-systems.org/content-based-filtering/).\n\n- Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences.\n\n- These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user.\n\n- In content based filtering recommender system, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products.\n\n- The system uses the knowledge of each product to recommend a new product.\n\n- Content-based filtering approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.\n\n- For example, in a content based movie recommender system, the similarities between the movies is calculated on the basis of genres, the actors and the director.\n\n- The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, then he will also like an item similar to it.\n\n- Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.\n\n- The diagram below demonstrates content-based filtering recommender systems.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Content Based Filtering Recommender System](https://miro.medium.com/max/828/1*1b-yMSGZ1HfxvHiJCiPV7Q.png)\n\n\n\n\n#### image source : https://medium.com/data-science-101/movie-recommendation-system-content-filtering-7ba425ca0920","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **5.

Risk-aware Recommender Systems** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"6\"></a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n\n- The existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information.\n\n- They do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user with unwanted notifications.\n\n- It is important to consider the risk of disturbing the user by pushing recommendations in certain circumstances.\n\n- For example, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night.\n\n- Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends to an extent how much risk it has incorporated into the recommendation process.\n\n- One option to manage this issue is DRARS, a system which models the context-aware recommendation as a bandit problem.\n\n- This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **7. Mobile Recommender Systems** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"7\"></a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Mobile recommender systems make use of internet-accessing smart phones to offer personalized and context-sensitive recommendations.\n\n- There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: **context**, **recommendation method** and **privacy**.\n\n- Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions.\n\n- One example of a mobile recommender system are the approaches taken by companies such as Uber and Lyft to generate driving routes for taxi drivers in a city.\n\n- This system uses GPS data of the routes that taxi drivers take while working. It includes location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers).\n\n- It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **8. Hybrid Recommender Systems** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"8\"></a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Most recommender systems now use a hybrid approach.\n\n- It means to combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and other approaches.\n\n- Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways which are as follows:\n\n1. By making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them.\n2. By adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa) or\n3. By combining the approaches into one model.\n\n\n- An example of hybrid recommender systems is Netflix website.\n\n- The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).\n\n\nSome hybridization techniques include:\n\n\n• **Weighted**: Combining the score of different recommendation components numerically.\n\n• **Switching**: Choosing among recommendation components and applying the selected one.\n\n• **Mixed**: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.\n\n• **Feature Combination**: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.\n\n• **Feature Augmentation**: Computing a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.\n\n• **Cascade**: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.\n\n• **Meta-level**: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **9.

Evaluating Recommender Systems** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10\"></a>\n\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\n- Once we develop a recommender system, we want to evaluate them.\n\n- Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommender systems.\n\n- To measure the effectiveness of recommender systems, three types of evaluations are available – \n\n  - 1. user studies, \n  - 2. online evaluations (A/B tests), and \n  - 3. offline evaluations.\n  \n  \n- The commonly used metrics are the mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error(RMSE).\n\n- The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall are useful to assess the quality of a recommender system.\n\n- Diversity, novelty and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.\n\n- User studies are rather small scale judgement technique. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users’ judge which recommendations are the best.\n\n- In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. \n\n- The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as conversion rate or click-through rate.\n\n- Offline evaluations are based on historic data. For example, a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.\n\n- The effectiveness of recommendation system is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Beyond measures of accuracy**\n\nResearch on recommender systems is focussed towards finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. There are a number of factors that are also important. These are discussed below.\n\n- **Diversity** – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity. For example, items from different artists.\n\n- **Recommender persistence** – Sometimes, it is more effective to re-show recommendations than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time. May be they do not inspect the recommendations initially.\n\n- **Privacy** – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns because users have to reveal sensitive information.\n\n- **User demographics** – User demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.\n\n- **Robustness** – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.\n\n- **Serendipity** – Serendipity is a measure of how surprising the recommendations are. For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate. But it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy.\n\n- **Trust** – A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system. Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.\n\n- **Labelling** – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labelling of the recommendations.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **11.

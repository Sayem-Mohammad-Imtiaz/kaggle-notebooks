This data is collected because the NYC Council passed Local Law #11 in 2011. This data is manually run every month and reviewed by the TrafficStat Unit before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a collision in NYC by city, borough, precinct and cross street. This data can be used by the public to see how dangerous/safe intersections are in NYC. The information is presented in pdf and excel format to allow the casual user to just view the information in the easy to read pdf format or use the excel files to do a more in-depth analysis.\n\nContext This is a dataset hosted by the City of New York. The city has an open data platform found here and they update their information according the amount of data that is brought in. Explore New York City using Kaggle and all of the data sources available through the City of New York organization page!\n\nUpdate Frequency: This dataset is updated daily. Acknowledgements This dataset is maintained using Socrata's API and Kaggle's API. Socrata has assisted countless organizations with hosting their open data and has been an integral part of the process of bringing more data to the public.\n\nOne more thing:\n\n**This is my first project in Python.** \nI am learning a lot, but practically I donÂ´t know exactly what to do. Later I hope that I would be able to  improve my kernels and that will be better."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nypd-motor-vehicle-collisions.csv\", low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"471188653e662299a4f4f9233a4b0915a9673b20"},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1d3134fffce80093d1962a2419323a3001ce0892","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(nypd_crash)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"59ac6f0656a5cb89fd9d773f94028726d7455705"},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5a91daa3c5f0b754bbd7a431a2f80d3a14fb1d00","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3c6464d3a5508ca6f976c9b064cc3772b8588cdc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"66a703b89f1623bc8bd32440522b45187fe0c2b3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"nypd_crash.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2cb4db3af8b535f3277d6e0bcec4dddee75aaf6f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"TOTAL NUMBER OF KILLED BY CAR:\")\nkilledStats = nypd_crash['NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED'].value_counts(dropna = False)\nkilledStats.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(8,8))\nplt.ylabel(\"Total No. of Killed\")\nplt.xlabel(\"QUANTITY\")\nplt.show();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"690d8ebaace2c088afa0509905bb50968155c35c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# CROSS STREET NAMES\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nsns.countplot(nypd_crash['CROSS STREET NAME'])\nplt.title('CROSS STREET Distribution')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b638502f96b054ead7f43aa46e0b586fc9173bf1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# count of INJURED PEDESTRIANS\nPEDESTRIANS= nypd_crash['NUMBER OF PEDESTRIANS INJURED'].value_counts() \n\nplt.figure(num=None, figsize=(8, 6), dpi=80, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\nPEDESTRIANS[:10].plot.bar()\nplt.title('Count for INJURED PEDESTRIANS')\nplt.ylabel('Quantity')      \nplt.show();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7899dea4df70ae04066418d3dadd1c5097a9d67f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 10))\n(nypd_crash[['UNIQUE KEY', 'NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED']].groupby(['NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED'])['UNIQUE KEY'].nunique().sort_values()).plot.barh(ax=ax)\nplt.title('Events by INJURED PERSONS')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d43bd80a186837525e6d8527ca6ecf7f13800ac0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

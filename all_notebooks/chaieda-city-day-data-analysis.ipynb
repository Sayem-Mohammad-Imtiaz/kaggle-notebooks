While pollution caused by firecrackers and climatic condition is a seasonal contributor, according to the Gujarat ENVIS Centre, major contributors to air pollution are industries and vehicles. Most air contaminants originate from combustion processes. Your money will be used in better wastewater treatment, solid-waste management, and hazardous-waste management. Also, big-scale air purifiers can be installed on various hotspots.\n\nYou can also use your influence to spread awareness among citizens and government of India. Government can play a crucial role in combating air pollution by makins strict rules and punishing violators.\n\nIf this project is successful, you can look forward to Delhi and Patna.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

It can be seen that the countries of North America (the US, Mexico and Canada), Australia, New Zealand and the western countries of Europe have the happiest citizens. Countries that have lower happiness scores are the ones that are either war struck (eg., Iraq) or are highly underdeveloped as can be said of the countries in Africa like Congo and Chad.

Larger the circle, happier the citizens while darker the circle, higher the GDP. From this plot, we can see that the top 5 countries we have seen above definitely have a much higher GDP. **This seems to imply that more well off a country is economically, the happier its citizens are.** Also, the underdeveloped countries like Chad, Congo, Burundi and Togo have a very low GDP and also a very low happiness score. While we cannot directly say that low GDP implies lower happiness, it seems like an important factor. This trend remain consistent throughout all the countries. **There are almost no countries that have a high GDP but low happiness index or vice versa.**\n\nAlso geographic location and neighbours may be playing an important role. We can clusters/regions with countries having similar GDPs and similar Happiness Scores. **So countries that have a good economy and good relations with their neighbours benefit from mutual growth and this is also reflected in their happiness scores. Countries that have disturbed neighbourhoods, like in middle east Asia (Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.), show much lower growth/economic prosperity as well as lower happiness scores.**\n\nOne thing that can also be noted is that in general, countries which are known for their lower population densities (https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-least-densely-populated-places-in-the-world-2015.html) like Denmark and Iceland are much happier than the more densly populated countries."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"66b11b12db2419b6f1791e43924d302f27b56f26"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.merge(map_data, how='left', on = ['Country'])\ndf.head()","execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"af54c1c1ce5aac1dde77106061641050fc0e9201"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['Happiness Score'].min(), df['Happiness Score'].max()","execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c8cc65fd573cb5cf514096cc9f2a8975e7e4b183"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['text']=df['Country'] + '<br>Happiness Score ' + (df['Happiness Score']).astype(str)\nscl = [ [0,\"rgb(5, 10, 172)\"],[0.35,\"rgb(40, 60, 190)\"],[0.5,\"rgb(70, 100, 245)\"],\\\n    [0.6,\"rgb(90, 120, 245)\"],[0.7,\"rgb(106, 137, 247)\"],[1,\"rgb(220, 220, 220)\"] ]\n\ndata = [ dict(\n        type = 'scattergeo',\n        locationmode = 'country names',\n        lon = df['Longitude'],\n        lat = df['Latitude'],\n        text = df['text'],\n        mode = 'markers',\n        marker = dict(\n            size = df['Happiness Score']*3,\n            opacity = 0.8,\n            reversescale = True,\n            autocolorscale = False,\n            symbol = 'circle',\n            line = dict(\n                width=1,\n                color='rgba(102, 102, 102)'\n            ),\n            colorscale = scl,\n            cmin = 0,\n            color = df['Economy (GDP per Capita)'],\n            cmax = df['Economy (GDP per Capita)'].max(),\n            colorbar=dict(\n                title=\"GDP per Capita\"\n            )\n        ))]\n\nlayout = dict(\n        title = 'Happiness Scores by GDP',\n        geo = dict(\n#             scope='usa',\n            projection=dict( type='Mercator' ),\n            showland = True,\n            landcolor = \"rgb(250, 250, 250)\",\n#             subunitcolor = \"rgb(217, 217, 217)\",\n#             countrycolor = \"rgb(217, 217, 217)\",\n            countrywidth = 0.5,\n            subunitwidth = 0.5\n        ),\n    )\n\nsymbolmap = go.Figure(data = data, layout=layout)\n\niplot(symbolmap)","execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"1e5cb3ed6cb06a85b6c290bc320e7990fb792976"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

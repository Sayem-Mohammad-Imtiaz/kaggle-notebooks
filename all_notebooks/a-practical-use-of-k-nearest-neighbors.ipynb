If we set larger k values,we get a cleaner cutoff at the expense of mislabelling some points\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Here's an visualization of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/mgkn92xck0z05v7yjq8pqziukxvc2461.png\">\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color=\"blue\" >\nIn this case, we have data points of Class A and B.

The success of a business is the ability to satisfy customers and make them happy, and therefore turn a profit from them. To achieve a business success, the business has to find the right potential customers. \nUsing customers’ data can help to build models for predicting the future behaviors of the customers and targeting customers who  help the business to make more money. \n\nIn this project, I will analyze a mall customers’ dataset to answer the following question:\n* Who is the customers we should target?\n\nTo answer this question, I will build a K-means clustering model to group the customers by their characteristics.

Posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n\nThis project will analyze two kinds of posts:  posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n\nThese two types of posts will be compared to determine whether Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average and if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment

Since its inception in 1992, GroupLens's research projects have explored a variety of fields including:\n\n* recommender systems\n* online communities\n* mobile and ubiquitious technologies\n* digital libraries\n* local geographic information systems\n\nGroupLens Research operates a movie recommender based on collaborative filtering, MovieLens, which is the source of these data. We encourage you to visit <http://movielens.org> to try it out! If you have exciting ideas for experimental work to conduct on MovieLens, send us an email at <grouplens-info@cs.umn.edu> - we are always interested in working with external collaborators.\n\n\nContent and Use of Files\n========================\n\nFormatting and Encoding\n-----------------------\n\nThe dataset files are written as [comma-separated values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (`,`) are escaped using double-quotes (`\"`). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Misérables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.\n\n\nUser Ids\n--------\n\nMovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).\n\n\nMovie Ids\n---------\n\nOnly movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id `1` corresponds to the URL <https://movielens.org/movies/1>). Movie ids are consistent between `ratings.csv`, `tags.csv`, `movies.csv`, and `links.csv` (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).\n\n\nRatings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAll ratings are contained in the file `ratings.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,rating,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nRatings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nTags Data File Structure (tags.csv)\n-----------------------------------\n\nAll tags are contained in the file `tags.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:\n\n    userId,movieId,tag,timestamp\n\nThe lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.\n\nTags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.\n\nTimestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.\n\n\nMovies Data File Structure (movies.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nMovie information is contained in the file `movies.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,title,genres\n\nMovie titles are entered manually or imported from <https://www.themoviedb.org/>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.\n\nGenres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:\n\n* Action\n* Adventure\n* Animation\n* Children's\n* Comedy\n* Crime\n* Documentary\n* Drama\n* Fantasy\n* Film-Noir\n* Horror\n* Musical\n* Mystery\n* Romance\n* Sci-Fi\n* Thriller\n* War\n* Western\n* (no genres listed)\n\n\nLinks Data File Structure (links.csv)\n---------------------------------------\n\nIdentifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file `links.csv`. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:\n\n    movieId,imdbId,tmdbId\n\nmovieId is an identifier for movies used by <https://movielens.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://movielens.org/movies/1>.\n\nimdbId is an identifier for movies used by <http://www.imdb.com>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/>.\n\ntmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <https://www.themoviedb.org>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862>.\n\nUse of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.\n\n\nCross-Validation\n----------------\n\nPrior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see [LensKit](http://lenskit.org) for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movies","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ratings","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tags","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"links","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def weight_rating(ratings, p = 0.95):\n    \"\"\"\n    R: average for the movie (mean) = (Rating)\n    v = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n    m = minimum votes requred to be list in the top 5%\n    C = the mean vote across the whole report\n    \"\"\"\n    rating_data = ratings.copy()\n    rating_data['count'] = 1\n    rating_data = rating_data.pivot_table(index = 'movieId', aggfunc = {'rating': 'mean', 'count': 'sum'})\n\n    m = rating_data['count'].quantile(p)\n    rating_data = rating_data[rating_data['count'] >= m]\n\n    R = rating_data['rating']\n    v = rating_data['count']\n\n    C = rating_data['rating'].mean()\n    \n    rating_data['weight_rating'] = ((v / (v + m)) * R) + ((m / (v + m)) * C)\n    \n    return rating_data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rating_data = weight_rating(ratings, p = 0.95)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rating_data['weight_rating'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 1, figsize = (25, 10))\nrating_data['rating'].plot(kind = 'kde', ax = ax1)\nrating_data['weight_rating'].plot(kind = 'kde', color = 'r', ax = ax1)\nfig.suptitle('Distribution of original rating and weight rating', fontsize = 18)\nplt.legend(loc = 'best', fontsize = 15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.merge(left = movies.set_index(['movieId']), right = rating_data, how = 'inner', left_index = True, right_index = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['genres']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ncount_vector = CountVectorizer(ngram_range = (1,3))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"c_vector_genres = count_vector.fit_transform(data['genres'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\ngenres_similarity = cosine_similarity(c_vector_genres, c_vector_genres).argsort()[:,::-1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"if 'title' in data.columns:\n    data = data.set_index(['title'])\nlist_movie = data.index","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"movie = 'Toy Story (1995)'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def recommend_movie_by_similar_movie(movie, n_recommend = 3, genres_similarity = genres_similarity, data = data):\n    \"\"\"\n    movie: 추천 받고자하는 movie (ex: 'Toy Story (1995)')\n    n_recommend: 추천받을 영화의 수\n    genres_similarity: genres에 대한 cosine similarity matrix\n    data: moive의 index를 위한 데이터\n    \"\"\"\n    # pick movie index\n    movie_index = list(data.index).index(movie)\n    \n    # extract movie's cosine similarity matrix\n    movie_genres_similarity = genres_similarity[movie_index, :(n_recommend +1)].reshape(-1)\n    movie_genres_similarity = [ix for ix in movie_genres_similarity if ix != movie_index]\n    \n    # convert recommend movie list\n    recommend_movies = [data.index[ix] for ix in movie_genres_similarity]\n    \n    print('Recommend with %s' %(movie))\n    print(recommend_movies)\n\n    return recommend_movies","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"recommend_movie_by_similar_movie(movie = 'Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)', n_recommend = 30)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

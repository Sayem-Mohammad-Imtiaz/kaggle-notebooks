In fact, research has shown that Math skills at school entry predicted math skills in 3rd grade (cit 1) and is paramount to academic achievement later on(cit 2). Creating a preschool programme that adequatley prepares Black/Hispanic children for the rigor of things to come is the only way we can even attempt bridge this gap, that is to try to prevent it from occurring in the first place.  As demostrated earlier, incresed levels of Math proficiency is correlated to highger percentage of SHSAT offer/taker rate. This, however, is a long term solution that will take years before its effects are translated into actual SHSAT statistics, although in this case the evaluation of the effectiveness of such a program should be done using the grade 3 math exam scores instead.\n\nCitations:\n\n1.  http://www.californiakindergartenassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Article-by-Deborah-Stipek-Math-Matters-Even-for-Little-Kids.pdf \n2. http://earlymath.org/earlymath/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Math-Matters-Report_2ndEd1.pdf"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

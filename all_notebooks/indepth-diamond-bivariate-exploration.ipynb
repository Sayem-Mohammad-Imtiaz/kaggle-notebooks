It would be nice to have a linear trend, wouldn't it? It turns out that the x, y, and z dimensions track a much more linear trend against price than carat does. Since carat is more recognizable a feature value, let's add a transformation to the x-axis to see the approximately linear trend.

Faceted histograms will also produce a similar result, though unless the faceting keeps the price axis common across facets, the trend will be harder to see. For each ordinal variable, there are multiple modes into which prices appear to fall. Going across increasing quality levels, you should see that the modes rise in price - this should be the expected effect of quality. However, you should also see that more of the data will be located in the lower-priced modes - this explains the unintuitive result noted in the previous comment. This is clearest in the clarity variable. Let's keep searching the data to see if there's more we can say about this pattern."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we complete the bivariate exploration, we should take a look at some of the relationships between the independent variables.

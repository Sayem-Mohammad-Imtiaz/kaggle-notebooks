Unfortunately, we can't provide concrete tuning rules for every model. Lowering the learning rate can help one model converge efficiently but make another model converge much too slowly. You must experiment to find the best set of hyperparameters for your dataset. That said, here are a few rules of thumb:\n\n*  Training loss should steadily decrease, steeply at first, and then more slowly until the slope of the curve reaches or approaches zero.\n*  If the training loss does not converge, train for more epochs.\n*  If the training loss decreases too slowly, increase the learning rate. Note that setting the learning rate too high may also prevent training loss from converging.\n*  If the training loss varies wildly (that is, the training loss jumps around), decrease the learning rate.\n*  Lowering the learning rate while increasing the number of epochs or the batch size is often a good combination.\n*  Setting the batch size to a very small batch number can also cause instability. First, try large batch size values. Then, decrease the batch size until you see degradation.\n*  For real-world datasets consisting of a very large number of examples, the entire dataset might not fit into memory. In such cases, you'll need to reduce the batch size to enable a batch to fit into memory.\n\nRemember: the ideal combination of hyperparameters is data dependent, so you must always experiment and verify."},{"metadata":{"id":"1GDb-EBTFuX9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can do a hyperparameter tuning procedure in two ways:\n1.

Random Search is a hyperparameter search procedure that is performed on a defined grid of hyperparameters. However, not all hyperparameter combinations are used to train a new model, only some selected randomly, while a process of cross-validation to measure the performance of temporal models. Once the process is complete, the hyperparameters and the best performing model are chosen.\n\nLet's take a look at the implementation of Random Search with Keras, following the steps:\n\n0. Install and import all the packages needed\n1. Define the general architecture of the model through a creation function\n2. Define the hyperparameters grid to be validated\n3. Run the GridSearchCV process\n4. Print the results of the best model\n\nTo execute the hyperparameter tuning procedure we will use the `keras-tuner`, a library that helps you pick the optimal set of hyperparameters for your TensorFlow model."},{"metadata":{"id":"inRKd7kY2NEY","outputId":"79bfbd63-9295-473d-d45d-b099a1e737a6","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ----------------------------- Functional Tuning - Option 2: using Keras Tuner ------------------------------\n# Goal: tune the learning rate\n\n# 0.

This performance is due to the Gradient Descent process. A balance must be sought in the learning rate value, which allows finding the best regression coefficients for which the loss is the minimum.\n\nLet's now look at the general performance of the model, evaluated with our testing set.

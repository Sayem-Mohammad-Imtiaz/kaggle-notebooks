This has a disadvantage though, as we gain no information from those features that you have dropped.\n\n- <b> Feature Selection </b>: We apply some statistical tests in order to rank them according to their importance and then select a subset of features for our work. This again suffers from information loss and is less stable as different test gives different importance score to features.\n\n- <b> Feature Extraction </b>: We create new independent features, where each new independent feature is a combination of each of the old independent features.

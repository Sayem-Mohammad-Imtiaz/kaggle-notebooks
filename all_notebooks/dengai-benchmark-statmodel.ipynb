It's real bad. Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash and muscle and joint pain. But severe cases are dangerous, and dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure and even death.\n\nBecause it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.\n\nWe've [launched a competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/) to use open data to predict the occurrence of Dengue based on climatological data.

For example, we see that our model in blue does track the seasonality of Dengue cases. However, the timing of the seasonality of our predictions has a mismatch with the actual results. One potential reason for this is that our features don't look far enough into the past--that is to say, we are asking to predict cases at the same time as we are measuring percipitation. Because dengue is misquito born, and the misquito lifecycle depends on water, we need to take both the life of a misquito and the time between infection and symptoms into account when modeling dengue. This is a critical avenue to explore when improving this model.\n\nThe other important error is that our predictions are relatively consistent--we miss the spikes that are large outbreaks. One reason is that we don't take into account the contagiousness of dengue. A possible way to account for this is to build a model that progressively predicts a new value while taking into account the previous prediction. By training on the dengue outbreaks and then using the predicted number of patients in the week before, we can start to model this time dependence that the current model misses.\n\nSo, we know we're not going to win this thing, but let's submit the model anyway!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sj_test, iq_test = preprocess_data('../input/DengAI_Predicting_Disease_Spread_-_Test_Data_Features.csv')\n\nsj_predictions = sj_best_model.predict(sj_test).astype(int)\niq_predictions = iq_best_model.predict(iq_test).astype(int)\n\nsubmission = pd.read_csv(\"../input/DengAI_Predicting_Disease_Spread_-_Submission_Format.csv\",\n                         index_col=[0, 1, 2])\n\nsubmission.total_cases = np.concatenate([sj_predictions, iq_predictions])\nsubmission.to_csv(\"benchmark.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://community.drivendata.org/uploads/default/original/1X/7af03e4997e8487057a77f9022691b9e9cb525f7.png)\n\nAlright, it's a start!

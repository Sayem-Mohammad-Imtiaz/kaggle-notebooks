Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.\n\n## Business and Data Understanding\nSpark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:\n\nIt wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment.\n\nIt wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.\n\n## Strategy\nSpark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are investing.\n\n## Business objective\nThe business objectives and goals of data analysis are pretty straightforward.\n\n__Business objective__ The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'.\n\n__Goals of data analysis__ Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:\n\nInvestment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.\nCountry analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as well.\n\nSector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors. (Note that we are interested in the eight 'main sectors' provided in the mapping file. The two files — companies and rounds2 — have numerous sub-sector names; hence, you will need to map each sub-sector to its main sector.)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6cce1ff3e27d0a9d8f99e2b42d5ce875f8838270"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Loading and Cleaning"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"74685c3129a62ab95a4d0003941827a82c0a0fbf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Supress Warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n# Importing libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d362d31a0d0a4b64c46bbbdd00cae9734ddd4399"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###  Data Loading"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"17ed1035b0d2a73f65cad96e29b4e6ad36a374b9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Setting working directory to required location\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"31bee1996b71bedda021b4dda49a1d860d3d3aa8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# reading data files\n# using encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\" to avoid pandas encoding error\nrounds = pd.DataFrame(pd.read_csv( \"../input/rounds2.csv\", encoding = \"LATIN-1\"))\nrounds.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"31bee1996b71bedda021b4dda49a1d860d3d3aa8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"companies = pd.DataFrame(pd.read_csv(\"../input/companies.txt\", sep=\"\\t\", encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\"))\ncompanies.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"17f606bfebd94d218351b4626cbd54b53aa33fec"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data inspection"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bb73436ed7b1c078dcfd6e66da3f3708069059b8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"companies.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"fb80c4bc8e2319719540e41aed6230cb96571b61"},"cell_type":"code","source":"companies.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2b47286f20e4a47d4a07f85f3b3b3e66de997e22"},"cell_type":"code","source":"companies.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1e3db51320515dadfaf6896b263c09e70cadc2f5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# inspect the structure \nrounds.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"72cf225d7a1fe0118ae42e9b3b4e2e76ba9fedb5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rounds.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9ae88d921368d8af70970f660259db2ba456af17"},"cell_type":"code","source":"rounds.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"528468fa05cc861a4b55e0ff010c4b0977ea5cc3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Cleaning"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4193d41db2385938562a3618ecd91cbb35234de"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ideally, the permalink column in the companies dataframe should be the unique_key of the table, having 66368 unique company names (links, or permalinks).<br>\nAlso, these 66368 companies should be present in the rounds file.<br>\nLet's first confirm that these 66368 permalinks (which are the URL paths of companies' websites) are not repeating in the column, i.e. they are unique.<br>\nAlso, let's convert all the entries to lowercase (or uppercase) for uniformity."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"700768014961c3776db1baac1fd845b5ae3cb574"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# converting all permalinks to lowercase\ncompanies['permalink'] = companies['permalink'].str.lower()\nlen(companies.permalink.unique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e99fd740b5225d6e3468bf8bb486e30eed9aaa26"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thus, there are 66368 unique companies in the table and permalink is the unique primary key.

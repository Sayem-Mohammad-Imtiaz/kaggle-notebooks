Keras, a python API useful for deep learning, was used to create, train, and evaluate the model. Origionally, this project started with tenserflow, but on the recomendation of a friend who works with lots of neural networks, recommended the use of keras and pandas.\n\nThe biggest difference observed between the two models are how quickly they learn. The MNIST model performs much better than the fashion MNIST model with the same number of epochs. Over seceral different models, the MNIST model seems to have about a 80-90% accuracy with 40 epochs, whereas the fashion MNIST model has about a 40-60% accuracy with 40 epochs. I believe this is due in part to the fashion MNIST database having harder images to classify than the MNIST database (where some images can be identified based off 1 pixel in the image). \n\nThe decision for each model to have 3 hidden layers with 10, 9, and 8 neurons respectively was arbitrary. Origionally they both had 7, 6, and 5 neurons, but they didn't perform nearly as well as desired.

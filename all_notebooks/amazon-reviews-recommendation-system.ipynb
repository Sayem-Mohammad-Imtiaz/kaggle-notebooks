Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n\n### <u>Attribute Information:</u>\n* userId : Every user identified with a unique id\n* productId : Every product identified with a unique id\n* Rating : Rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n* timestamp : Time of the rating ( ignore this column for this exercise)\n\n### <u>Objective:</u>\nBuild a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on the their previous ratings for other products.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Types of recommendations\n\nThere are mainly 6 types of the recommendations systems :-\n\n1. Popularity based systems :- It works by recommeding items viewed and purchased by most people and are rated high.It is not a personalized recommendation.\n2. Classification model based:- It works by understanding the features of the user and applying the classification algorithm to decide whether the user is     interested or not in the prodcut.\n3. Content based recommedations:- It is based on the information on the contents of the item rather than on the user opinions.The main idea is if the user likes an item then he or she will like the \"other\" similar item.\n4. Collaberative Filtering:- It is based on assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste. it is mainly of two types:\n a) User-User \n b) Item -Item\n \n5. Hybrid Approaches:- This system approach is to combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches . \n6. Association rule mining :- Association rules capture the relationships between items based on their patterns of co-occurrence across transactions.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\n#importing necessary Libraries \n\n#working with data\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn import model_selection\n\n\nimport sklearn \nfrom sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfrom surprise import SVD\nfrom surprise import KNNWithMeans\nfrom surprise import Dataset\nfrom surprise import accuracy\nfrom surprise import Reader\nfrom surprise.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport os\n\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n%matplotlib inline\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <font color='red'>Step 1 </font> Read and explore the given dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Data=pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/amazon-product-reviews/ratings_Electronics (1).csv\",names=['UserId', 'ProductId','Rating','timestamp'])\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Display the data\n\nData.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#checking datatypes of each column\nData.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#shape of data \nshape_Data = Data.shape\nprint('Data set contains \"{x}\" number of rows and \"{y}\" number of columns' .format(x=shape_Data[0],y=shape_Data[1]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#null check\nsns.heatmap(Data.isnull(),yticklabels=False,cbar=False,cmap='viridis')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Oveview of Data\nData.describe().T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Total data \")\nprint(\"-\"*50)\nprint(\"\\nTotal no of ratings :\",Data.shape[0])\nprint(\"Total No of Users   :\", len(np.unique(Data['UserId'])))\nprint(\"Total No of products  :\", len(np.unique(Data['ProductId'])))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Data Understanding\n1.

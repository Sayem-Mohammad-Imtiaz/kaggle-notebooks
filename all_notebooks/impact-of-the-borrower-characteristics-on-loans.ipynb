The main focus was on the Credit Grade, income range, if the borrower is a home owner or not and the borrower employment status.\n\n\n## Dataset Overview\n\nThe data consisted of borrower features of approximately 113,937 loans. The attributes included employment data like the current status and for how long the borrowe have been employed, as well as additional data such as credit grade, income range, etc. Sixty-six data points were removed from the analysis because they weren't going to be used in this analysis."},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import all

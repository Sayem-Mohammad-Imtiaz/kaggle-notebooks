I'm going to be focusing on Data Engineering, Visualization, and Prediction within the Android Permission Dataset. \n\n**Data Engineering:** \n1. How can we deal with the categorical variables in the features?\n2. What can we do to get the most out of the descriptions and names of the apps?\n3. Do we need all of these features or can we get rid of some of them to get a faster model?\n\n**Data Visualizations:**\n1. What are some patterns within the features that may give us a better idea of how to organize the data?\n2. Are the classes balanced?\n3. How well do our features correlate with other features?\n\n**Data Prediction:**\n1. Which model has the highest accuracy out of all the data?\n2. Is there anything specific (false positive or false negative) that the model is having a hard time identifying?\n\nThank you for reading through this notebook and leave a like if you enjoyed

As these fighters do not compete directly, judging the best fighter pound for pound is subjective, and ratings vary. They may be based on a range of criteria including \"quality of opposition\", factors such as how exciting the fighter is or how famous they are, or be an attempt to determine who would win if all those ranked were the same size.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A second possibility is that a fighter could be ranked, or even a champion (champ-champ) in two or more weight classes.

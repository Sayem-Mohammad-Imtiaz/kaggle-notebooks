As you can see above, our chart has South Africa at number one for the most new cases in Africa,\nmore than doubling the amount of cases that Morocco has, who has the second most. However, to our suprise, \nMorocco has a population density of 83 people per Km^2, which is almost twice as more as South Africa. From this research, \nwe could make a very strong arugment that when you look just at the recent studies, population density seems to have\nlittle to no effect on the amount of covid cases that have been confirmed for a country. This also may be caused by a different \nstrand of covid that is more contagious in South Africa than the strand that is effecting Morocco. When you look at the Graph of South Africa, you \nwill see two major rises in both of the number of cases and tests. We learned that this was because when the virus first effected them, their \ngovernment enforced a lockdown to stop the spread as quickly as possible, however, once the numbers started to decrease, all of the policies were \nnot being followed as strongly as they were and maybe should have been, which is the major cause for their second spike in confirmed cases.\"\"\" \nplot_cases('South Africa')\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

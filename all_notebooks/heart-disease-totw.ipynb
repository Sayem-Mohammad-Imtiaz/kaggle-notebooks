As a secondary objective highlight the features which have the greatest impact. As it turns out, this data set was uploaded to Kaggle twice. This submission was initially composed for VolodymyrGavrysh's task, but since it is applicable to another task on the other dataset I will submit it there as well.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to:\n* VolodymyrGavrysh for both the task and for uploading the dataset to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/heart-disease\n* And also Ronit for posting the dataset on Kaggle as well, https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci\n* Shoumik for the Task https://www.kaggle.com/shoumikgoswami\n\nAnd the principal investigator responsible for the data collection at each institution:\n* Hungarian Institute of Cardiology.

It's not perfect, but I'm absolutely satisfied with those results.\n\nI would have liked to get a more accurate model, but due to the limited number of cases I probably was overly cautious of overfitting. I also probably could have used grid search to squeeze a bit more performance out of the model. Furthermore, the data that's needed to supply this model, and effort needed to prepare the data, almost makes it easier just to have a physician evaluate the patient. The original data set has a few more features in it, and I wonder if it would have been worth while to source the added data or if it would have symply created too much noise.\n\nAs one other side note, many of the techniques I chose to use in this notebook scale poorly. So having a small dataset to start with isn't always a bad thing. Alternatively, some of the loops I used could be used on a subset of a larger dataset.\n\nThis year I've challenged myself to complete one task on Kaggle per week, in order to develop a larger Data Science portfolio. If you found this notebook useful or interesting please give it an upvote. I'm always open to constructive feedback. If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or if you would like to collaborate on a future task of the week feel free to leave a comment here or message me directly.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

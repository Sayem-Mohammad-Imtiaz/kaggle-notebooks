There are seventeen million people died from it every year, especially heart disease. Prevention is better than cure. If we can evaluate the risk of every patient who probably has heart disease, that is, not only patients but also everyone can do something earlier to keep illness away.\n\nThis  heart dataset is a real data including important features of patients. This time we will build the predictable model by XGBoost library. Before predict the test dataset, use concept of crossvalid to find the optimised parameters. after that, the model can calculate the weight of each features, so we can easily understand which feature is more influent than others.\n\npulmnory veins is a common technique to figure out the accuracy of the model. From the standpoint of medicine, the recall rate is more important than precision rate because no one want to be misdiagnosed if the one actually have heart disease. So we will check the recall performance. After that, roc curve can help us evaluate the model, and then we'll explore the features if the model is good enough.\n\n this chest pain is the more dangerous pain for male or feamle at a age of 55 for sme people it may attact very eralier too . so be habitutaul to good this , dont addict to the unwanted this as smoking , drinking alchol and many more.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" cvvc","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Analysis\nThere are thirteen features and one target as below:\n* age: The person's age in years\n* sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n* cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n* trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n* chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\n* fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true;

I think that the reasons are our lack of knowledge about heart disease and the life habits. According to the model and features analysis, we know which features that we can do regular self-examinations. \n\nI think the most obvious symptom is chest pain. There are three types of chest pain, but only atypical angina is strongly related to the heart disease. No matter which type of chest pain you have, go to the  respictevely doctor near you!\n\nIn addition, everyone should always keep an eye on the resting blood pressure. The ideal resting blood pressure is lower than 120mmHg, but if your blood pressure is much lower than the 180mmHg, it means that you are under high risk of heart disease. Besides, the problem will not be only heart when the blood pressure is higher than 150mmHg.\n\nLots of electronic devices that can measure heart rate, so it's easier to monitor your own. Record max heart rate to make sure that your heart is still healthy. Once the rate rises year by year, there must be something wrong with you. \n\nSO FINALLLY  this was the conclusion for the report of heart disease of male and female , this really was a experience  to for the first time internship from nit calicut of this heart disease categorization using machine learning.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" DISCUSSIONS : STRESS TESTING ( SEE A CLINICAL WEBSITE)\n * CHEST X-RAY\n * CT ( COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY) SCAN\n * CONTINUOS ECG MONITIRIZING( SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED HOLTER MONITARING)\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* REFERENCES : WWW.KAGGLE.COM(HEART DISEASE CATEGORIZATION) INTERNET , SOCAIL MEDIA, NEWSPAPER AND BASIC KNOWLEDGE .\n    * THANK YOU RESPECTED SIR FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPRTUNIY .","metadata":{}}]}

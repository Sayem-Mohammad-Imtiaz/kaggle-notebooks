In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: \n- In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. \n- In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.\n\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Importing KNeighborsClassifier using Sklearn Library\nNow we will use K-Nearest Neighbors Classification to predict a new record on the basis of this data.

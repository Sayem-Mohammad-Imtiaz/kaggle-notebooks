For more information on AdamW (Adam + weight decay), one can take a look at this blog post. weight_decay value of 0.01 is a good starting point, you can tweak this hyper-parameter and experiment with how it influences the final trained model.\n\nRegularizing the bias and/or LayerNorm has not shown to improve performance and can even be disadvantageous, which is why we disable it here. For more information on this, please check out the following blog post or paper.\n\nHence we create a decay_mask_fn which makes sure that weight decay is not applied to any bias or LayerNorm weights. This can easily be done by passing a mask_fn to optax.adamw.\n\nNOTE: Beginners (myself) can ignore the decay_mask_fn, the changes are minimal if you leave out doing this step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Kartheek Akella  https://www.kaggle.com/asvskartheek/bert-tpus-jax-huggingface/notebook\n\ndef decay_mask_fn(params):\n    flat_params = traverse_util.flatten_dict(params)\n    flat_mask = {path: (path[-1] != \"bias\" and path[-2:] != (\"LayerNorm\", \"scale\")) for path in flat_params}\n    return traverse_util.unflatten_dict(flat_mask)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T21:41:12.320876Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T21:41:12.321372Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T21:41:12.34439Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T21:41:12.321329Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T21:41:12.34286Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Kartheek Akella  https://www.kaggle.com/asvskartheek/bert-tpus-jax-huggingface/notebook\n\ndef adamw(weight_decay):\n    return optax.adamw(learning_rate=learning_rate_function, b1=0.9, b2=0.999, eps=1e-6, weight_decay=weight_decay, mask=decay_mask_fn)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T21:41:18.765922Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T21:41:18.766416Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T21:41:18.772681Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T21:41:18.766372Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T21:41:18.771271Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"adamw = adamw(1e-2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T21:41:59.458435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T21:41:59.45896Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T21:41:59.464892Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T21:41:59.458916Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T21:41:59.463581Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Loss and eval functions\n\nThe standard loss function for regression problems is the MSE loss.

For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n\nIn this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n\n<img src='https://github.com/diskandarnerd/pytorch_challenge/blob/master/assets/Flowers.png?raw=1' width=500px>\n\nThe project is broken down into multiple steps:\n\n* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n\nWe'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.\n\nWhen you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.\n\nFirst up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code. As you work through this notebook and find you need to import a package, make sure to add the import up here."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"60a0756da86a1b0821e18bf7fbcd771bdb2ffc46"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nimport json\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"7y4aJT7plWxe","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true,"_uuid":"06bb021bdfda163c899f5fca298c4c072c1e6bf9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n\nimport torch\nimport torchvision\nfrom torchvision import models,datasets,transforms\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.optim import lr_scheduler\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nimport copy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"692dfb3c45afd175a211a2d1f59c93e392586b8d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#print the pytorch version\ndevice = torch.cuda.is_available()\ndevice, torch.__version__\n\n# check if CUDA is available\ntrain_on_gpu = torch.cuda.is_available()\n\nif not train_on_gpu:\n    print('CUDA is not available.

You can [download the data here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip). The dataset is split into two parts, training and validation. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. If you use a pre-trained network, you'll also need to make sure the input data is resized to 224x224 pixels as required by the networks.\n\nThe validation set is used to measure the model's performance on data it hasn't seen yet. For this you don't want any scaling or rotation transformations, but you'll need to resize then crop the images to the appropriate size.\n\nThe pre-trained networks available from `torchvision` were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For both sets you'll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`, calculated from the ImageNet images.

As usual, you should use one of the pretrained models from `torchvision.models` to get the image features. Build and train a new feed-forward classifier using those features.\n\nWe're going to leave this part up to you. If you want to talk through it with someone, chat with your fellow students! You can also ask questions on the forums or join the instructors in office hours.\n\nRefer to [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1663/view) for guidance on successfully completing this section. Things you'll need to do:\n\n* Load a [pre-trained network](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html) (If you need a starting point, the VGG networks work great and are straightforward to use)\n* Define a new, untrained feed-forward network as a classifier, using ReLU activations and dropout\n* Train the classifier layers using backpropagation using the pre-trained network to get the features\n* Track the loss and accuracy on the validation set to determine the best hyperparameters\n\nWe've left a cell open for you below, but use as many as you need. Our advice is to break the problem up into smaller parts you can run separately. Check that each part is doing what you expect, then move on to the next. You'll likely find that as you work through each part, you'll need to go back and modify your previous code. This is totally normal!\n\nWhen training make sure you're updating only the weights of the feed-forward network. You should be able to get the validation accuracy above 70% if you build everything right. Make sure to try different hyperparameters (learning rate, units in the classifier, epochs, etc) to find the best model. Save those hyperparameters to use as default values in the next part of the project."},{"metadata":{"id":"88EdiP89Qc5n","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true,"_uuid":"63130a9d73b2202bb2f00255967c437fcd9a9c3b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Build and train your network\nmodel = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)\n# Freeze the weights\nfor param in model.parameters():\n    param.requires_grad = False\n    \n#define untrained feed-forward network as a classifier\nnum_inp = model.fc.in_features\nmodel.fc = nn.Linear(num_inp, 102)\nif train_on_gpu:\n    model.cuda()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3731bc556292ee49525914d65a61033cb818e89b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#TO UNFREEZE THE WEIGHTS FOR THE SECOND TIME TRAINING AND DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE OPTIMIZER TOO!\nfor param in model.parameters():\n    param.requires_grad = True\n    \n# train the WHOLE part instead of just the classifier!, THIS IS THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE TRAINING AND REDUCE THE LEARNING RATE TOO!\noptimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.0002, momentum=0.9)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4d8936dfdb3922b294d25eaf7b0799d2afaaa1ee"},"cell_type":"code","source":"models.resnet18()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"08ae6ec2632acc6bc54ec8ec79be8b2cdc0dc542"},"cell_type":"code","source":"criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n#only train the classifier part, the features part are frozen\noptimizer = optim.SGD(model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.002, momentum=0.9)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5e876470288dbf4fd2ec7dcf052606ec15067cb9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Decay LR by a factor of 0.1 every 7 epochs\nexp_lr_scheduler = lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=7, gamma=0.1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c71f0677dd67e7feeb5cac3ea663785930a91d74"},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(train_loader), len(valid_loader), len(train_data), len(valid_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"713b2935a8f47dccc0478566f369a6900592bba3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def train_model(model, criterion, optimizer, scheduler, num_epochs=25):\n    since = time.time()\n\n    best_model_wts = copy.deepcopy(model.state_dict())\n    best_acc = 0.0\n\n    for epoch in range(num_epochs):\n        print('Epoch {}/{}'.format(epoch, num_epochs -

That is, you'll pass an image into the network and predict the class of the flower in the image. Write a function called `predict` that takes an image and a model, then returns the top $K$ most likely classes along with the probabilities. It should look like \n\n```python\nprobs, classes = predict(image_path, model)\nprint(probs)\nprint(classes)\n> [ 0.01558163  0.01541934  0.01452626  0.01443549  0.01407339]\n> ['70', '3', '45', '62', '55']\n```\n\nFirst you'll need to handle processing the input image such that it can be used in your network. \n\n## Image Preprocessing\n\nYou'll want to use `PIL` to load the image ([documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/Image.html)). It's best to write a function that preprocesses the image so it can be used as input for the model. This function should process the images in the same manner used for training. \n\nFirst, resize the images where the shortest side is 256 pixels, keeping the aspect ratio. This can be done with the [`thumbnail`](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) or [`resize`](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail) methods. Then you'll need to crop out the center 224x224 portion of the image.\n\nColor channels of images are typically encoded as integers 0-255, but the model expected floats 0-1. You'll need to convert the values. It's easiest with a Numpy array, which you can get from a PIL image like so `np_image = np.array(pil_image)`.\n\nAs before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`. You'll want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation. \n\nAnd finally, PyTorch expects the color channel to be the first dimension but it's the third dimension in the PIL image and Numpy array. You can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html). The color channel needs to be first and retain the order of the other two dimensions."},{"metadata":{"id":"kaica84xQc50","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"3aceccc8b7f667f2c46a801373f001904f8c9959"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def process_image(image):\n    ''' Scales, crops, and normalizes a PIL image for a PyTorch model,\n        returns an Numpy array\n    '''\n    \n    # TODO: Process a PIL image for use in a PyTorch model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"-NBVUFNnQc54","colab_type":"text","_uuid":"70e1b9ce7ad50e42e162d5e582733e238e1bfcc2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To check your work, the function below converts a PyTorch tensor and displays it in the notebook.

A common practice is to predict the top 5 or so (usually called top-$K$) most probable classes. You'll want to calculate the class probabilities then find the $K$ largest values.\n\nTo get the top $K$ largest values in a tensor use [`x.topk(k)`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html#torch.topk). This method returns both the highest `k` probabilities and the indices of those probabilities corresponding to the classes. You need to convert from these indices to the actual class labels using `class_to_idx` which hopefully you added to the model or from an `ImageFolder` you used to load the data ([see here](#Save-the-checkpoint)). Make sure to invert the dictionary so you get a mapping from index to class as well.\n\nAgain, this method should take a path to an image and a model checkpoint, then return the probabilities and classes.\n\n```python\nprobs, classes = predict(image_path, model)\nprint(probs)\nprint(classes)\n> [ 0.01558163  0.01541934  0.01452626  0.01443549  0.01407339]\n> ['70', '3', '45', '62', '55']\n```"},{"metadata":{"id":"YOHeFxWjQc59","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"3122c4257635c1982c7bc26d4de7708ffcd5bba9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def predict(image_path, model, topk=5):\n    ''' Predict the class (or classes) of an image using a trained deep learning model.\n    '''\n    \n    # TODO: Implement the code to predict the class from an image file","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"FixtADdTQc6A","colab_type":"text","_uuid":"69eee9bfe3d0f7ba8bab01fe36624d3eb912f093"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sanity Checking\n\nNow that you can use a trained model for predictions, check to make sure it makes sense.

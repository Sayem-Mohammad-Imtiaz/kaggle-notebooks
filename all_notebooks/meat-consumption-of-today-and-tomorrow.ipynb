Introduction\n\nLast few weeks, I became obsessed with the topic of meat consumption. I am constantly thinking about the following: What are the pros and cons of meat consumption in 21st century? What are the driving factors of increase or decrease in consumption of meat - dietary trends,increase in living standards etc. ? Is the current and predicted consumption of meat (year 2026 in this dataset) sustainable in longterm for our planet? üåç These questions are way much more complex to be answered within scope of this notebook. I hope that soon enough as my knowledge of the topic, statistics and python libraries will improve, it will enable me somehow to answer these questions mentionned above as well. For now, I want to stay down-to-earth and redirect my thoughts on the following questions ->\n\n**We will deal with the following questions in this dataset:**\n\n1. Which type of meat is now the most consumed worldwide? (year = 2020, both Measures)\n1. Which type of meat will be the most consumed worldwide? (both Measures)\n1. What was and what is predicted to be the total meat consumption in kilograms per capita in every single year from 90's to 20's?\n1. What is the meat consumption in India, both in thousand tonnes and in kg/cap? (just for my own curiosity!)\n\n\n**We will deal with the following columns:**\n\n* LOCATION = country code representing either country or international organisation\n* SUBJECT = type of meat (Beef, Pork, Poultry, Mutton)\n* MEASURE = type of unit measure (KG_CAP=kilograms per capita,THND_TONNE=thousand tonnes) \n* TIME = year when the data were recorded\n* Value = value represented either in kg/cap or thousand tonnes\n\nAfter our exploration of the dataset, I will provide additional questions to think about but which may also serve as starting point for further analysis of this topic.\n\n**Let's dive right into the amazing world of Python libraries!** üêç Oh and if any additional questions will pop up during your exploration of this notebook, please let me know in the comments below! I will try to answer them as well.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Import libraries**\n\nFirst of all, let's import some of the Python üêç data libraries necessary to be able to load, transform and visualise our dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandasql as ps \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2.

(see the following source for more specific information: https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/10/how-much-water-food-production-waste).

However, this field communicates the suicide rate per-100K people which is a very useful piece of information, so we may want to keep it in just to avoid having to calculate it again. In fact, the suicide rate is so notable, that it seems like an excelent variable to focus the EDA on. So we're going to look into: **What factors influence the suicide rate and how?**\n\nAre any other columns redundant? Well, the *age* and *generation* columns are likely to go hand in hand since both are determined by your birth date.

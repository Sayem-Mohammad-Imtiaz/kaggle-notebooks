These data points are a set of observations at specified times and equal intervals, typically with a datetime index and corresponding value. Common examples of time series data in our day-to-day lives include:      \n\n* Measuring weather temperatures \n* Measuring the number of taxi rides per month\n* Predicting a company’s stock prices for the next day\n\n## Components of Time Series\n\nTime series data consist of four components:\n\n* Trend Component: This is a variation that moves up or down in a reasonably predictable pattern over a long period.\n\n* Seasonality Component: is the variation that is regular and periodic and repeats itself over a specific period such as a day, week, month, season, etc.,\n\n* Cyclical Component: is the variation that corresponds with business or economic 'boom-bust' cycles or follows their own peculiar cycles, and\n\n* Random Component: is the variation that is erratic or residual and does not fall under any of the above three classifications.\n\nTo make this concept more clear here is a visual interpretation of the various components of the Time Series.

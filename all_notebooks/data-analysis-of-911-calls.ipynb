Today, people communicate in ways that the designers of the original 911 system could not have envisioned: wireless phones, text and video messages, social media, Internet Protocol (IP)-enabled devices, and more.\n\nThe National 911 Program works with States, technology providers, public safety officials and 911 professionals to ensure a smooth transition to an updated 911 system that takes advantage of new communications technologies. It also creates and shares a variety of resources and tools to help 911 systems.\n\nCreated by Congress in 2004 as the 911 Implementation and Coordination Office (ICO), the National 911 Program is housed within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at the U.S. Department of Transportation and is a joint program with the National Telecommunication and Information Administration in the Department of Commerce\n\nThis is a capstone project for the udemy course [\"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\"\n](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) [](http://)\n\nFor this capstone project we will be analyzing some 911 call data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert).

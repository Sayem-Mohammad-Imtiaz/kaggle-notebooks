In particular for KNN classifier algorithm.\n\nThe Python package \"scikit-hubness\" ( https://pypi.org/project/scikit-hubness/ , https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00706 \"scikit-hubness: Hubness Reduction and Approximate Neighbor Search\" ) proposes (in particular) certain \"hubness reduction\" algorithms which sometimes improve the scores for KNN classifiers. (See some in example in the paper.)\n\n**Present notebook:** Notebook presents example from the original paper.\nKNN with hubness reduction provides improvement in accuracy from 0.793 to 0.893 comparing to standard KNN classifier.\nThe dataset is part of Dexter Dataset. \n\nPS\n\nSome other examples of hubness reduction notebooks on kaggle: \n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/alexandervc/moa-improve-knn-via-scikit-hubness-test-of-idea\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/alexandervc/gendatasetsfromopenml-2-hubnes\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f = '/kaggle/input/hubness-for-high-dimensional-datasets/X_Dexter300from_scikit_hubness.csv'\nX = pd.read_csv(f ,  index_col= 0  )\nX","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f = '/kaggle/input/hubness-for-high-dimensional-datasets/y_Dexter300from_scikit_hubness.csv'\ny = pd.read_csv(f ,  index_col= 0  )\ny","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = y.values.ravel()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(y==1).sum()/len(y)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install scikit-hubness\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Advantage of hubness reduction -

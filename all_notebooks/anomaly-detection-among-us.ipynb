On their way to explore the Mars, the shapeship undergoes series of internal component failure in the navigation and flight parts. It was time for the crew to repair the issues . But there was one Imposter one Betrayer one Anamoly among them and to identify who that is there are set of tasks which has to be performed in the data to reveal who is the imposter in the dataset. \n>\n>To understand what this this project really focuses on is that there are many realtime cases we are witnessing on tracking abonormal data which possess a serious threat to the business in the field of IT, health and various other sectors. Even though the cyber security teams are forging to figure out the anomaly behaviour in the transactions, the system built using algorithms are not efficient enough to capture all anomaly's. Huge millions of money are lost due to the cyber attacks. It not only affects the business revenue but also the reputation and trust of doing business with the firm.\n## Where to find the Imposter ?\n>TO find the imposter in our spaceship, we use [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab),  where we consider speed_6005 which has the dataset with 2500 rows of the speed for specific sensors in the spaceship.<br>\n> \n> **CSV name**: speed_6005.csv\n> \n>\n>In these dataset above, The crew will analyse the dataset with time-series visualizations and perform analysis to detect the anomaly records and thereby capture the imposter. These are crucial records which can help in identify suspicious speed recorded in the sensors.\n>\n>You can also get this code on my GitHub wall [github page](https://github.com/BenRoshan100/Market-Basket-Analysis).\n\n## Tasks in Spaceship\n>* Getting and tweaking the data\n>* Visualization of data and Emergency meetings\n>* Building model to trace anomalies\n>    * using Isolation Forest\n>    * using Facebook Prophet"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href=\"#top\" class=\"btn btn-success btn-sm active\" role=\"button\" aria-pressed=\"true\" style=\"color:white;\">Table of Contents</a>\n\n# 2.

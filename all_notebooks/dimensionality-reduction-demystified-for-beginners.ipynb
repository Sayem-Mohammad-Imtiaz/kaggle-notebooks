Principle Component Analysis (PCA) :\n\nOne very important form of dimensionality reduction is called principal component analysis, or PCA. Intuitively, what PCA does is take your cloud of original data points and finds a rotation of it. So the dimensions are statistically uncorrelated. PCA then typically drops all but the most informative initial dimensions that capture most of the variation in the original dataset.\n\n### Mathematically : (For My Fellow Nerds Out There, I Hear You)\n\nThe principal components of a collection of points in a real p-space are a sequence of direction vectors where the vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first vectors.\n\n### How it Works :\n\n![PCA WORKS](https://intoli.com/blog/pca-and-svd/img/basic-pca.png)\n\nHere, if we have two original features $( X1$ & $X2 )$ that are highly correlated represented by this cloud of points, PCA will rotate the data so the direction $( v1 )$ of highest variance - called the first principal component $( PC1 )$, which is along the long direction of the cloud, becomes the first dimension. It will then find the direction $( v2 )$ at right angles that maximally captures the remaining variance. This is the second principle component $( PC2 )$. In two dimensions, there's only one possible such direction at right angles of the first principal component, but for higher dimensions, there would be infinitely many. With more than two dimensions, the process of finding successive principal components at right angles to the previous ones would continue until the desired number of principal components is reached.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008454,"end_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:14.854605","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:14.846151","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Using PCA to find the first two Principal Components of the Breast Cancer Dataset :","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-09-04T09:41:14.879585Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-09-04T09:41:14.878608Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.241724Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.239974Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.378945,"end_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.241888","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:14.862943","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n# Before applying PCA, each feature should be centered (zero mean) and with unit variance\n#This can be done by using StandardScaler of sklearn Library\ncanc_norm = StandardScaler().fit(X_canc).transform(X_canc)  \n\npca = PCA(n_components = 2).fit(canc_norm) #Fitting PCA with 2 Components\n\ncanc_pca = pca.transform(canc_norm)\n\nprint('Number of Features in Breat Cancer DataSet Before PCA : {}\\n\\nNumber of Features in Breast Cancer DataSet After PCA : {}'\n      .format(X_canc.shape[1],canc_pca.shape[1]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007616,"end_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.258051","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.250435","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Plotting the PCA-Transformed Version of the Breast Cancer Dataset :\n\nAs, You can see the no. of Features of the DataSet are reduced to 2 and Yes, some of the information is lost while using PCA but it comes with the added benefit of better understanding of relation Between Features and better Visualization Capabilities as there are only 2 features ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.291415Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.283244Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.632938Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.633554Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.367323,"end_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.633749","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.266426","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_labelled_scatter(canc_pca, y_canc, ['malignant', 'benign'],(15,9)) #Using the Helper Function\n\n#Labelling\nplt.xlabel('First principal component',fontsize=15)\nplt.ylabel('Second principal component',fontsize=15)\nplt.title('Breast Cancer Dataset PCA (n_components = 2)',fontsize=17);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.009925,"end_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.653451","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-09-04T09:41:15.643526","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, We can see that the two target classes are easily seperable even by a simple logistic regression.

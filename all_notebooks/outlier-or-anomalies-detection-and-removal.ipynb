Outlier Detection Stratgies for diffrent-diffrent destribution","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.1 For Normal or Gaussian Destribution\nIdentifying an observation as an outlier depends on the underlying distribution of the data. In this section, we limit the discussion to univariate data sets that are assumed to follow an approximately normal distribution. If the normality assumption for the data being tested is not valid, then a determination that there is an outlier may in fact be due to the non-normality of the data rather than the prescence of an outlier.\nFor this reason, it is recommended that you generate a normal probability plot of the data before applying an outlier test. Although you can also perform formal tests for normality, the prescence of one or more outliers may cause the tests to reject normality when it is in fact a reasonable assumption for applying the outlier test.\n\nIn addition to checking the normality assumption, the lower and upper tails of the normal probability plot can be a useful graphical technique for identifying potential outliers. In particular, the plot can help determine whether we need to check for a single outlier or whether we need to check for multiple outliers.\n\nThe box plot and the histogram can also be useful graphical tools in checking the normality assumption and in identifying potential outliers.\n\nUse empirical relations of Normal distribution.\n\n– The data points which fall below mean-3*(sigma) or above mean+3*(sigma) are outliers.\n\nwhere mean and sigma are the average value and standard deviation of a particular column.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/679/0*y7kVHEQPQKBg3Cga.)\n\ngood ‘thumb-rule’ z score (how to calculate z score value desecribed in below section) thresholds can be: 2.5, 3, 3.5 or more standard deviations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.2 For Non Gaussian Destribution and For Skewed distributions\n\nIn case of Non Gaussian Destribution one way is to transform the data into normal destribution,or you can Use Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) proximity rule.\n\n– The skewed data points which fall below Q1 – 1.5 IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 IQR are outliers.\n\nwhere Q1 and Q3 are the 25th and 75th percentile of the dataset respectively, and IQR represents the inter-quartile range and given by Q3 – Q1.\nand also for other destribution we can go with the percentile value:\n\n**For Skewed distributions:**\n\nUse Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) proximity rule.\n\n![](https://naysan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/box_plot_ref_needed.png)\n\n**For other destribution :**\n\nUse percentile-based approach.\n\n![](https://acutecaretesting.org/-/media/acutecaretesting/articles/fig-6-example.jpg?h=402&w=750)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2 How to Remove or Replace Outlier \n# **2.1 Caping :** \nIn this technique, we cap our outliers data and make the limit i.e, above a particular value or less than that value, all the values will be considered as outliers, and the number of outliers in the dataset gives that capping number.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*M4ZSmi8idYdsyzEp.png)\n\n# **2.2 Trimming :** \nIt excludes the outlier values from our analysis.

It is a relatively novel method based on binary decision trees. Sci-Kit Learn’s implementation is relatively simple and easy to understand.\nIsolation forest’s basic principle is that outliers are few and far from the rest of the observations. To build a tree (training), the algorithm randomly picks a feature from the feature space and a random split value ranging between the maximums and minimums. This is made for all the observations in the training set. To build the forest a tree ensemble is made averaging all the trees in the forest.\nThen for prediction, it compares an observation against that splitting value in a “node”, that node will have two node children on which another random comparisons will be made. The number of “splittings” made by the algorithm for an instance is named: “path length”. As expected, outliers will have shorter path lengths than the rest of the observations.\nAn outlier score can computed for each observation:\n\nThe isolation number is the number of splits needed to isolate a data point. This number of splits is ascertained by following these steps:\n\n1. A point “a” to isolate is selected randomly.\n\n2. A random data point “b” is selected that is between the minimum and maximum value and different from “a”.\n\n3. If the value of “b” is lower than the value of “a”, the value of “b” becomes the new lower limit.\n\n4. If the value of “b” is greater than the value of “a”, the value of “b” becomes the new upper limit.\n\nThis procedure is repeated as long as there are data points other than “a” between the upper and the lower limit.\n\nIt requires fewer splits to isolate an outlier than it does to isolate a non-outlier, i.e. an outlier has a lower isolation number in comparison to a non-outlier point. A data point is therefore defined as an outlier if its isolation number is lower than the threshold.\n\nThe threshold is defined based on the estimated percentage of outliers in the data, which is the starting point of this outlier detection algorithm.\n\nAn explanation with images of the isolation forest technique is available at https://quantdare.com/isolation-forest-algorithm/.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/placement-data-full-class/Placement_data_full_class.csv')\ndf=df.dropna()\ndf.index=[i for i in range(0,148)]#reindexing\nmodel=IsolationForest(n_estimators=50, max_samples='auto', contamination=float(0.05),max_features=1.0)\nmodel.fit(df[['ssc_p']],df[['hsc_p']])\n\ndg=pd.DataFrame({'ssc_p':df['ssc_p'],\n                 'score':model.decision_function(df[['ssc_p']]),\n                 'anomaly':model.predict(df[['ssc_p']]),\n                 'hsc_p':df['hsc_p']})\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndg2=dg[dg['anomaly']==-1]\ndg2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T14:53:59.83995Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T14:53:59.840359Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T14:54:00.063494Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T14:53:59.840321Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T14:54:00.062486Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Ploting of outlier over data**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nplt.scatter(dg['ssc_p'],dg['hsc_p'])\nplt.scatter(dg2['ssc_p'],dg2['hsc_p'])\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T14:54:06.09508Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T14:54:06.095457Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T14:54:06.27018Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T14:54:06.095427Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T14:54:06.269031Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**print the anomalies**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"anomaly=dg.loc[dg['anomaly']==-1]\nanomaly_index=list(anomaly.index)\nprint(anomaly)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T14:54:34.275031Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T14:54:34.275472Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T14:54:34.285862Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T14:54:34.275434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T14:54:34.284645Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.3 DBScane Anomaly Detection\nThis is a clustering algorithm (an alternative to K-Means) that clusters points together and identifies any points not belonging to a cluster as outliers.

Find all points that are within epsilon distance of each point in the cluster and add them to the cluster. Find all points that are within epsilon distance of all newly added points and add these to the cluster. Rinse and repeat.

Any point that has at least min_samples points within epsilon distance of it will form a cluster. This point is called a core point. The core point will itself count towards the min_samples requirement.\n2. Any point within epsilon distance of a core point, but does not have min_samples points that are within epsilon distance of itself is called a borderline point and does not form its own cluster.\n3. A border point that is within epsilon distance of multiple core points (multiple epsilon balls) will arbitrarily end up in just one of these resultant clusters.\n4. Any point that is randomly selected that is not found to be a core point or a borderline point is called a noise point or outlier and is not assigned to any cluster. Thus, it does not contain at least min_samples points that are within epsilon distance from it or is not within epsilon distance of a core point.\n5.

Find the Kth closest point (Kth nearest neighbor’s distance=K-Dist(P))\n1. Find the K closest points (those whose distances are smaller than the Kth point), the K-distance neighborhood of P, Nk(P).\n1.

The lower the density, the farther p is from its neighbors.\n1. Find its local outlier factor, LOFk(p)   =   sum(reachability distances of neighbors to P) x sum(densities of neighbors).

For step 2, If 2 points have the same distance to P, then just select one as the next closest, and the other as the next next closest.\n1. For step 4, LRD = Local Reachability Density = inverse(avg reachability distance between P and its neighbors) <= 1.

Less high value if -> P is close to its neighbors and its neighbors have low densities (LOF = (low sum) x (low sum) = low value )\n1. Adjusting K:\n1. Increase K too much and you’re just looking for outliers with respect to the entire dataset, so points far away from the highest density regions could be misclassified as outliers, even though they themselves reside in a cluster of points.\n1. Reduce K too much and you’re looking for outliers with respect to very small local regions of points. This could also lead to the misclassification as outliers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/placement-data-full-class/Placement_data_full_class.csv')\ndf=df.dropna()[['degree_p','salary']]\ndf.index=[i for i in range(0,148)]#reindexing | change accordingle to reset index of df\n\nstscaler = StandardScaler().fit(df)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(stscaler.transform(df))\nclf = LocalOutlierFactor(n_neighbors=25, contamination=.09)\ny_pred = clf.fit_predict(df)\nLOF_Scores = clf.negative_outlier_factor_\nLOF_pred=pd.Series(y_pred)\noutliers=df[LOF_pred==-1]\nprint(Counter(LOF_pred))\noutliers","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:17:27.435155Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:17:27.435687Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:17:27.469967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:17:27.43565Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:17:27.469298Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.scatter(df[0],df[1])\nplt.scatter(outliers[0],outliers[1])\nplt.xlabel(\"Degree_p\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Salary\")\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:17:31.411597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:17:31.4121Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:17:31.578328Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:17:31.412066Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:17:31.577554Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.7 Interquartile Range(IQR)\nIQR finds the data point that lies outside the overall distribution of the dataset.\nAny data point that falls outside of 1.5 times of an interquartile range below the 1st quartile and above the 3rd quartile is considered an Outlier.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*FUNw6hD0X-L-WkilD6u3Qg.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/placement-data-full-class/Placement_data_full_class.csv')\n\ndf=df.dropna()[['degree_p','salary']]\n\ndf.index=[i for i in range(0,148)]#reindexing | change accordingle to reset index of df\n\nstscaler = StandardScaler().fit(df)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(stscaler.transform(df))\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:34:24.502293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:34:24.502655Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:34:24.536216Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:34:24.502625Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:34:24.53519Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nq1, q3= np.percentile(df[1],[25,75])\niqr=q3-q1\n#Lower and upper bound for the outliers\nlower_bound = q1 -(2.5 * iqr) \nupper_bound = q3 +(2.5 * iqr)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:37:37.068512Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:37:37.069103Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:37:37.075948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:37:37.069052Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:37:37.07482Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"outliers=df[(df[1]>upper_bound) | (df[1]<lower_bound)]\noutliers","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:37:39.734598Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:37:39.734971Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:37:39.749964Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:37:39.734938Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:37:39.748684Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.scatter(df[1],df[1])\nplt.scatter(outliers[1],outliers[1])\nplt.xlabel(\"Salary\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Salary\")\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T15:38:22.067736Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T15:38:22.068112Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T15:38:22.255104Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T15:38:22.068078Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T15:38:22.254025Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

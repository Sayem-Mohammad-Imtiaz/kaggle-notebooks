I've mainly focused on model building, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization and using K-fold cross validation techique to obtain a high accuracy results using a single model.\n\n1. Building a base line model with SVC\n2. Selecting useful features and removing redundant ones.\n3. Finding right set of parameters using optuna and 10 fold cross validation.\n4. Selecting the best trial making predictions and averaging it from folds.\n\n*Note*: This dataset is comparatively small. The fit time scales at least quadratically with the number of samples and may be impractical beyond tens of thousands of samples. For large datasets consider using `LinearSVC` or `SGDClassifier` instead, possibly after a `Nystroem` transformer."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Useful imports and data loading**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nimport missingno as msno\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the data\ndf_train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/mobile-price-classification/train.csv')\ndf_test = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/mobile-price-classification/test.csv')\ndf_train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Train set shape:', df_train.shape)\nprint('Test set shape:', df_test.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Basic Descriptive statistics and EDA**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets look at some summary statistics of train data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.describe().T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"msno.bar(df_train)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are no missing values in data. \n  \nLets take a look at pairwise relationships between features."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.pairplot(data=df_train, hue='price_range')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(10,7)})\n\nsns.stripplot(x=\"price_range\", y=\"ram\", data=df_train, dodge=True, palette='dark')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above plot we notice the price range is increasing with increase in ram."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.swarmplot(x=\"fc\", y=\"ram\", hue=\"price_range\", data=df_train, dodge=True, palette='deep')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.scatterplot(x=\"ram\", y=\"battery_power\", hue=\"price_range\", data=df_train, palette='deep')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(x = 'price_range' , data = df_train)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train['price_range'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see form the above countplot that the prices are uniformly distributed. \n  \n  Now lets see how our feature variables are correlated using corelation matrix."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corr = df_train.corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr, cmap=\"YlGnBu\", linewidths=.5)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corr.sort_values(by=[\"price_range\"],\n                 ascending=False).iloc[0].sort_values(ascending=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We notice Ram has highest correlation with price."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Creating train and validation sets for training**  \n\nLets break down our train data into two parts one used for training and other for validation.

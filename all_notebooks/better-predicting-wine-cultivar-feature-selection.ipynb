Hyperparameters optimization\n2. Feature extraction\n3. Selecting another model\n4. Adding more data\n5. Feature selection\n\nIn this blog post, I'll walk you through how I used **Feature Selection** to improve my model.\nFor the demonstration I'll use the ['Wine' dataset from UCI ML repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine), which was also available [here at kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/brynja/wineuci)\n\nMost of the functions are from the [sklearn (scikit-learn) module](http://scikit-learn.org/).\n\nFor the plotting functions make sure to read about [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\nBoth are great plotting modules with great documentation.\n\nBefore we jump into the ML model and prediction we need to understand our data.\nThe process of understanding the data is called EDA - exploratory data analysis.\n\n### EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis.\nUCI kindly gave us some basic information about the data set.\nI'll quote some of the more important info given:\n\"These data are the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines ... All attributes are continuous ... 1st attribute is class identifier (1-3)\"\n\nBased on this, it seems like a classification problem with 3 class labels and 13 numeric attributes.\nA classification problem with the goal of predicting the specific cultivar the wine was derived from."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading a few important modules\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set() #sets a style for the seaborn plots.\nnp.random.seed(64)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"columns_names = ['Target', 'Alcohol', 'Malic_acid', 'Ash', 'Alcalinity_of_ash', 'Magnesium', 'Total_phenols', 'Flavanoids',\n                 'Nonflavanoid_phenols', 'Proanthocyanins', 'Color_intensity', 'Hue', 'OD280/OD315_of_diluted_wines', 'Proline']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading the data from it's csv,\n# and converting the 'Target' column to be a string so pandas won't infer it as a numeric value\ndata = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..', 'input', 'Wine.csv'), header=None)\ndata.columns = columns_names\ndata['Target'] = data['Target'].astype(str)\ndata.head() # print the data's top five instances","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I named the first columns as 'Target'.\nThis is the target attribute - what we are trying to predict.\nThis is a classification problem, so the class label ('Target') is not a numeric but a nominal value. that's why I'm telling Pandas this columns dtype is 'str'."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info() # prints out a basic information about the data.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see we have 178 entries (instances).\nas we know from UCI's description of the data, we have 13 numeric attributes and one 'object' type attribute (which is the target column).\nall the columns of all the rows have data, therefore we see \"178 non-null\" next to every column description."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot(data['Target']);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It's important to check the amount of instances in each class.

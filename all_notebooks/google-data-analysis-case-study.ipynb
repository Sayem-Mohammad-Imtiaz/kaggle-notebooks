The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/laborday/cyclistic-data) includes over 3 million rides from April 2020 to March 2021.\n\n###  The dataset contained the following fields:\n\n* ride_id: a set of 16 characters unique to each ride\n\n* rideable_type: the style of bicycle (classic, docked or electric)\n\n* started_at: the date and time that each ride began\n\n* ended_at: the date and time that each ride ended\n\n* start_station_name: which terminal the bike was checked out from\n\n* start_station_id: an ID for each start station\n\n* end_station_name: which terminal the bike was checked into\n\n* end_station_id : an ID for each end station\n\n* start_lat: the latitude of the start station\n\n* start_lng: the longitude of the start station\n\n* end_lat: the latitude of the end station\n\n* end_lng: the longitude of the end station\n\n* member_casual: the membership status of the rider\n\n### I began by using SQL to check the relevant columns for invalid entries.\n\n#### Checking for unique values in the rideable_type column reveals no bad entries:\n```\nSELECT\n  rideable_type,\n  COUNT (rideable_type) AS count\n\nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n\nGROUP BY rideable_type\n```\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/u8lXnYT.png)\n\n#### Checking for earliest and latest dates reveals none are outside of the expected range:\n```\nSELECT\n  MAX(started_at) as max_started_at,\n  MAX(ended_at) as max_ended_at,\n  MIN(started_at) as min_started_at,\n  MIN(started_at) as min_started_at\n\nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n```\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/nozg6fR.png)\n\n#### Creating a temporary table with an extra column to calculate trip length reveals 65,124 rides with length less than or equal to 0 minutes (1.97%), which will be filtered out later:\n```\nWITH temp_table AS (\n \n  SELECT\n    started_at,\n    ended_at,\n    DATE_DIFF (ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) as trip_length\n \n  FROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n)\n\nSELECT\n  started_at,\n  ended_at,\n  trip_length\n \nFROM temp_table\n\nWHERE trip_length = 0 OR trip_length < 0\n\nORDER BY trip_length\n```\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/NgDDstH.png)\n\n#### Checking for min and max coordinates reveals none outside of the expected range:\n```\nSELECT\n  MAX(start_lat) as max_start_lat,\n  MAX(start_lng) as max_start_lng,\n  MIN(start_lat) as min_start_lat,\n  MIN(start_lng) as min_start_lng,\n \n  MAX(end_lat) as max_end_lat,\n  MAX(end_lng) as max_end_lng,\n  MIN(end_lat) as min_end_lat,\n  MIN(end_lng) as min_end_lng\n\nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n```\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/qi2lwgz.png)\n\n#### Checking for unique starting latitudes reveals there is too much decimal precision, creating over 260,000 unique latitudes:\n```\nSELECT\n  start_lat,\n  COUNT(start_lat) as count\n\nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n\nGROUP BY start_lat\n```\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/XRalSfp.png)\n\n#### Trimming decimal places off coordinates reduces the number of unique entries to 1552:\n````\nSELECT\n  TRUNC(start_lat, 4) as trimmed_start_lat,\n  COUNT(TRUNC(start_lat, 4)) as count\n\nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n\nGROUP BY trimmed_start_lat\n````\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/wSXZ9lC.png)\n\n#### Checking for unique values in the member_casual column reveals no bad entries:\n```\nSELECT \n  member_casual,\n  COUNT (member_casual) as count\n  \nFROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data` \n\nGROUP BY member_casual\n```\n![Image](https://imgur.com/y6KP8Gf.png)\n\n#### Now grabbing all the relevant columns (while filtering out the bad time values and trimming the coordinates) and storing them in a new table for analysis:\n```\nWITH cleaned_data AS (\n\n  SELECT\n    rideable_type,\n    started_at,\n    ended_at,\n    DATE_DIFF (ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) as trip_length,\n    TRUNC(start_lat, 4) as trimmed_start_lat,\n    TRUNC(start_lng, 4) as trimmed_start_lng,\n    TRUNC(end_lat, 4) as trimmed_end_lat, \n    TRUNC(end_lng, 4) as trimmed_end_lng,\n    member_casual\n\n  FROM `massive-current-311523.Cyclistic.ride_data`\n)\n\nSELECT *\n\nFROM cleaned_data\n\nWHERE trip_length > 0\n```\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/LM0jR8s.png)\n\n### With the cleaned dataset, I used Tableau to create visualizations summarizing my findings.\n\n#### 1. Members took 59% of rides, compared to 41% from casual riders:\n##### Out of 3,761,854 rides, members took 2,216,736 and casual riders took 1,545,118.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/ttg2tQe.png)\n\n\n#### 2. Casual riders take longer trips than members:\n##### On average, members rode for just under 16 minutes per trip, compared to over 44 minutes per trip by casual riders.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/a8iuxck.png)\n\n#### 3. Everybody rides longer on weekends, especially casual riders:\n##### Trip lengths were below average on weekdays, and above average on weekends.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/FC56GJV.png)\n\n#### 4. Casual riders significantly increase on the weekend:\n##### While the number of rides by members does increase slightly over the course of the week, most casual rides occur on the weekend.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/4e3R6V4.png)\n\n#### 5. Casual riders and members share similar bike preferences:\n##### Docked bikes were the most popular with both members and casual riders. Classic bikes, the least popular, were especially unpopular with casual riders.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/tm2GCVB.png)\n\n#### 6. The number of rides increases throughout the day:\n##### Rides increase with significant events like the start of working hours, lunch time and the end of the work day.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Ot3w7Gl.png)\n\n#### 7. Casual riders take longer trips over the course of the day:\n##### While members take trips consistent in length, the length of casual rides grows dramatically over the day, peaking at 4 am.\n\n![Image](https://imgur.com/jLS2or6.png)\n\n#### 8. Seasonal variation is consistent across both casual riders and members:\n##### Rides peak during early spring and mid-summer.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/VDibFao.png)\n\n#### 9. Casual riders are geographically distinct from members:\n##### By filtering out all but the most popular starting and ending coordinates (10,000+ rides), we see that members tend to ride in different areas than casual riders. Specifically, casual rides mainly occur around local attractions.\n\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/DBovUjo.png)\n\n## Summary\n\n### Unsurprisingly, it appears that casual riders use these bikes for leisure; they ride more on the weekends, they ride for longer and they ride around local attractions.\n### Members appear to use these bikes for commuting; they ride consistently, every day, and for the same amount of time, usually around residential locations.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}

Now, let's look at a case where the model predicted that the patient is suffering from angina but the result is not as obvious. Looking at the top 3 features. \n1. ca = 0. This shows us that no vessels are blocked. This is a good sign, and leads the model to think that the patient does not have a heart disease. \n2. thal = 0. Acting against ca, thallium test shows us that there are some defects in the blood supply and heart cells of the patient. This is a great example that shows us that in real life, results are mixed more often than not. \n3. cp = 3. The patient is suffering from chest pain type 3 (asymptomatic pain). This sounds counter intuitive, but asymptomatic pain is actually the most severe out of all 4 possible chest pain types. So, this leads the model to making a prediction that the patient has a heart disease. \n\nUsing SHAP, we have seen two extreme cases in the same fashion as LIME. Now, we look at a local explanation that isn't as extreme. We see a good mix of Red and Blue feature values from the figure shown above. Looking at both cases individually:\n\n1. The most important feature values influencing the model to make the decision that the patient has a heart disease are thal=2 (Showing that there are some defects in the blood supply and the quality of heart cells of the patient), cp=3 (Showing that the type of chest pain is asymptomatic. This may seem counterintuitive, but asymptomatic chest pain is actually the most severe out of the four types, which leads the model to believe that the patient has a heart disease.)  and chol=307 (High cholestrol leads to blockage of blood vessels of the heart and decreases the overall blood flow in and around the heart). \n\n2. The most important feature value influencing the model to make the decision that the patient does not have a heart disease are ca = 0. This is perhaps the most important feature, and from this we realise that none of the vessels of the patient are blocked.

To be specific, by given consequent set churn = 0, they want to find certain condition sets containing rest of features that have high support, confidence and lift value.\nIn our project, our interest is much more clear: our goal is to find the underlying relationship among all the service status.

Compared with rest rows, rules where antecedents include device protection have lift value 1.60 or higher. (index 17 vs index 6). Convince customers to open Device Protection Service after buying a Streaming Service by highlighting the importance of privacy issues. By improving lift value, probability of buying consequents will be improved largely. \n\n2. Confidence and lift values are high among these rules, which indicates they are bonded tightly, so the important thing is to improve support score of rules, making them happen more frequently. In order to do that, we recommend offering some nice packages (TV, Movies streaming, phone service, device protection) with attractive **discount** to improve the selling amount.\n\n#### Here is a theoretical example for coming up with a optimal discount percentage.\nTo give an example for determining discount percentage, we decided to calculate how much discount to give to customers who have a Streaming Service (TV or Movies) to entice them to buy another Service. Our goal was to find the optimal discount percentage that can bring maximum profit to the Telecom Company. \n\n**Analyzed Data**\nSelected data that pertains to Streaming Movies TV: \n1. Average monthly charges for customers with both Movies and TV = 93.24\n2. No.of customer with both  Streaming Movies and TVs =  1940\n3.

It contains 7 features (4 numerical and 3 categorical), and the target column contains medical expenses incurred by each individual.

For categorical features:\n    a. create a dataframe and clean missing data\n    b. represent data visually in an appropriate format\n    c. drop irrelevant features within reason and logic presented. \n    d. convert categorical variables to represent in a binary format.  \n3. For numerical features:\n    a. create a dataframe and clean missing data\n    b. represent data visually in an appropriate format\n    c. drop irrelevant features within reason and logic presented. \n4. Create a Linear Model, fit and predict the relevant features. \n5. Use appropriate metrics to measure effectiveness of model. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/insurance-premium-prediction/insurance.csv')\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### It is quite lucky that there are no null values to deal with.

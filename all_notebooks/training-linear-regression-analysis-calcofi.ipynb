Most of these missing values are solinity (`47,354` compared to `10,963` for temparature). Luckily, these values are ordered by time, so we can fill the entries using a backfill approach.

It is likely that missing values are caused by an outage over an extended time period instead of separate isolated occasions. This leads to consecutive NaN values in the dataset.

It is strange however that these chains seem to stretch over large temperature ranges, hence the vertical line.\nHowever, this finding could be biased by the visualization.

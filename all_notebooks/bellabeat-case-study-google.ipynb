The Möbius dataset was recommended in order to gain market insights about user behavior in the area of wearable fitness trackers. \n\nI have decided to use Python since I have been learning Python for about half a year and want to grow my skills further. Looking forward to any helpful feedback, especially for shortcuts for some of my lengthy lines of codes.\n\n## Business Task\n\n* Gain insights about how consumers are using their smart devices in order to derive recommendations for Bellabeat's own marketing strategy in terms of new growth opportunities.\n* The following analysis should in particular help drive the growth of Bellabeat's wellness watch which tracks user activity, sleep and stress by revealing insights from a third party dataset \n\nThe following **key stakeholders** are involved in the project:\n* Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer (sponsor)\n* Sando Mur, co-founder and mathematician\n* other members of the executive team\n* the marketing analytics team\n\n## Data source and data integrity\n\nIn order to answer the business task, the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data dataset will be used which has been made available by Möbius here on kaggle. The dataset has been released under a public domain license (CC0) which allows even commercial use.\n\nThe Möbius dataset links to the original dataset at Zenodo:\nURL: https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.YJKvDC-22dp\nThe data has been generated by a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12 and May 12, 2016. However the Möbius dataset only contains the second half of original datset spanning from April 12 - May 12.\nAmazon Mechanical Turk is a platform that allows businesses to connect to workers for on-demand tasks. Therefore it can be assumed that the sponsor of this survey asked FitBit users to provide their data and later aggregated this data. \nAccording to Moss and Litman (URL: https://www.cloudresearch.com/resources/blog/who-uses-amazon-mturk-2020-demographics/ ) the population of Mechanical Turk shows the following **biases**:\n* Age: significantly younger than the US population\n* Gender: imbalance towards more female (57%)\n* Ethnics: Blacks are underrepresented and Asians are overrepresented\n\nThe dataset doesn't contain any further information how the sample set has been defined. Could anybody take part in the survey or have certain selection criteria been defined? Participants probably have used different FitBit products. If only male users had joined, findings might be useless for Bellabeat which only sells products for female customers. Which instructions have the participants received? Did the temperature/weather during the survey have an impact on the user's activity? From which geographical areas have participants been recruited? How well did the participants comply with the instructions of the principal? \n\nDue to the following reasons, we whould interpret the data with huge **caution**:\n* Lack of transparency in terms of data collection\n* Outdated data (the survey was in 2016) might be the wrong choice for developing a new product in 2021\n* Sample size: Only 33 users and short observation period of one (Möbius dataset) respectively two months only (original dataset)\n \nThe **data integrity** is clearly not sufficient to provide reliable insights to Bellabeat. The following analysis therefore can only offer first hints and directions which should be verified through analysis of a larger and more reliable dataset.\n\n## Description of Möbius dataset\n\nThe dataset contains personal tracker data of 30 Fitbit users (the later analysis will show that the dataset actually contains 33 users). Due to anonymized IDs the data cannot be associated with the real username anymore and therefore protects the privacy of the users.\n\nThe dataset consists of 18 csv files organized in long data format which means the each row is one observation per user. Most users have data in multiple rows. \n\nMöbius offers a preprocessed dataset. The previous manipulations are, however, not transparent.\n\n## Research questions\n\nIn order to have an initial direction for the analysis, I would like to verify the following hypotheses:\n* People exercise more often at the weekend.\n* People mostly exercise after work.\n* People who sleep less than 6 hours tend to exercise less than the average.\n* Exercise correlates with a reduced time to fall asleep.\n* People are lazy in terms of manually adjusting or inputting information.\n* People who perform more high-intensity workouts (MET>6) burn more calories in average\n* Many people don't wear the device at night (due to charging, discomfort, etc.)\n\nMore insights should be discovered by detecting outliers, analyzing relationships among different features, etc.\n\n## Selected Data\n\nI have decided to focus on the following files during my analysis: \n* daily_activity which already combines data from various other files\n* hourly_calories\n* sleep_day \n* weight_log_info\n\nLet's load the libraries and csv files to have a first look at it.\n\n## Data cleaning and analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#load libraries\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.108308Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.10877Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.13372Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.108734Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.132745Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's load a few relevant files which might be related to Bellabeat's wellness watch and have a first look at the daily_activity dataframe.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity = pd.read_csv('../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv')\nweight_info = pd.read_csv('../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv')\nsleep_day = pd.read_csv('../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv')\nhourly_calories = pd.read_csv('../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.135196Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.135506Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.196355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.135469Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.195153Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Daily Activity\n\nLet's start the analysis with the daily_activity csv file.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.198923Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.199228Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.225192Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.199196Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T20:34:11.223904Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Units\n\nUnfortunately we don't know whether the distance is measured in km or miles which is affected by the device settings.

Algorithms allow today to automatically detect activites (such as running, swimming, cycling).\n* Instead of manual input, additional user information could be automatically detected by face recognition in the Bellabeat app if the user consent has been obtained, e.g. detect gender, age, BMI based on camera, similar as Anura app)\n* Reminders on the phone, participation in competitions (social) or goal-setting could help increase the user's engagement\n* Due to the very small screen of the wearable, the user faces difficulties to navigate through the settings,therefore user experience is key --> automation and accessibility for users with bad eyes, etc. should be ensured (bigger fonts, simplified menu, enlarged icons, etc.)\n* It seems there were some technical issues indicated by the data (low number of steps on certain days, sedentarydistance, body fat, etc.).

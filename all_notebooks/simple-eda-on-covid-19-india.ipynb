Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. \n### The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. \n### The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).\n### At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing all necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Data "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_excel(\"../input/Covid_19_India_latest_update.xlsx\").rename(columns = {\"Name of State/UT\": \"States\"})\ndf.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Simple EDA\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set the width and height of the figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,7))\n\n# Add title\nplt.title(\"Total confirmed cases\")\n\n# Bar chart showing Total confirmed cases according to states\nsns.barplot(x=df['States'], y=df['Total Cases'])\n\n# Add label for vertical axis\nplt.ylabel(\"confirmed cases\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set the width and height of the figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n\n# Add title\nplt.title(\"Total number of cases recovered\")\n\n# Bar chart showing No of confirmed cases recovered according to states\nsns.barplot(x=df['States'], y=df['Recovered'])\n\n# Add label for vertical axis\nplt.ylabel(\"No of cases recovered\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set the width and height of the figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n\n# Add title\nplt.title(\"Total number of deaths\")\n\n# Bar chart showing No number of deaths\nsns.barplot(x=df['States'], y=df['Deaths'])\n\n# Add label for vertical axis\nplt.ylabel(\"No of Deaths\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set the width and height of the figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\n\n# Add title\nplt.title(\"Total number of cases today\")\n\n# Bar chart showing No number of deaths\nsns.barplot(x=df['States'], y=df['Cases Today'])\n\n# Add label for vertical axis\nplt.ylabel(\"No of cases today\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

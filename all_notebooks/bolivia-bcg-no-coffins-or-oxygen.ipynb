Families don't want to deal with the fact that this has exploded. We're doing what we can.\"\nWith hospitals running out of oxygen supplies, relatives of patients were told to make their own arrangements. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/coffins-oxygen-bolivia-struggling-coronavirus-surge-200724081503555.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns #visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRJxaBu7NaUegIHtzJRhsFJx2j3PvbI7LMhqg&usqp=CAU)m.facebook.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Polls deferred again\n\nWith the peak of the pandemic expected later this month, the electoral tribunal on Thursday postponed general elections, scheduled for September, until October 18.\n\nThe election was originally supposed to be held in May but had been rescheduled to September 6 after the country went into lockdown following the virus outbreak.\n\nThe latest postponement comes just two weeks after interim President Jeanine Anez, who has been leading the country following Evo Morales's controversial departure last year, tested positive for COVID-19.

There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.\n\n\n## 2. Our Goal\n\nThe main aim is to help the medical researchers find the related articles for covid 19 for each set of task mentioned below:\n\n1. What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\n2. What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n3. What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?\n4. What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\n5. What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?\n6. What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance?\n7. What has been published about medical care?\n8. What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?\n9. What has been published about ethical and social science considerations?\n\n\n## 3. Our approach\n\nWe have taken three basic approaches to find the related articles.\n\n1. Text preprocessing of the dataset using NLP, regular expressions and gensim\n2. Word embedding of the texts using doc2vec and finding the similarity scores between the tasks and the articles using nearest neighbouring KD tree algorithm.\n3. Document clustering using K means model and labelled the cluster to the respective tasks.\n4. Using BM25 ranking algorithm to find the most relevant articles for each tasks.\n\n\n## 4. Table of Contents\n\n1. Reading the matadata\n2. Loading the json files\n3. Dataframe creation of the json files\n4. Text Preprocessing \n5. Data Visualization\n6. Doc2vec with K means clustering and DBow method\n7. Doc2vec with nearest neighbor kd tree algorithm and DM method\n8. BM25 ranking algorithm"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Step 1 : Reading the matadata and converting the json files into a dataframe for analysis"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### importing the libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport glob\nimport json\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('ggplot')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## reading the matadata information\nroot_path = '/kaggle/input/CORD-19-research-challenge/'\nmetadata_path = f'{root_path}/metadata.csv'\ncovid_data = pd.read_csv(metadata_path, dtype={\n    'pubmed_id': str,\n    'Microsoft Academic Paper ID': str, \n    'doi': str\n})\ncovid_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###  Step2 : Loading the json files using glob function and a Filereader class"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### loading  all the json files\nall_json = glob.glob(f'{root_path}/**/*.json', recursive=True)\nlen(all_json)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## helper class to read the json files\nclass FileReader:\n    def __init__(self,filepath):\n        with open(filepath) as file:\n            content = json.load(file)\n            self.paper_id = content['paper_id']\n            self.abstract = []\n            self.body_text = []\n            \n            # extract abstract\n            for i in content['abstract']:\n                self.abstract.append(i['text'])\n                \n            # extract body text\n            for i in content['body_text']:\n                self.body_text.append(i['text'])\n                \n            self.abstract = '\\n'.join(self.abstract)\n            self.body_text = '\\n'.join(self.body_text)\n            \n            def __repr__(self):\n                return f'{self.paper_id}: {self.abstract[:200]}... {self.body_text[:200]}...'\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Helper function adds break after every words when character length reach to certain amount.

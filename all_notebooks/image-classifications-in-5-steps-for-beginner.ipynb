Create and train a model\n\n* We now use a pre-trained ResNet18 Convolutional Neural Net model, and use transfer learning to learn weights of only the last layer of the network.\n\n* Why Transfer learning? Because with transfer learning, you begin with an existing (trained) neural network used for image recognition — and then tweak it a bit (or more) here and there to train a model for your particular use case. And why do we do that? Training a reasonable neural network would mean needing approximately 300,000 image samples, and to achieve really good performance, we’re going to need at least a million images.\n\n* In our case, we have approximately 2500 images in our training set — you have one guess to decide if that would have been enough if were to train a neural net from scratch.\n\n* We use the **create_cnn()** function for loading a pre-trained ResNet18 network, that was trained on around a million images from the ImageNet database.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.

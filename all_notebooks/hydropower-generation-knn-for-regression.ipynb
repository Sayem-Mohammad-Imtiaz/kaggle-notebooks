Introduction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For forecasting, historical data is used as input and future trends are predicted on the basis of this data, but accurate selection and extraction of meaningful features from data are challenging. However, the *k*nn algorithm, one of the most simple and useful Machine Learning techniques, can be easily used to generate powerful regression models. In this notebook, I focused on the use of kNN itself and its hyperparametrizations, to guarantee a better understanding of this algorithm and keep it as a plain tutorial to anyone who needs it. Another resources like feature engineering, dimensionality reduction or even another machine learning techniques are not used.\n\nThe dataset used is a energy generation compilation of several european countries, measured in THh between 2000 and 2019.

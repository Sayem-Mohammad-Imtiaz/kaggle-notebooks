Roughly, we will be following the below structure: \n\n* Load the data.\n* Display useful statistics.\n* Build generic functions to detect nulls and missing values.\n* Handle missing values.\n* Make Visualizations to understand data better.\n\nThe problem comes under classification as we are predicting a binary value of either promoted (1) or not (0). After going through the above listed steps one can efficiently build ML models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forests to name a few.

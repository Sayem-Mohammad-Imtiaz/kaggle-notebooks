They also consume more fuel and adds to the weight of the car which means the gas mileage is reduced as a result of this. However they offer more acceleration than relatively smaller engines. \n\n- Smaller Engines on the other hand consume lesser fuel and offer better gas mileage but lesser acceleration. It is important to note that the advent of turbocharged engines has made smaller engines more powerful than some larger ones.\n\n- Our expectation as in line with reality is that engines with larger size should be rather more expensive than smaller ones.

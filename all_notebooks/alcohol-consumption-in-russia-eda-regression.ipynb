Pint of beer is ususally a manageable amount for for a healthy adult to drink because a typical beer is composed of 5~10% of alcohol. \n\nHowever, if you were offered a pint of vodka to drink, it would be much less manageable and probably dangerous. Typical vodka is composed of 40% alcohol and your body can only handle so much alcohol at once.\n\nIn a similar train of thought, in order for us to analyze the level of consumption capacity of alcoholic beverages of varying strength, we would have to put them in an equal scale, alcohol by volume.\n\nQuick goole search reveals that average alcohol content per beverage are: (citations needed)\n- Wine : 11.6% \n    - Source : https://www.masterclass.com/articles/learn-about-alcohol-content-in-wine-highest-to-lowest-abv-wines#:~:text=ABV%20is%20the%20global%20standard,with%20an%20average%20of%2018%25.\n- Beer : 5%\n    - Source : https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink#:~:text=That's%20why%20it's%20important%20to,is%20usually%20about%205%25%20alcohol\n- Vodka : 40%\n    - Source : https://www.alcoholrehabguide.org/alcohol/types/#:~:text=Vodka,ABV%20in%20the%20United%20States.\n- Champagne : 12%\n    - Source : https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/31/14135404/champagne-sparkling-wine-science-bubbles-physics-alcohol-hangovers-new-years\n- Brandy : 47.5% (midpoint of 30% ~ 60%)\n    - Source : https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/31/14135404/champagne-sparkling-wine-science-bubbles-physics-alcohol-hangovers-new-years\n    \nThey are by no means exact numbers, but these values are good starting point for us to make the analysis ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a scaled dataframe that contains the regional sales of alcohol volume per year per capita by beverage type\nalc_type = pd.Series(['wine', 'beer', 'vodka', 'champagne', 'brandy'])\nabv = pd.Series([0.116, 0.05, 0.4, 0.12, 0.475])\nscale = pd.concat([alc_type, abv], keys=['type', 'abv'], axis = 1).set_index('type')\n\nalc_scaled = pd.DataFrame()\nalc_scaled['year'] = alc_clean['year']\nalc_scaled['region'] = alc_clean['region']\n\nfor alc in alc_type: \n    alc_scaled[alc] = alc_clean[alc] * scale.loc[alc, 'abv']\n\nalc_scaled.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# map the yearly trend of alcoholic beverage sales scaled by alcohol volume\nalc_scaled_tidy = pd.melt(alc_scaled, \\\n                          id_vars = ['year', 'region'], \\\n                          value_vars=['wine', 'beer','vodka','champagne','brandy'],\\\n                         var_name = 'type')\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,6))\nplt.xticks(np.arange(1998, 2017))\nsns.lineplot(x='year', y='value', hue='type', data=alc_scaled_tidy)\nplt.title('Average regional sales of alcoholic beverages in alcohol volume from 1998 to 2016')\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Liters per year per capita')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Takeaway:\n\n- Fall of vodka sales average coincides the rise of beer sales \n- While I cannot conclusively say that vodka or beer is the most popular among regions in Russia, we can see that they are very close.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Bootstrap sampling***\n\nHow can we verify that that vodka is still the most popular alcoholic beverage in terms of regional averages?\nThis can be done by a quick statistical simulation, where we try to 're-create' iterations of vodka and champagne regional sales data and calculate the proportion of times in which the vodka sales average was higher than that of beer.

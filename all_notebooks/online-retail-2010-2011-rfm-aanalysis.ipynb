determined.\n\n1. Cant Loose Them: This group consists of 81 customers. The Recency average is 141, the Frequency average is 184, and the Monetary average is 2346.\n\n2. Horse Risk: This group consists of 577 customers. Recency averages are 164, Frequency averages are 57, and Monetary averages are 950.\n\n3. Need Attention: This group consists of 208 customers. Recency averages are 50, Frequency averages are 42, Monetary averages are 833.\n\nYorumlar\n\nThe most risky and potentially focused customers on this table are the \"Can't Loose Them\" class. This class is the most valuable customer class in this table. Recency value is low, but it is the highest when looking at Frequence. In other words, this customer is the class with the highest potential to leave us. Considering all customer classes, Monetary is one of the customers with the highest value, but this group of customers has not recently exchanged. He approached leaving our company. This is the most important customer class for our company.\n\nA class that should not be lost is the \"Horse Risk\" group of customers. This group is also one of the highest classes in Frequency. It also attracts attention as it is the third-class customer group that is the most customer. Recency value of this group is low. This is an indication that this group has not been shopping recently. It is necessary to bring these customers back to the company.\n\nIn the \"Need Attention\" class, frequency and recency values ​​are an average customer group. This customer group is also a class that needs attention because it has the potential to shift to both regions. As an action suggestion, if supported by promotions, discounts and loyalty to the company, this customer group can be shifted towards loyal customers or potential loyal customers. However, as a result of such action attempts, they may also shift to the \"horse risk\" group or they may also be included in the \"about to sleep\" class.\n\nAs actions to be taken for these groups, their loyalty should be increased through promotions, discounts and special team campaigns. Special activities should be carried out for these customer groups. Actions to be taken for these groups will provide higher efficiency compared to other customer classes. For this reason, information about these 3 customer groups should be extracted and this customer information should be shared with the business intelligence department. These departments, which have a business intelligence department, should be directed to departments such as purchasing and marketing by removing the contact information of these customers and they should mobilize these customers regarding their own business areas.\n\nBelow, information about the \"Need Attention\" customer group has been extracted as \"new_customers.csv\" file.

With such advancements, automation of all the tough methods from yesteryear began to occur. \nInstead of writing a hashed out algorithm in C++, a data science pracitioner only had to call a wrapper for the model to run. It certainly has made life easy for a lot of people in the last couple of years. It did the same for me. \n\nA popular saying goes along the lines of, _The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity._\n\nI was stuck with the same mindset. Calling .fit on a model did run perfectly, but how did it actually run? \n\nAfter a lot of careful pondering over that question, I dredged up the trusty ol' internet and began studying on how the actually worked. \n\nThis series, a from scratch series, is meant to implement all the popular machine learning algorithms from scratch based on their mathematics principle. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Contents: \n1.

Let's try to be as silly as possible for this. \n- Height (X)\n- Income (Y)\n\nWe are holding an assumption that the data is continuous, i.e, scales up in a specific order as:\n- 100, 200, 300.....\n\nSince both height and income can follow this pattern, this would be a satisfactory dataset. \n\nOur aim, with linear regression, is to find relations between the two datasets. Our entire approach revolves around the question:\n- Is income related to the height of the person? \n- Do taller people earn more? \n- If it really does, can we predict it? \n\nConsidering our dataset for a 1000 people, our dataset would consist of these datapoints: \n- 145 cm, 51000 USD\n- 184 cm, 62000 USD\n- 152 cm, 59000 USD\n\nAnd so on. \n\nLinear regression lets us do some math on these data points and describes the correlation between these datasets. That is, how strongly does height really relate with high income.\n\nSince correlation, in this example, has a range 0f 0-1, the correlation would confirm the following hypothesis: \n- A correlation of 1 would mean being tall always means you have a higher income.\n\n- A correlation of 0 would mean there is no relationship between height and income.\n\n- A negative value means a negative correlation, that is, taller people tend to have lower incomes. A correlation of -1 would mean taller people always make less money than shorter people.\n\n\nThis allows us to understand the relation between two variables, or two types of data. \nAlso, once we have the relation, we can use linear regression for prediction. If we know the rough relationship between X and Y, then we can use this relationship to predict values of Y for a value of X we want.\n\nFor this example, it would be: prediciting income for the height of the person\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we head on to the math, let's go through the regular steps:\n- Brief Data Outlook\n- EDA\n- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\n- Data Modelling\n- Results and Evaluation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## [Brief Data Outlook]()<a id=\"3\"></a> <br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### [Loading Libraries and Data]()<a id=\"4\"></a> <br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Basic needed libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n#visualization libraries\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n\n#Processing:\nimport calendar","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T23:42:31.450588Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T23:42:31.450961Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.903413Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T23:42:31.45093Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.902381Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# I had noticed that the dataframe had commas for decimal, pandas automatically can handle it during loading with the decimal field. \ndf =  pd.read_csv(\"../input/beer-consumption-sao-paulo/Consumo_cerveja.csv\",  decimal=\",\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.905416Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.905817Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.927998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.905762Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.926741Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### [Understanding Data]()<a id=\"5\"></a> <br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Finding Number of rows and columns\nprint(\"Dataset contains {} rows and {} columns\".format(df.shape[0], df.shape[1]))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.930103Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.930529Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.936262Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.93049Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T23:42:32.935049Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's begin the journey, there seems to be a few features provided for the dataset.

In addition, it also contains information regarding their background such as gender, race, lunch plan, whether or not they completed a test preparation course, and their parent's level of education.\n\nThe notebook will take a look at each factor to see if they play a significant role in a student's academic success in those subjects.

If test prep helps, is the group that has the best score also the group that has the highest test preparation course?\n6. What about whether or not the parents have a degree?\n7. Do low income students (defined by whether or not they are on a lunch plan) score worse?\n8.

For example, on average, a student is expected to do better if they take a test preparation course, if they are on a standard lunch plan, and if their parents have a degree. In addition, the average male performed better than the average female in the math section while the females outperformed the males in the reading and writing sections.\n\nAs for using machine learning to predict scores, the Logistic Regression model was used, and it performed slightly better than just picking the most frequent bin (bin 3). However, bin 3 encompasses a signficant range of scores from D- to almost B- (60-80). Therefore, since the accuracy score only slightly increased, and the score range that the model predicts is significantly wide, the results of the logistic regression model used in this study may not be too useful."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

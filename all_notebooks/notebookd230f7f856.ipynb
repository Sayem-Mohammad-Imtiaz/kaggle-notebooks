I took the names of 7 famous athletes; Nolan Ryan, Greg Maddux, Michael Jordan, Mia Hamm, Ted Williams, Kobe Bryant, Lebron James and tested my hypothesis by looking at the number of babies with the athlete's name during the athlete's rookie year and last active year. The frequency of the baby names had a significant change. There was an increase after the athlete's rookie debut in most of the cases, so my hypothesis was proved correct."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"64c5baa7-54e6-af06-1ff5-6ac92fe1fb94"},"outputs":[],"source":"\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook\nfrom bokeh.palettes import brewer\ncolors = brewer['Spectral'][10]\noutput_notebook()\n\nnational_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/NationalNames.csv\")\nprint(\"Baby names loaded!\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c6eab8c8-75a3-88b9-87fd-141483cd17af"},"outputs":[],"source":"\nathletes = [\n    \n    { 'name': 'Nolan', 'full_name': 'Nolan Ryan', 'rookie_year': 1966, 'retired_year': 1993, 'sex': 'M'},\n    { 'name': 'Maddux', 'full_name': 'Greg Maddux', 'rookie_year': 1986, 'retired_year': 2008, 'sex': 'M' },\n    { 'name': 'Jordan', 'full_name': 'Michael Jordan', 'rookie_year': 1984, 'retired_year': 2003, 'sex': 'M' },\n    { 'name': 'Mia', 'full_name': 'Mia Hamm', 'rookie_year': 1991, 'retired_year': 2004, 'sex': 'F' },\n    { 'name': 'Ted', 'full_name': 'Ted Williams', 'rookie_year': 1939, 'retired_year': 1960, 'sex': 'F' },\n    { 'name': 'Kobe', 'full_name': 'Kobe Bryant', 'rookie_year': 1996, 'retired_year': 2014, 'sex': 'M' },\n    { 'name': 'Lebron', 'full_name': 'Lebron James', 'rookie_year': 2003, 'retired_year': 2014, 'sex': 'M' }    \n]          \n\n\ndef analyze_athlete(i, athlete): \n    \n    name, full_name, rookie_year, retired_year, sex  = athlete['name'], athlete['full_name'], athlete['rookie_year'], athlete['retired_year'], athlete['sex']\n    \n    \n    df = national_data[national_data['Name'] == name ]\n    df = df[df['Gender'] == sex ]\n    \n   \n    career_years = range(rookie_year, retired_year)\n    prior_generation_years = range(rookie_year-25, rookie_year)\n    total_years = range(rookie_year-25, retired_year+25)\n    \n   \n    rookie_name_count = df[df['Year'] == rookie_year]['Count'].sum()\n    retired_name_count = df[df['Year'] == retired_year]['Count'].sum()\n    career_name_count = df[df['Year'].isin(career_years)]['Count'].sum() \n    prior_name_count = df[df['Year'].isin(prior_generation_years)]['Count'].sum() \n    career_name_avg = round(df[df['Year'].isin(career_years)]['Count'].mean(), 2)\n    prior_name_avg = round(df[df['Year'].isin(prior_generation_years)]['Count'].mean(), 2)\n    influence_rate = round(100*(career_name_avg - prior_name_avg) / prior_name_avg, 2)\n    influence_count = int(career_name_count - (prior_name_count*1.10)) # add 10% for approx 25y population growth\n    \n    \n    \n    p = figure(title=(full_name+' Inspired Trends'), x_axis_label='Year', y_axis_label='Count')\n    \n    df = df[df['Year'].isin(total_years)]\n    x = df['Year'].tolist()\n    y = df['Count'].tolist()  \n    \n    p.line(x, y, legend=name, line_width=2, line_color=colors[i], line_cap='round')\n    p.quad(top=[(max(y))], bottom=[0], left=[rookie_year],\n       right=[retired_year], color=\"#B3DE69\", alpha=0.3, legend=\"Active Career\")\n    show(p)\n    \n    \n    \n    print(\"Here's how {0} influenced for the name '{1}':\".format(full_name, name))\n    print(\"{0} babies named {1} were born in {2}, {3}'s rookie year.\".format(rookie_name_count, name, rookie_year, full_name))\n    print(\"{0} babies named {1} were born in {2}, {3}'s last active year.\".format(retired_name_count, name, retired_year, full_name))\n    print(\"On average, {0} babies named {1} were born per year while athlete's career was active.\".format(career_name_avg, name))\n    print(\"Comparatively, babies named {1} averaged {0} in the preceeding generation (25 years).\".format(prior_name_avg, name))\n    print(\"The frequency of babies named {0} changed by {1}% after the athlete's rookie debut.\".format(name, influence_rate))\n    print(\"{0} probably inspired the names of {1} babies.\".format(full_name, influence_count))"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"eeb29761-cbb2-d509-8acb-a8a4b577951a"},"outputs":[],"source":"for i, athlete in enumerate(athletes): \n    analyze_athlete(i, athlete)\n    "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"45464917-beac-2dfe-445e-51ea2d66131d"},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

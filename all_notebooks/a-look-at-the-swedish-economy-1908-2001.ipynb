The reasons behind this precipitious rise cannot be answered by this data. We\ncan, however, see that this rise in prices did not cause a concomitant rise in inflation\nbecause interest rates were increased to record levels approaching 12% on two occasions.\n\nWe also see, despite steady price levels, that there is a period in the 1920s where\ninflation reached 50% and interest rates were fairly high at 7%. This could be an \nindication of stagflation in the Swedish economy. We would need employment data and\nbetter knowledge of the Swedish economy in the 1920s to know for sure.\n\nFinally, there are periods, in the 40s, late 50s, where inflation approached 10%\ndespite steady price levels. During this time we also see that interest rates were\nlow. These blips largely disappear and the swings become less pronounced once \ninterest rates start rising again in the early 1960s.

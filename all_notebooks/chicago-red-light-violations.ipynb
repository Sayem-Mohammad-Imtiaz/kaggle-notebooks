In this dataset there are 183 unique intersections and 365 unique camera locations. Many of the intersections have multiple camera locations to capture each approach to the intersection. Because camera locations are not identified by approach, only intersection is used in this analysis. The apparent seasonal trend to the data led me to incorporate NOAA weather data for station id 725300 (Chicago/O'Hare International Airport). The NOAA weather data was pulled from the NOAA GSOD public Big Query dataset.</p>\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [1.

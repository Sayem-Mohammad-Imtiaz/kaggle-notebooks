Later we'll use a 7-day rolling average to smooth things out, but bear these raw numbers in mind. The COVID Tracking Project's [data page](https://covidtracking.com/data) explains many of the specific events or data issues, by state. Some spikes indicate real changes in testing capacity, such as the spike in New Jersey's numbers on May 15th, which reflects [their limited intiative to test all residents](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/health/2020/05/15/coronavirus-nj-middlesex-county-begin-testing-asymptomatic/5197296002/) including those who show no symptoms of COVID.\n\nNotice that some states have a very small gap between the number of total tests conducted and the number of positive tests.

Are we doing enough testing to give a reasonably accurate picture of how COVID is spreading? One way to answer this is to examine the \"test-positivity rate\".\n\nThe daily test-positivity rate is defined as: \n\\begin{equation}\ndaily\\:test-positivity\\:rate = \\frac{number\\:of\\:daily\\:new\\:infections}{number\\:of\\:daily\\:new\\:tests}\n\\end{equation}\n\nFrom [this article in the Atlantic on the utility of test-positivity rates](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/04/us-coronavirus-outbreak-out-control-test-positivity-rate/610132/), \"\\[the\\] high test-positivity rate almost certainly means that the U.S. is not testing everyone who has been infected with the pathogen, because it implies that doctors are testing only people with a very high probability of having the infection. People with milder symptoms, to say nothing of those with none at all, are going undercounted. Countries that test broadly should encounter far more people who are not infected than people who are, so their test-positivity rate should be lower.\" For example, South Korea is often cited as the example of effective pandemic control through mass testing. Their positive test rate was between 2-3% of all tests; Canada, Germany and Denmark have positivity rates of 6-8%; Australia and New Zealand have 2% positivity rates. As of May 17th, the US was down to a 5% test-positive rate overall.\n\nThe article also notes that comparing test-positivity rates between different regions may be fraught since not all populations may show equal [incidence](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section2.html) of COVID-19, and the test-positivity numbers themselves come with a lot of caveats (we don't know exactly who is getting tested and how reliabile the tests are). However, \"\\[the test-positivity rate\\] can still give a rough sense of how bad a particular outbreak is by distinguishing between places undergoing very different sizes of epidemics, Andrews said. A country with a 25 percent positivity rate and one with a 2 percent positivity rate are facing “vastly different epidemics,” he said, and the 2 percent country is better off.\n\nLet's look at the test-positive rates in each state. We'll also apply a 7-day moving average to the number of daily tests. Generally, we should expect to see two lines with opposite slopes that cross somewhere in the middle -- as testing capacity increases, test-positivity rates should decrease if the virus is spreading only steadily or declining. Most states show this pattern, which is good news. States that might still be experiencing exponential growth might have an increase in testing with a corresponding increase in test-positivity rate -- for example, Ohio, Wyoming, Minnesota.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate test-positive rates per state\nus=us.assign(daily_rate=(us.daily_positive/us.daily_tested)*100)\nus.daily_rate.replace(us[us.daily_rate<0].daily_rate, 0, inplace=True)\nus['daily_rate'].clip(lower=0)\nus.daily_rate.fillna(0, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axs = plt.subplots(9,6,sharey=True,gridspec_kw={'hspace': 0.4, 'wspace': 0.4},figsize=(20, 25))\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(fig.axes):\n    if i>50:\n        ax.set_visible(False)\n    else:\n        state = us[us.Province_State==raw_states[i]]\n        short_dates = []\n        for j in range(0,state.Date.values.size):\n            short_dates.append(state.Date.values[j].replace('2020-',''))\n        daily_tested_rolling = state.daily_tested.rolling(window=7).mean()\n        daily_rate_rolling = state.daily_rate.rolling(window=7).mean()\n        ax.plot(short_dates, daily_rate_rolling,'-', color='tab:orange')\n        \n        ax2 = ax.twinx()\n        ax2.plot(short_dates, daily_tested_rolling,'-')\n        ax2.yaxis.set_major_locator(plticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=5))\n        ax.set_title(raw_states[i])\n        #ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\n        if i!=0:\n            ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\n        else:\n            #for tick in ax.get_xticklabels():\n            #    tick.set_rotation(90)\n            loc = plticker.MultipleLocator(base=20.0)\n            ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(loc)\n\nfig.suptitle('Daily Test-Positivity Rate (orange) and Total Tests (blue) By State (Rolling)')\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at tests per capita, using population estimates for each state from [the US Census Bureau National Population Totals](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html).\n\nThe good news is, as noted on [this Johns Hopkins page using COVID Tracking Project data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/testing-positivity), most states are below the WHO recommended 12% test-positivity threshold to reopen.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Add population data for per capita testing\npopdata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nstest2019alldata/nst-est2019-alldata.csv', delimiter=',')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate rolling test-positive rates per state\nus=us.assign(daily_rate=(us.daily_positive/us.daily_tested)*100)\nus.daily_rate.replace(us[us.daily_rate<0].daily_rate, 0, inplace=True)\nus['daily_rate'].clip(lower=0)\nus.daily_rate.fillna(0, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, axs = plt.subplots(9,6,gridspec_kw={'hspace': 0.4, 'wspace': 0.3},figsize=(20, 20),sharey=True)\n#fig, axs = plt.subplots(7,8,gridspec_kw={'hspace': 0.4, 'wspace': 0.3},figsize=(30, 20),sharey=True)\n#fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,6,gridspec_kw={'hspace': 0.4, 'wspace': 0.3},figsize=(20, 5),sharey=True)\nall_tests_per_capita = pd.DataFrame()\n\nfor i, ax in enumerate(fig.axes):\n    # Hide blank plots since 51 doesn't divide evenly into full rows\n    if i>50:\n        ax.set_visible(False)\n    else:\n        state_name = raw_states[i]\n        state = us[us.Province_State==state_name]\n        #short_dates = []\n        #for j in range(0,state.Date.values.size):\n        #    short_dates.append(state.Date.values[j].replace('2020-',''))\n        short_dates = state.Date.str.replace('2020-','')\n        daily_tested_rolling = state.daily_tested.rolling(window=7).mean()\n        pop = popdata[popdata.NAME==state_name].POPESTIMATE2019.values[0]\n        tests_per_capita = pd.Series(daily_tested_rolling.divide(pop)*100000,name=state_name)\n        tests_per_capita.index=state.Date # Set index to dates;

I will use the Pandas techniques to shape the data and use visualization tools to represent the data.\n\n\n**Context**\n\nAirbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary accommodation provider. Since its beginning in 2008, Airbnb has seen enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website growing each year exponentially.\n\nSeattle is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States. It is the seat of King County, Washington. With a 2019 population of 753,675, it is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America.\n\n**Why this dataset**\n\nThis dataset is interesting to me because I wonder what the relationship is between the number of different Airbnb room types and the locations. In particular, this notebook will attempt to explore the following questions.\n\n- What are the top locations and their listing prices among all listings? \n- What are the top room types and their listing prices among all listings?\n- What are the respective mean prices for the most popolar room type and in the most popular location? \n\nTo this end, I will focus on analyzing **neighbourhood_group_cleansed** , **property_type**, **room_type**, **price**.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import all necessary modules and initialize the plot style.\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\nstyle.use('ggplot')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data import, a first look and clean-up\n\nThe dataset is compiled in a CSV file and let us import it and take a look at its raw form.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"listing = pd.read_csv('../input/airbnb-seattle-listings-data/airbnb_seattle_listings_data.csv')\ndisplay(listing)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset consists of data scraped on a few different days, and let us focus on the snapshot on March 19.

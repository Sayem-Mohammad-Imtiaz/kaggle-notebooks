BoaC is a language and an infrastructure for deeper analysis of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). BoaC is a Hadoop based infrastructure that analyzes different parts of each paper and returns the desired result based on the queries by the users. These queries can either be written by users who are familiar with the BoaC language or can search keywords in different parts of the paper or in the finding section of the papers.\n\n#### What makes this Boa-based tool better, or faster or easier than other things that are already available?\nWhile a tool doesn't currently exist that can perform a deeper analysis of COVID-19 papers without requiring any installation that is desirable for this use case, search over papers have been explored in theory. Current search tools will add the text from papers into a bag of words, and enable search over that bag, our approach will preserve the structure of the paper and thus the context in which that word appears.  For instance, a word appearing in the methodology section of a paper may not be relevant if the question is phrased as \"what do we know?\". On the other hand, a word appearing in the methodology section of a paper would be a great fit if the question is phrased as \"which other work has used the method X?\" Therefore, more accurate results will be produced, which will reduce the time it will take for experts to shift through papers to hone in on relevant findings.\n\n#### Findings related to the hydroxychloroquine\nTo obtain findings related to the usage of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of the coronavirus family, we used the keywords \"hydroxychloroquine\" and \"treatment\" and searched in the findings of the papers. A result of the search can be found [here](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/boac/?q=boa/result/public/375). A few examples of the results are shown below,\n\n**Paper 1:** Franck Touret and Xavier De Lamballerie. 2019. Commentary Of chloroquine and COVID-19. Antiviral Research. [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104762)\n\n**Paragraph 1:** The sulfate and phosphate salts of chloroquine have both been commercialised as antimalarial drugs. Hydroxychloroquine has also been used as an antimalarial, but in addition is now broadly used in autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Of note, chloroquine and <font color='red'>hydroxychloroquine</font> are considered to be safe and side-effects are generally mild and transitory. However, the margin between the therapeutic and toxic dose is narrow and chloroquine poisoning has been associated with cardiovascular disorders that can be life-threatening (Frisk-Holmberg et al., 1983) . Chloroquine and <font color='red'>hydroxychloroquine</font> use should therefore be subject to strict rules, and self-<font color='red'>treatment</font> is not recommended.\n\n**Paragraph 2:** This would represent the first successful use of chloroquine in humans for the <font color='red'>treatment</font> of an acute viral disease, and is undoubtedly excellent news, since this drug is cheap and widely available. However, it should be considered carefully before drawing definitive conclusions, since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement. Results were produced in ten different hospitals and possibly from a number of different clinical protocols among those listed above, which include various designs for control groups (none, different antivirals, placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The final interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of published data, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion. It will be of the utmost importance to know if the observed efficacy is associated specifically with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts (e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and <font color='red'>hydroxychloroquine</font>. It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.\n\n**Paper 2:** 2019. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105923) [[PubMed]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32070753)\n\n**Paragraph 1:** At the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus epidemic [6] in 2003, several molecules were tested to assess their effectiveness against this virus. Among these, teicoplanin [7] , an antistaphylococcal agent, had proven efficacy in vitro , and this was also the case for chloroquine, at a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of approximatively 8 ?M, and when added to the cell culture either before of after exposure to the virus [5 , 8-10] . These findings ended up being forgotten because of the disappearance of SARS for reasons that are neither clear nor explained [11] . The novel coronavirus currently isolated in China has been, with staggering speed, evaluated regarding its sensitivity to already used drugs [12] . Thus, the new antiviral drug remdesivir [13] as well as chloroquine, at an EC 50 of 1.1 ?M, were found to be effective in preventing replication of this virus [12] . Chloroquine is perhaps one of the most prescribed drugs in the world [14 , 15] . As a matter of fact, all Europeans visiting malaria-endemic geographic areas for decades received chloroquine prophylaxis and continued it for 2 months after their return. In addition, local residents took chloroquine continuously, and <font color='red'>treatment</font> of malaria has long been based on this drug. In addition, <font color='red'>hydroxychloroquine</font> has been used for decades at much higher doses (up to 600 mg/day) to treat autoimmune diseases [16] . It is difficult to find a product that currently has a better established safety profile than chloroquine. Furthermore, its cost is negligible. Hence, its possible use both in prophylaxis in people exposed to the novel coronavirus and as a curative <font color='red'>treatment</font> will probably be promptly evaluated by our Chinese colleagues. If clinical data confirm the biological results, the novel coronavirus-associated disease will have become one of the simplest and cheapest to treat and prevent among infectious respiratory diseases.\n\n**Paper 3**: Jean-Marc Rolain, Philippe Colson, and Didier Raoult. 2006. Recycling of chloroquine and its hydroxyl analogue to face bacterial, fungal and viral infections in the 21st century. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents. [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.05.015)[[PubMed]]()\n\n**Paragraph 1:** Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue <font color='red'>hydroxychloroquine</font> (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long use as antimalarial agents. Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference <font color='red'>treatment</font> for chronic Q fever. There is also strong evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting way to treat HIV infection. In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.\n\n\nThese results suggest there has been work associated with this particular drug, and the key findings obtained from the prior drug can help researchers understand various aspects of this drug in treating not only COVID-19 but also other diseases caused by different members of the coronavirus family.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Hence the most popular mode would either be in store or via the web.\n\nPreviously, we have seen that our average consumer is 40-50 years old. Hence it is normal to expect that this customer segment is not reliant on the internet for shopping. This can be seen through the above graph, as the maximum number of purchases are made in store."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_children = df2[['Kidhome','Teenhome','NumWebPurchases','NumWebVisitsMonth','NumStorePurchases','NumCatalogPurchases']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(df_children.corr(), cmap='magma')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_kidhome = df_children.groupby('Kidhome').sum()\n\ndf_kidhome","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_teenhome = df_children.groupby('Teenhome').sum()\n\ndf_teenhome","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_kidhome.plot(kind='bar')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we can see that, when people have children, all kinds of purchases are reduced.

We deemed it fit to drop the rows containing null values and outliers, as they only formed a small fraction of the total data.\n\nThe income field was stored as a text value. We successfully converted cleaned the unnecessary characters like \\\\$ sign and commas to produce a cleaned float value.\n\nWe engineered the total purchases column as well as the Age column from the data provided.\n\nWe noticed anomalies as well as certain patterns in data. Anomalies were mostly handled by dropping the anomalous records as they comprised only a small fraction of the complete dataset."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 2: Statistical Analysis\n\nThe number of store purchases is lightly related to the number of children in the house. If a customer has kids, their overall spending is reduced, which also reduces the number of store purchases. If there are teens in the house, the number of store purchases are reduced slightly. Other factors which is strongly related is the Income. Higher income customers have higher spending power, which can be seen through more amount spent on products from different categories.\n\nWe saw that almost half of our customer base was from Spain, while the remaining small portion was from South Africa and Canada and other countries.\n\nWe observed that people purchase products through stores regardless of their purchases on Gold Products.\n\nWe also observed that being married or having a PhD has no relation with the customer's spending on Fish Products. The factors that are actually somewhat related to spending on fish products are the customer's income and whether they are vegetarian. This is because people who spend on meat/fish are likely to also spend on the other. Whereas people who do not consume meat of any form will not consume fish either and vice versa.\n\nFinally we learnt that geographical reason does matter when it comes to success of a campaign. Since half of our customer base is form Spain, all of the campaigns have been exceedingly popular in Spain while not having as much of an impact in the other countries."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Section 03: Data Visualization\n\nThe latest/ most recent campaign was the most successful campaign so far. \n\nOur average consumer is 40-50 years old, married with 1 kid/teen. They're a graduate and earn between 20 thousand to 80 thousand dollars. They live in Spain.\n\nIf success is to be measured by the amount spent on a certain category of a product then Wine has been the most successful product follwed by Meat products.\n\nPeople do not use Catalogue for purchasing products as much and hence Catalogue channel is unsuccessful as compared to stores or Web purchases."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Advice to the CMO\n\nBased on the profile of our Average customer and their purchasing habits, it is advisable to pay more attention to the web as the most amount of purchases were made in through the web. This is also better going forward as newer generations will be more reliant on technology. It was observed that the category of people with a teen in their home had higher number of purchases through the web in total.\n\nSince most of our Customers are from spain, it might be advisable to develop new marketing strategies that will appeal to the English speaking locals from Canada or South Africa as they are the next most dominant category.\n\nThe recent campaign was the most successful campaign, so it's formula can be repeated with minor variations to hopefully obtain similar results in the future."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

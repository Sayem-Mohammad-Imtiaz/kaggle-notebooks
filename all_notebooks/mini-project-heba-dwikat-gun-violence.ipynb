I became aware of the possibility of active shootings in any public place, by taking a look at the gun violence data, it is my hope to better educate ourselves and others about common questions about these horrific incidents. The significance of researching gun violence is that it can help shed some light on our pre-existing domain knowledge of gun violence in America. Apart from that, it can help determine other insightful information such as the highest percentage of gun violence based on location.\n\nIn this Kernel I will be exploring four datasets : 1- US Mass shooting (2018-2020) 2- Gun violence (2012 - 2014) 3- Persons granted U.S. legal permanent resident status during a given fiscal year  4- a gun violence dataset from kaggle (2013-2018). \n\n\nMy previous questions : \n\n1. How much gun violence is there in the U.S from the overall mortality rate?\n1. do gender and age correlate to gun violence? is there any correlation between race, age , gender?\n1. which states experience the most gun violence?   over the years, did gun violence went up or down?\n\nDue to the difficulty of locating datasets that included mortality rates and fatality incidents, I thought I can change the question to correlation between immigration and gun violence.\n\n\n**Instead ,My research questions will focus on the following:**\n\n1. Is there any correlation between immigration to the U.S and gun violence between the years 2013 - 2018?\n1. Which states experienced the most mass shootings over the past two years ?\n1. who are the suspect demographics of gun violence between 2012-2014? What about race? sex and intent?\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Data Profile**\n\nThe Datasets I will be working with today are the following:\n\n1. gun-violence-data_01-2013_03-2018.csv - The CSV file contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 and March 2018, this dataset is avaliable kaggle, and was originally downloaded from gunviolencearchive.org.\n1. MPI-Data-Hub_USImmigFlow_since1820_2018.csv - the original source for the data was from Migration Policy Institute tabulations of U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Office of Immigration Statistics, Yearbook of Immigration Statistics (various years)\nLink :https://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/charts/Annual-Number-of-US-Legal-Permanent-Residents\n1. Mass Shooting 2018 - US states.csv - This CSV file was obtained from gunviolencearchive.org , this data include mass shootings that happened in 43 states over the last two years, the definition of mass shooting in this data seems to be if number of killed and injured is above four.Gun Violence Archive (GVA) is a not for profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. \nLink : https://www.gunviolencearchive.\n1. full_data.csv - This data was obtained from data.world , the dataset is by Alex Zelenak in which it contains the gun violence incidens between 2012 -2014, the dataset doesnt include the number of people killed , however it includes the intent of killing.\nLink:https://data.world/azel/gun-deaths-in-america\n\n\n\n\n**Prior Work**\nsome prior work includes a report done by the U.S department of Justice that describes homicide trends and patterns in the united states from 1998 through 2008. This links directly to my research as it provides trends based on sex, race age and type of homicides.

It would be beneficial to build on the understanding of their hypothesis testing  and their statistical method to tackle it.\n\nSchnapp, P. (2015).

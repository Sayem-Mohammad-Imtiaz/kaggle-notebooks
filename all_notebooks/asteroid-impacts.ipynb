The equation F=ma \n#(F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration) could be used to estimate the force \n#an asteroid impact would have. Unfortunately, determining the rate of acceleration \n#(deceleration in this case) an asteroid would have when it impacted the earth is \n#difficult to estimate, let alone compute. An equation that is related to F=ma is \n#momentum, p=mv (p is momentum, m is mass, and v is velocity). Momentum is the force \n#an object has when it is moving. In addition, Newtons third law of motion states \n#that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When an object \n#strikes another, the object that was struck imposes an equal and opposite force on \n#the striking object. The momentum of an asteroid could be used as an indicator of \n#the force required to stop it. Before we can calculate an asteroids momentum, we \n#need to first calculate its mass. In order to calculate its mass, we need its volume \n#and density. I will assume the asteroid is spherical for simplicity when calculating \n#volume. I will also assume the worst case scenario for the density of the asteroid. \n#The most dense asteroid discovered has a density of 3.4e+12 kg/km^3 \n#(https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21101-most-pristine-known-asteroid-is-denser-than-granite/).\n#Volume will be m^3.

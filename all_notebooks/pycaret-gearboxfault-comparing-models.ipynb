Most of the information is related to the pre-processing pipeline which is constructed when `setup()` is executed. Be aware of a few important things to note at this stage include:\n\n- **session_id :**  A pseduo-random number distributed as a seed in all functions for later reproducibility. If no `session_id` is passed, a random number is automatically generated that is distributed to all functions. In this experiment, the `session_id` is set as `123` for later reproducibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n- **Target Type :**  Binary or Multiclass. The Target type is automatically detected and shown. There is no difference in how the experiment is performed for Binary or Multiclass problems. All functionalities are identical.<br/>\n<br/>\n- **Label Encoded :**  When the Target variable is of type string (i.e. 'Yes' or 'No') instead of 1 or 0, it automatically encodes the label into 1 and 0 and displays the mapping (0 : No, 1 : Yes) for reference. In this experiment no label encoding is required since the target variable is of type numeric. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Original Data :**  Displays the original shape of the dataset. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Missing Values :**  When there are missing values in the original data this will show as True. For this experiment there are no missing values in the dataset. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Numeric Features :**  The number of features inferred as numeric. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Categorical Features :**  The number of features inferred as categorical. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Transformed Train Set :**  Displays the shape of the transformed training set. <br/>\n<br/>\n- **Transformed Test Set :**  Displays the shape of the transformed test/hold-out set. <br/>\n\nNotice how a few tasks that are imperative to perform modeling are automatically handled such as missing value imputation (in this case there are no missing values in the training data, but we still need imputers for unseen data), categorical encoding etc. Most of the parameters in `setup()` are optional and used for customizing the pre-processing pipeline."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Comparing All Models"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Comparing all models to evaluate performance is the recommended starting point for modeling once the setup is completed (unless you exactly know what kind of model you need, which is often not the case).

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to understand the caribou, their movements must be monitored. Currently, the best way to get this information is through the use of satellite collars. The information collected via the satellite collars helps to broadly monitor the movements of the wide-ranging Beverly and Qamanirjuaq herds. Location data from collared caribou helps biologists keep tabs on the herd’s migration patterns, and helps to show where calving grounds are situated.\n\nAlthough a satellite collaring project has been in place for the Qamanirjuaq caribou since 1993, 2006-2007 was the first year the Beverly herd had been tracked based on telemetry of collared cows.\n\nCurrently, the Government of Nunavut’s Department of Environment (DOE) manages the Qamanirjuaq caribou satellite collaring project. Nunavut DOE staff map the co-ordinates and send updated maps to band offices, hunters and trappers organizations, government departments, and other groups. https://arctic-caribou.com/the-herds/tracking-the-caribou/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSm3PYJadUhCglXTSdW8mVtr0vUwQAsUIGBZg&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"amazing.co.uk","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/caribou-location-tracking/locations.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes from Iván Hernández Cazorla https://www.kaggle.com/ivanhercaz/museums-in-tenerife-location-map","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig_px = px.scatter_mapbox(df, lat=\"latitude\", lon=\"longitude\",\n                           hover_name=\"study_site\",\n                           zoom=11, height=300)\nfig_px.update_layout(mapbox_style=\"open-street-map\",\n                     margin={\"r\":0,\"t\":0,\"l\":0,\"b\":0})\n\nfig_px.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig_px.update_traces(marker={\"size\": [10 for x in df]})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#word cloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator\ntext = \" \".join(str(each) for each in df.season)\n# Create and generate a word cloud image:\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_words=200,colormap='Set3', background_color=\"black\").generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n# Display the generated image:\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='Bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.figure(1,figsize=(12, 12))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#word cloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator\ntext = \" \".join(str(each) for each in df.study_site)\n# Create and generate a word cloud image:\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_words=200,colormap='Set3', background_color=\"black\").generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n# Display the generated image:\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='Bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.figure(1,figsize=(12, 12))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Where are the wolves?

For one, the employee may have a depth of experience and talent that is vital to the company (or a team). In addition, replacing such an employee may be difficult (if not nearly impossible). For another, it takes resources and time to bring on a new employee to 'replace' the talent/expertise/knowledge of the former employee. \n\nWith that being said, this notebook will use employee (attrition) data provided by IBM data scientists. \n\nExploratory data analysis will be performed to look at the data and visualize certain aspects of it. During EDA, some preprocessing will be done to the initial data set in order to prepare it for some machine learning techniques. \n\nThen, classification models like Logistic Regression, kNN, LightGBM, SVC, Neural Nets, etc. will be used to help predict which employees are at risk of leaving. The classification models and techniques will be compared with each other to assess performance against each other.

Younger Employees (Age) tend to have higher Attrition rates\n- Similarly to Age, employees with lowest level stock options and lowest jobs also tend to have higher attrition rates\n- Also, many of the year features (Total Working Years, Years with Current Manager, Years at Company, etc.) have a general downward trend with regard to attrition rates. In other words, people with less years have higher attrition percentages\n- In addition, many of the survey like features (Job Involvement, Work Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, etc.) tend to have higher attrition percentages the lower an employee scored.\n- There are a few strange observations as the number of employees for a particular range die down. For example, there is one employee with Attrition with 40 total working years (and no other employees in that range), so that results in a '100%' attrition percentage for that range. This can be misleading.\n\nLet us now take a look at the discrete/categorical features\n\n**Discrete/Categorical Features Colored by Attrition**"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"17a60e622f6d39b5da66c441691ce8b663c12dce"},"cell_type":"code","source":"cat_cols = list(data.select_dtypes(exclude=np.number).columns)\n\nfig_rows = 2\nfig_cols = 4\nfig = tls.make_subplots(rows=fig_rows, cols=fig_cols, \n                          subplot_titles=tuple(cat_cols));\ncurr_row = 1\ncurr_col = 1\nfor i, col in enumerate(cat_cols):\n    yaxisStr = ''\n    offset_val = -0.3\n    if col not in ['Attrition']:\n        offset_val = -0.2\n    trace1 = go.Bar(name='No Attrition', opacity = .8, width= 0.6,#offset = -0.03,\n                x= data[data['Attrition'] == 'No'][col].value_counts().index.values,\n                y= data[data['Attrition'] == 'No'][col].value_counts().values,\n                marker=dict(color = 'steelblue', line=dict(color='black',width=1)))\n    trace2 = go.Bar(name='Yes Attrition', opacity = .8, width= 0.6,offset = offset_val,\n                x= data[data['Attrition'] == 'Yes'][col].value_counts().index.values,\n                y= data[data['Attrition'] == 'Yes'][col].value_counts().values,\n                marker=dict(color = 'orange',line=dict(color='black',width=1)))\n    tmp3 = pd.DataFrame(pd.crosstab(data[col],\n                    data['Attrition'].replace('Yes',1).replace('No',0)), )\n    tmp3['Attr%'] = tmp3[1] / (tmp3[1] + tmp3[0]) * 100\n    extra_yAxis = 'y' + str(fig_rows * fig_cols + i+1)\n    trace3 =  go.Scatter(x=tmp3.index,y=tmp3['Attr%'],mode = 'markers',\n        yaxis = extra_yAxis,name='% Attrition', opacity = .8, \n        marker=dict(color='black',size= 10))\n    fig.append_trace(trace1, curr_row, curr_col)\n    fig.append_trace(trace2, curr_row, curr_col)\n    if col not in ['Attrition']:\n        fig.append_trace(trace3, curr_row, curr_col)\n        fig['data'][-1].update(yaxis=extra_yAxis)\n        if curr_col == fig_cols:\n            yaxisStr = '% Attrition'\n        fig['layout']['yaxis' + str(fig_rows * fig_cols + i+1)] = dict(range= [0, max(tmp3['Attr%'])+10], \n                         showgrid=True,  overlaying= 'y'+str(i + 1), anchor= 'x'+str(i+1), side= 'right',\n                         title= yaxisStr)\n    \n    curr_col+=1\n    if curr_col >= fig_cols+1: # Zero Indexing for '-1'\n        curr_row += 1\n        curr_col = 1\n\nfig['layout'].update(title =  'Count of Categorical Variables in Dataset Colored by Attrition', \n                     width = 900, height = 600,\n                     showlegend=False, barmode = 'overlay', font=dict(size=10))\n\npy.iplot(fig)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"51292124315750c769216034b14936fb40d2b3b2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, the black dots help show the percentage of employees that turned over (left/attrition) for that partuclar value of that category.\n\nOne of the more obvious differences in percentages is Overtime.

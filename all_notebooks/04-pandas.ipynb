In order of increasing complexity, these are `concat`, `join`, and `merge`. Most of what `merge` can do can also be done more simply with `join`.\n\nThe simplest combining method is `concat`. This function works just like the `list.concat` method in core Python: given a list of elements, it will smush those elements together along an axis.\n\nThis is useful when we have data in different `DataFrame` or `Series` objects but having the same fields (columns). One example: the [YouTube Videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new) dataset, which splits the data up based on country of origin (e.g. Canada and the UK, in this example). If we want to study multiple countries simultaneously, we can use `concat` to smush them together:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"canadian_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/CAvideos.csv\")\nbritish_youtube = pd.read_csv(\"../input/youtube-new/GBvideos.csv\")\n\npd.concat([canadian_youtube, british_youtube])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`pd.DataFrame.join` lets us combine different DataFrame objects which have an index in common.

In this case, I am using the creditcard-fraud-detection dataset and just playing around with the IsolationForest model. As you can see, the precision that I am getting for detecting fraud is not that great (82%). I will continue to look at in how to improve (or perhaps you can give me pointers?) for fraud detection as I have read somewhere iforest should be the best anomaly detection."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A little bit about myself. I was a practicing engineer in Canada that has industry experience mostly in the energy industry space.

There are 4 predominant service catergories.\n\n        a. Early chilhood school  b. Elementary school  c. Middle school  d. High school\n\nSince, student apply for SHSAT in their 8th and 9th grade, middle schools contribution towards the SHSAT success are expected to be high as compared to other categories. Elementary schools contribution also need to be analysed separately. Interestingly also, more than 50% of the NYC schools serve till Elementary level. Therefore, a significant proportion of the entire student population do migrate each year from Elementary school to Middle school/Middle-High school.\n\n* Study : Understand Economic Need Index(ENI) - More than 50% of NYC schools has ENI greater than 70%. Social and Economic status of students(population) highly impact their performance in schools. Therefore, it is imperative to measure that impact.\n\n* Study : ELA and Math proficiency - There is a distinct group of schools where they are significantly lacking in ELA when theirs Math performance stands extremely good. Mainly because significant % of enrolled student's first language is not English. Race/Ethnicity distinction are also prominent between the groups.\n\nIn the very end, I tried to put a Conversion Scheme and Priority Ranking model.\n\n### Second Part\n\nIn this part, I have tried to see the growth of district 5 schools enrollment, registration and participation in SHSAT over the years. And, the result clearly shows growth for most of them has decreased over the years with few of them being expection.\n\nAdditionally, I have used one external data source to compare how ELA proficiency has evolved over the years for various groups(By Ethnicity, Gender, Economic condition, English language learners etc.)\n\nNote : Since no good SHSAT dataset is publicly available, I have taken a basic assumption of - Proficiency in ELA and Math (as determined by the US Common-Core standards) at each grade(3-8) represent students growth and acts as an indicator for a students success in the SHSAT. However, this will be a serapate study to prove the hypothesis - 'Proficient students(in ELA and Math) are more successful in the SHSAT'.\n\n###### Acknowledgement : I do appreciate all other kernel authors and their works here. I try to follow them mostly and they heavily motivates my study here."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import scale\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"546015ec2246baa365687484be204aef53319579","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### Read : School data 2016\nschool_data = pd.read_csv(r'../input/data-science-for-good/2016 School Explorer.csv')\n\n### Reda : D5 SHSAT\nd5_shsat_data = pd.read_csv(r'../input/data-science-for-good/D5 SHSAT Registrations and Testers.csv')\n\n### Read : NYC school meals income levels [Source : Socrata]\nnyc_school_meals_income_levels = pd.read_csv(r'../input/nyc-school-meals-income-levels/nyc-school-meals-income-levels.csv')\n\n### Read : School ELA Results 2013-2017 (Public)\n\nschool_results = pd.read_csv(r'../input/school-ela-results-20132017-public/School ELA Results 2013-2017 (Public)_consolidated.csv')\n\n### Used datasets\nprint('School data 2016 : ',school_data.shape, '\\nDistrict 5 SHSAT data : ', d5_shsat_data.shape,'\\nNYC school meals income levels : ', nyc_school_meals_income_levels.shape, '\\nNYC School ELA Results(2013-2017) : ',school_results.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"285b62046df4bd90971be714f71557d1d7b95a3f","collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"############### Pre-processing ###############\n\n### Grade Low/Grade High -

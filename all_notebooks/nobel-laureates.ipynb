The most Nobel of Prizes\n<p>Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and industrialist most famously known for the invention of dynamite. Alfred Nobel died in 1896. In his will, he bequeathed all of his \"remaining realisable assets\" to be used to establish five prizes which became known as \"Nobel Prizes\". Nobel Prizes were first awarded in 1901. In 1968, a sixth prize was established in the field of Economic Sciences; however, it is not considered a \"Nobel Prize\" but a \"Nobel Memorial Prize\".\nThe Nobel Prize is not a single prize, but five separate prizes that, according to Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, are awarded \"to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind‚Äù.\nNobel Prizes are awarded in the fields of <em>Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace</em>. Nobel Prizes are widely regarded as the most prestigious awards available in their respective fields.\n    The prize ceremonies take place annually. Each recipient (known as a \"<em>Laureate</em>\") receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a monetary award. A prize may not be shared among more than three individuals, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be awarded to organizations of more than three people. Although Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously, if a person is awarded a prize and dies before receiving it, the prize is presented.<br><em>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize</em><br><p>The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016.</p>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading in required libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport squarify\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\nimport dateutil\n\n# Reading in the Nobel Prize data\nnobel = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nobel-laureates/archive.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Making an assessment of the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Taking a look at the dataset information\nprint(\"The dataset information is listed below:\")\nnobel.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# To get number of rows count quickly\nprint('There are '+ str(nobel.shape[0]) + ' rows and '+ str(nobel.shape[1]) +' columns')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# And to get all the column names\nnobel.columns = ['Year', 'Category', 'Prize', 'Motivation', 'Prize_Share', 'Laureate ID',\n       'Laureate_Type', 'Full Name', 'Birth_Date', 'Birth City',\n       'Birth_Country', 'Sex', 'Organization Name', 'Organization City',\n       'Organization Country', 'Death_Date', 'Death_City', 'Death_Country']\nnobel.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get a summary of the dataset statistics\nnobel.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Creating diffirent datasets"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"PhysicsDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Physics')]\nChemistryDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Chemistry')]\nMedicineDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Medicine')]\nLiteratureDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Literature')]\nPeaceDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Peace')]\nEconomicsDF = nobel[(nobel.Category == 'Economics')]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Since when Nobel prices were awarded?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"first_year = min(nobel['Year'])\nlast_year = max(nobel['Year'])\nn_years_since = last_year - first_year\n\nn_dist_year = nobel['Year'].nunique()\nn_dist_cat = nobel['Category'].nunique()\nn_dist_lau = nobel['Laureate ID'].nunique()\n\nn_no_award_year = last_year - first_year - n_dist_year + 1\n\ndist_cat = nobel['Category'].nunique()\nn_lau = nobel['Laureate ID'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('First awarded in the year :', first_year)\nprint('Last awarded in the year :', last_year)\nprint('No. of years since first award :', n_years_since)\nprint('No. of unique years at least one award is given :', n_dist_year)\nprint('No. of unique years no award is given :', n_no_award_year)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

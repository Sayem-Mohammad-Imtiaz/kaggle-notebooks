Data from 2014-2019 was compiled from individual reports sourced from OSMI, an organization that conducts annual surveys to generate a better understanding of how mental health is addressed within tech companies. Data from a total of 3483 tech employee submissions were used in this analysis.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n* In the last five years, employees that have access to mental health benefits have increased by an average of 2.6% per year (41% to 54%). However, an average of 28% of tech employees don't know if they have any mental health benefit coverage.\n* In 2019, 53% of employees were unaware of the details or options of their mental health benefits coverage, which is a 13% increase from 2014.\n* As of 2019, 58% of employers do not have any formal discussions regarding mental health benefits or support. Over the course of 5 years, employers discussing mental health wellness or support has increased by an average of only 3% each year.\n* In 2019, 34% of employers provided educational resources to help employees gain a better understanding of the available opportunities to address or support their mental health through company benefits. Employers that provide educational resources have increased by an average of 3% each year.\n* From 2014 to 2019 an average of 63% of employees don't know if their anonymity will be protected if they were to use mental health or substance abuse treatment programs provided by their employer.\n* An average of 38% of employees are comfortable discussing mental health with their direct supervisor. Compared to comfort levels in 2014, results from 2019 reported a decrease by 1%.\n\n### Actions and Takeaways\n\n* In order to dramatically increase the number of employers that provide mental health benefits, providing data and evidence that supports potential incentives for both the employer and employee, could drive adoption. This could be accomplished by designing and implementing new research projects with a goal of determining if mental health benefits have a direct impact on employee rentention, creativity, or productivity. \n* It appears that there is a considerable segment of employees that are unaware if they have access to mental health benefits. If they do have coverage they are unsure of the programs that are available. Additionally, employees are not confident that their anonymity will be protected if they decide to use a benefit or program to address their mental health. These concerns and lack of awareness could be addressed by conducting an assesment of the current onboarding process, the methods used to communicate, and the frequency of communication. A survey could also be conducted to determine any support, training, or education needed to improve communication bewteen the employer and employee regarding mental health. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Process\n\nThe orginal datasets were sourced from [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/research). Datasets were available for 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The dataset from 2020 was omitted due to a low number of respondents. Each dataset was downloaded and compiled into a [unified spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rXXKnH4HUqScyYQTO5wSwW5dfhUBftKsZLcSNxE0t9U/edit?usp=sharing), which is where the majority of the data cleaning process was completed.

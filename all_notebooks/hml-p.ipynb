From data analysis, many conclusions have been made and information were inferred such as short-term loan was preferred by majority of the loan applicants and the clients majority apply loan for debt consolidation.\n4. From predictive analysis, Logistic regression in simple terms predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data. We generated a confusion matrix with accuracy, precision, recall score of 83%, 85% and 73% for the model.\n5.

between them, let us explain how when you look at our patients we will notice high levels of cholesterol this high levels lead to high levels of blood pressure, but actually, there are no high levels of blood pressure that is because the rate of Na to K is too low, I think there were high missing quantities of Na, these missing quantities with high levels of cholesterol leads to high levels of blood pressure, but there the Na to K rate is too low, this because when there's a lot of missing Na quantity the body needs to big quantities of K to prevent Na makes high levels of blood pressure.\n\nSo the health complication for this drug are:\n\n1. leads to high levels of cholesterol\n2. leads to missing big quantities of Na\n3.

The goal of the report is to provide data that can help and guide policy makers. The index is shown alongside key factors such as:\n1. GDP per capita\n2. Healthy life expectancy,\n3. Available social support,\n4. The degree of freedom to make decisions about one’s life,\n5. Generosity in a society, and\n6. The absence of corruption.\n\nThis kernel / notebook is an investigation of the factors listed along the index and how might they be correlated to it. Why the overall happiness of a country might vary over the years and how policy makers can use this index to make better decisions for citizens is the prime motivation behind the project."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2fabea203fd9d60f9693ce2462d512466d53a053"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Definition of factors***\nAll of the scores generated above are obtained by the U.N using the services of Gallup World Poll - a set of nationally representative surveys undertaken in more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. \n1. ***Happiness Index*** : \nThe main methodology to obtain this is the use of a ***Cantril Ladder*** to gauge public opinion on a very specific question. This question serves as perfect definitions of the factor :\n“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder  represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”\n\n2. ***GDP Per Capita*** :\nGDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population. That makes it the best measurement of a country's standard of living. It tells you how prosperous a country feels to each of its citizens. Here the U.N. uses a time series to fill in unreleased GDP Per Capita values with references from OECD Economic Outlook No 102 (Edition November 2017) and then, if missing, forecasts from World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects (Last Updated: 06/04/2017). The GDP growth forecasts are adjusted for population growth with the subtraction of 2015-16 population growth as the projected\n2016-17 growth.\n\n3. ***Health Life Expectancy***\nHealthy life expectancy (HLE) is a population health measure that combines mortality data with morbidity or health status data to estimate expected years of life in good health for persons at a given age. The time series of healthy life expectancy at birth are calculated by the authors based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Development Indicators (WDI), and statistics published in journal articles.\n\n4. ***Social support (or having someone to count on in times of trouble)***\nIs the national average of the binary responses (either 0 or 1) to the GWP question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?”.\n\n5. ***Freedom to make life choices***\nIs the national average of responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n\n6. ***Generosity***\nIs the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n\n7. ***Corruption Perception***\nThe measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?” The overall perception is just the average of the two 0-or-1 responses. In case the perception of government corruption is missing, the U.N. uses the perception of business corruption as the overall perception. The corruption perception at the national level is just the average response of the overall perception at the individual level."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"42bbd10b53b5e993006ba255b278af6d15225213"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Data Gathering***\nThe data for this project was gathering from two primary sources :\n1.

It is an expected result as higher GDP shows that there is more value addition in the economy or there is a higher income or rise in expenditure which implies that there is a rise in the standard of   living of the citizens and due to rise in income there will be a higher spending on various goods and services like healthcare, education, etc. Better quality of life can thus have a possible correlation with the happiness index.\n\n    Some observations worth noting here are the clusters that form at the very top. The bubbles in that cluster comprise primarily of Scandinavian countries. They seem to have a higher happiness index as compared to countires like the UAE, Luxemberg, Singapore and Qatar even though the latter countires have higher GDPs. At the other end of the specturm there is Somalia, a country who's GDP is reported as 0 [possibly due to the GDP being scaled] and yet score higher on the happiness index rank than many other nations. This result is really suprising as Somalia has been embroiled in civil war since 1999 and yet its citizens have reported a happiness score of 4.9. It leads to further questioning as to the methodologies used by the U.N or if only certain parts of Somalia were considered however keeping in mind the fact that the U.N used survey participants distributed across country geographically to get a wholistic representation it makes for a truly suprising result.\n\n\n2. ***Score vs Health Life Expectancy***\nAnother correlation that comes with little suprise is between the happiness index and Health Life Expectancy. Again we see the Scandinavians form the top cluster, while Nigeria here is an outlier with a score of 5.11 even though it is significantly low on the life expectancy score.\n\n\n3. ***Score vs Social Support***\n\n    There is a strong correlation here. The United Arab Emirates scores poorly and yet is significantly happier on the      index.\n\n\n4. ***Score vs Corruption***\n\n    Uninteresting\n\n\n5. ***Score vs Generosity***\n\n    Unintersting\n\n\n6. ***Score vs Freedom to make life choices***\n\n    Unintersting"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1bc592f922b50c51939a8483e55b75d2fd1a6f91"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Hypothesis Testing\n\nBased on our exploration of the data set done above, we came up with the following Hypothesis to test :\n\n#### 1.

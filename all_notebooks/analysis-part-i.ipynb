concentrated around the 0\\$ - 200\\$ dollars interval. \n\nThe beautiful boxplot between price and neighbourhood tells us which are the most affordable neighbourhoods and which are the most premium ones and also distribution is consistent so it could mean that this feature play some crucial rolew towards ouyr model.\n\nThe boxplot between room_type and price shows a very realisitic thing that the complete apartment or property will be expensive in compare to private and shared rooms also there is not much difference between the price for a private and a shared room so one can go for private room for most of the time.\n\nAnd last, from the bedrooms/price box plot, the prices are split in a consistent way. That could be another interesting feature for the model because, for example, decision trees find the best feature splits to model the prices distribution according to the predictor features. This graph indicates that the price of the property increases as the number of bedrooms increases (A kind of obvious observation) but with some different behaviour around 7 to 10 bedrooms since there is probably a limited amount of listings with that number of bedrooms.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

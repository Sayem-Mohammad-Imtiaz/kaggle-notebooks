This data is usually in the form of real numbers, and our goal is to estimate the underlying function that governs the mapping from the input to the output.\n\n# Generalized Linear Models \nThe following are a set of methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables. \n\nIn mathematical notion, if `(𝑦^)` is the predicted value.\n\n**𝑦^(𝑤,𝑥) =𝑤0+𝑤1𝑥1+...+𝑤𝑝𝑥𝑝**\n\nAcross the module (`Scikit-Learn`), we designate the vector `𝑤= (𝑤1,...,𝑤𝑝)` as `coef_` and `𝑤0` as `intercept_`\n\n# Ordinary Least Squares\nvisualization on: `http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/`\n\n`LinearRegression` fits a linear model with coefficients `𝑤= (𝑤1,...,𝑤𝑝)` to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation. Mathematically it solves a problem of the form:  \n\n$$\n\\min _{w}\\|X w-y\\|_{2}^{2}\n$$\n\nHowever, coefficient estimates for Ordinary Least Squares rely on the independence of the model terms. When terms\nare correlated and the columns of the design matrix X have an approximate linear dependence, the design matrix\nbecomes close to singular and as a result, the least-squares estimate becomes highly sensitive to random errors in the\nobserved response, producing a large `variance`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Importing our dataset from CSV file:\ndataset = pd.read_csv(\"../input/student-scores/student_scores.csv\")\n\n# Now let's explore our dataset:\ndataset.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's take a look at what our dataset actually looks like:\ndataset.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# To see statistical details of the dataset, we can use describe():\ndataset.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#And finally, let's plot our data points on 2-D graph our dataset \n#and see if we can manually find any relationship between the data:\n\ndataset.plot(x='Hours', y='Scores', style='o')\nplt.title('Hours vs Score')\nplt.xlabel('Hours Studied')\nplt.ylabel('Percentage Score')\nplt.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**From the graph above, we can clearly see that there is a positive linear relation between the number of hours studied and percentage of score.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preparing our data:\n# Divide the data into \"attributes\" and \"labels\".

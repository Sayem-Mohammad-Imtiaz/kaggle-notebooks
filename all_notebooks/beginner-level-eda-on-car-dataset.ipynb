This could be a possible reason why the count of vehicles that used Standard aspiration was higher than the ones that used Turbo aspiration.\n3. While both of them are almost equal, vehicles with 4 doors have higher average price than vehicles with 2 doors. However the average price of vehicles with 4 doors is higher than vehicles with 2 doors. This means some other factor is coming into play, for instance, people find vehicles with 4 doors more convinient.\n4. The average prices of vehicles based on body type is (ascending order):\n    1. Hatchbacks\n    2. Sedans\n    3. Wagons\n    4. Convertible\n    5. Hardtops\n  \n  Hatchbacks and Sedans have the highest counts when compared with other body types, with Sedan having higher count than\n Hatchback. However, the average price of Hatchbacks is lower than Sedans. Hence, another factor could be coming into play, for instance, Sedans, for their bigger size are preffered more than Hatchbacks, which have a relatively smaller size. Hardtops and Convertibles are usually hard to obtain, hence their count was low and due to their high performance, their average price is higher.\n5. FWD drivewheel has the lowest average price, followed by 4WD, with RWD having the highest average price. This could explain why FWD vehicles has a higher count compared to other two. However, 4WD vehicles' count was the lowest, but its average price goes higher than RWD. One of the possible reasons that can explain this is that 4WD vehicles specializes for off-road driving purpose. Hence, it is not preferred by most of the sample.\n6. Vehicles with engine located at the front have a lower average price, explaining the high count of the same when compared to vehicles with engine located at the rear.\n7. OHC and OHCF have the lowest average prices, which OHC being slightly lower. This explains the high count of OHC when compared to other engine types.\n8. Vehicles with 3 cylinders have the lowest average price, followed by vehicles with 4 cylinders. However, the count of 4-cylinder vehicles greatly surpassed others. One of the possible reasons that can explain this is that most common number of cylinders used in a vehicle is 4.\n9. MPFI fuel system has the highest average price as well as the highest count. This means some other factor is coming into play, for instance, MPFI systems are more efficient, and more widely used.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Numerical Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"num = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].dtype!='O' and feature!='car_ID']","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df[num]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Inference: There are 15 numerical variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Unique Values**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for feature in num:\n    print(\"There are %d unique features in the column %s.\" %(len(df[feature].unique()), feature))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Discrete numerical data**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Using 25 as the threshold value for classfying a numerical variable as discrete or continuous.

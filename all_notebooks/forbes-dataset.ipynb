The first is the unbalanced dominance of the age group of billionaires in their 50s. In China, this group alone represents about 50% of all the wealth accumulated by billionaires, and it is the richest age group worldwide by far. The second feature emerging is related to the dramatic shift in the sectors from which the billionaires derived their fortunes between the age groups in their 40s and 30s and those above. Economic activities related to real estate and pharmaceutical generated the greatest number of billionaires and concentration of wealth in all the age cohorts above the 40yo. In general, in these groups, the economic sector landscape is related to the old economy and manufacturing activities such as food&beverages, chemicals, automobile, apparel and so forth. However, as we enter into the 40yo cohort, the picture changes. This age group is made up of persons who were in their 20s at the turn of the century when the Internet took off and spread worldwide. This economic revolution is fully represented here. True, real estate and pharmaceutical are still on the list. However, they definitely moved to a secondary role. Internet-related services took the lead as billionaires churning out sectors. E-commerce billionaires in their 40s show the greatest concentration of wealth among all the age/sectors combinations. Other relevant sectors are Online Games, Software and Internet Media. The economic revolution is then definitely confirmed by the sector compositions of the next age cohort, the billionaires in their 30s. Here all the traditional economic sectors have disappeared. Moreover, new emerging forces shaping the economy can be identified. They are connected to the spreading application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and new forms of mobility.  As a result, along with sectors as video streaming, e-commerce and social networks, new fortunes are now created in electric vehicles and health IT businesses. For instance, in a ranking dominated by man, the latter is represented by Gong Yingying, Founder and Chairwoman of Yidu Tech, a leading medical big data and AI company in China and worldwide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_age_US_agg=df_age_US.query('Self_made==True').groupby(['age_group','Source'])['Name','NetWorth'].agg(Count_Names=('Name','count'),Total_whealth=('NetWorth','sum')).sort_values(by='Count_Names',ascending=False).reset_index()\ndf_age_US_agg.sample(5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.883396Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.884036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.922702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.88399Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.921582Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Tree map representing most number of Billionaires\nax= px.treemap(df_age_US_agg,path=[\"age_group\",'Source'],width=1500, height=1100,values='Count_Names',color='Total_whealth',title='First Generation Billionaires in the USA: Treemap Representation by Age and Source',color_continuous_scale='RdBu',)\nax.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.924269Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.924994Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-27T00:53:17.205601Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-27T00:53:16.924923Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-27T00:53:17.204628Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Moving to the USA, the first feature catching the observer's attention is the number of billionaires that own their fortune to activities related to the financial sector. The Forbes dataset differentiates the financial sector in many sub-categories such as investment, private equity,  hedge funds, money management, venture capital, finance, and several more. Together, these sectors have churned out the greatest number of billionaires in each age group, save among those in their 90s. However, in this case, I suspect that the difference is mostly due to a survival bias. On the contrary to what happened in China, the real estate sector played only a marginal role in creating new billionaires, save the cohort of the 80yo. In the USA, the shockwaves of the emerging new economy in the billionaires' composition starts to propagate only in the age groups younger than 80yo. The software sector, for instance, is an important creator of new billionaires among the 70s and in all the age groups until the 40yo group. It generated the highest accumulation of wealth among the billionaires in their 60s and 70s. As we move down the age groups, new sectors appear, such as e-commerce, cybersecurity,  social networks, online services and so forth. As in China, when the younger group are analyzed, new sources of wealth appear, and they are connected with the most recent economic development. Cryptocurrencies are an important billionaires incubator in the 40yo and 30yo age groups. Billionaires that created smartphone applications are specific to the age groups going from the 30s to the 20s. Forbes dataset is not particularly helpful to identify this group since it classifies phone apps in details, differentiating among application for dating, sport, trading, food delivery and so forth. On the contrary to the Chinese case, the USA manage to have a small group of billionaires in the 20yo group, with food delivery applications and sensor technologies as the source for their wealth. Despite the higher growth rate recorded in China, the USA still appears like the place where it is possible to get rich faster, as proved by the higher number of billionaires in their 30s and 20s.\n\n### **Conclusions**\n\nIn this article, we took a deep dive into the Forbes dataset of the richest men on the hearth. First, a general overview of the dataset with its features and shortcoming has been provided. After a quick foray into the relationship between the number of children and wealth, billionaires' geographic distribution has been analyzed according to different dimension and clusters identified. Then China and the USA, the two main clusters, have been studied in greater details.  Again the geographic distribution within these countries as well as the wealth distribution among billionaires. After restricting the focus on the self-made billionaires, the relationship between Age and Origin of Wealth has been studied in details in both countries. Critical features within each of these two countries have been highlighted and studied along with their evolution in time according to the source of wealth.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

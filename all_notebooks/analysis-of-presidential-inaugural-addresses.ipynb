Inaugural addresses have become shorter.\nAs evidenced by the visualizations for both the number of characters and number of space-separated words, inaugural addresses have become significantly shorter as time has progressed. This is most likely due to the fact that the audience which presidents are appealing to have become more diverse in nature including people from all backgrounds, not just wealthy white males.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"Q9i6uwxHmZVL"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### B. Inaugural addresses have become easier and less complicated.\nAs evidenced by the visualizations for both the number of difficult words and Dale-Chall scores, inaugural addresses have become significantly easier and more understandable as time has progressed. This is again due to the fact that presidents are appealing to a broader audience from different educational backgrounds. In addition to this, inaugural addresses are now broadcasted on tv, radio, youtube, etc. This means that along with adults, several kids and younger people are watching the speeches now, requiring the address to be approachable and understandable for everyone.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"G05_yqVEnStV"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### C. Overall themes haven't changed much.\nAs can be seen from the word cloud, presidents have been using the same buzzwords and rhetorical choices for the last 200 years or so. The strategy of developing a mood of patriotism and overcoming challenges is consistent throughout the years and is often used by politicans to distract the audience from other issues and portray themselves in a positive light.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"h2BsnOtLoEEl"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### D. What next?\nThere are a couple of things that could improve this analysis, which I plan to work on in the future. Firstly, data for political parties and information such as age and social background could potentially be very useful in analyzing how the characteristics of a president or political party affect the tone, difficulty, and length of an inaugural address. Secondly, some insight into historical events could also explain why some presidents gave much longer and difficult speeches whereas others gave much shorter and approachable ones.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"EwTYHz3qp0Hj"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### E.

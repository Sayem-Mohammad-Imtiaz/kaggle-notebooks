{"cells":[{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6b3af36accf2a30fac761b82f3dadfe6cb7c9271"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> This project explores publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). This project aims to create a model to show profiles of borrowers with a high probability of paying back this loan. \n> The columns in the dataset represent the following:\n> * credit.policy: 1 if the customer meets the credit underwriting criteria of LendingClub.com, and 0 otherwise.\n> * purpose: The purpose of the loan (takes values \"credit_card\", \"debt_consolidation\", \"educational\", \"major_purchase\", \"small_business\", and \"all_other\").\n> * int.rate: The interest rate of the loan, as a proportion (a rate of 11% would be stored as 0.11). Borrowers judged by LendingClub.com to be more risky are assigned higher interest rates.\n> * installment: The monthly installments owed by the borrower if the loan is funded.\n> * log.annual.inc: The natural log of the self-reported annual income of the borrower.\n> * dti: The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower (amount of debt divided by annual income).\n> * fico: The FICO credit score of the borrower.\n> * days.with.cr.line: The number of days the borrower has had a credit line.\n> * revol.bal: The borrower's revolving balance (amount unpaid at the end of the credit card billing cycle).\n> * revol.util: The borrower's revolving line utilization rate (the amount of the credit line used relative to total credit available).\n> * inq.last.6mths: The borrower's number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months.\n> * delinq.2yrs: The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years.\n> * pub.rec: The borrower's number of derogatory public records (bankruptcy filings, tax liens, or judgments)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as

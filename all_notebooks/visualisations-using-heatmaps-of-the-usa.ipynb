A data set about the counties in the United States\n\nThrough these 2 data sets, we hope to answer the following question:\n\n> One criticism of farmers markets is that they are largely inaccessible to many Americans, especially those of low socio-economic status. \n> Does the data reflect this criticism?\n\nIn this notebook, I will be using heatmaps to visualise the data presented in the data sets and attempt to address the question.\n\n## Short answer\nTl;dr: No, the data does not reflect that lower income regions have less access to farmers markets, in fact the income level is quite constant throughout the entire region. Rather, the markets are present in wherever the population is larger, regardless of income level. However, the data set doesn't reflect the cost of items sold at those markets, I feel that such a variable can better answer the question posed above.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# install the necessary libraries\n!pip install us\n!pip install gmaps","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for plotting graphs\nimport math\n\nimport us # for converting state names to numeric geolocation\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go # to plot heatmaps\nimport gmaps # to plot heatmaps using Google Maps\n\n# libraries for folium heatmaps\nimport folium\nfrom folium import plugins\n\n# libraries for displaying image files in a notebook\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom PIL import Image","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Farmers Market Data set\nLet's have a look at the variables present in this data set and the number of missing values.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"farmers_mkt = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/farmers-markets-in-the-united-states/farmers_markets_from_usda.csv')\n\nprint(farmers_mkt.shape)\nprint('-'*40)\nfarmers_mkt.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Some information about Farmers Markets data set\n* FMID: Farmers Market Identitification Number.\n* Website: Website for the market.\n* Facebook/Twitter/Youtube/Other Media: Handles or websites to the market's social media page.\n* zip: zipcode\n* Season dates: There are many dates here, Season1Dates etc. Refers to the dates that belongs to this Season.\n* Season times: There are many season duration and dates here, Season1Time etc. Refers to the operating times in this Season.\n* x: Longitude\n* y: Latitude\n* Location: Generic location of market, some values include 'Local government building grounds'.\n* Credit/WIC/WICcash/SFMNP/SNAP: Payment mode.

When coding, this library is written as sklearn, as you will see in the sample code. Scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames.\n\nThe steps to building and using a model are:\n\nDefine: What type of model will it be? A decision tree? Some other type of model? Some other parameters of the model type are specified too.\nFit: Capture patterns from provided data.

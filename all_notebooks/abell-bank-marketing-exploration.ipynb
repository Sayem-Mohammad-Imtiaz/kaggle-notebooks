Of all the approaches, the most effective \n\nI've avoided making a model that predicts based on the length of the calls, as this seems a bit circular. This differs from many examples I have found online, which found that call duration is a good predictor. My hope was to try and explore a bit deeper than this, and predict based on more independent data.\n\nThe bottom line is that the results are not very positive. But why? Well, if I were to take more time to get to the bottom of it, I would explore more rigorous approaches to tuning the models. The other interesting thing, which appears in the article connected to this data, is that they made a reasonable prediction using neural networks. This is something I would like to try if I had more time, but so far I avoided it because I do not feel neural networks are a good \"default\" approach, unless the task is something like image classification. The reason is that it is hard to visualize what a NN has actually done, at the end, when we are dealing with a mix of quantitative and qualitative data. Especially socio economic data... but perhaps I'm being too pessimistic, and it's worth a try to see how NNs compare to random forest approaches, SVMs,  etc.\n\nThe other point is data pre-processing. Although \"inflating\" the proportion of \"Yes\" samples in the training data still only resulted in 70% recall, and a lot of false-positives (translating to a lot of wasted time calling \"Nos\"), it's important to note that this did increase the recall relative to the random-sampling case (training Yes/No proportions equal to that of the full data set.) Interesting, but not shocking: we gave our model more Yes examples, so it tended to guess \"Yes\" more frequently when it saw the test data. While accuracy of ~75%, and recall of ~70% are better than a coin-flip, this is probably not enough of a trade-off to implement the model in actual callee-selection. Perhaps the undersampling method however could be tuned more for better results.\n\nBased on the simple pre-analysis I did, using violin plots, etc., I realize that there is one data dimension seriously lacking here. That is an objective, quantitative indicator of a customers income, or better yet, disposable income. After all, someone cannot sign up for a term-deposit if they do not have a surplus of cash to deposit. Even just the fact that someone is wealthy is not an indicator of this, since their budget could be strictly balanced. As of now, there is no data that separates the objective \"Ability to deposit\" from the subjective \"Willingness to deposit\".\n\nMy main reason for suspecting the need for such data, is the relatively high percentage of \"Yes\" responses for customers over the age of 60, and the same for the \"retired\" category. While it is speculative, it may be the case that some of these are individuals with lifetime savings, open to wealth-management options. But by the same token, as the advanced age group overlaps with the low-eduation (basic.4yr) group, we could speculate that some of them did not understand the details of the call. It's worth considering, and maybe getting more data, but not nearly strong enough evidence to make a marketing recommendation."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d57f3fb7-ad70-42e1-9c1a-8c07e9c3b297","_uuid":"a89487267d82d154dfa6efaf3961fafb12749810"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 6.3***) Modeling experiments:  Playing with MCA\n\n* **This section was added just out of my own curiosity.

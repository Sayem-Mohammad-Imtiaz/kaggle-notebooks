Most of those consists of two stages:*\n\n* **Stage 1 — Signal transformation\n**Construct a signal that maximises the features of interest, in our case this is the QRS-complex.\n\n* **Stage 2 — Decision rule \n**Use a threshold to separate the desired features from the rest of the signal\n\nA lot of peak detectors use a very neat trick for transforming the signal (stage 1) and I found it worth diving into that. It’s called [template matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_matching).\n\nTemplate matching is widely used in pattern recognition, for example in [particle analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15065671), cryptanalysis, [computer vision](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272496016_Template_Matching_Techniques_in_Computer_Vision_Theory_and_Practice) and [computational neuroscience](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2014/919406/). It’s an elegant and powerful technique that uses a filter (also known as template or kernel), that contains a **specific feature** and use that filter to find this feature in a larger signal.\n\n![Cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity between two signals (image taken from [Giphy](https://media.giphy.com/media/VVPKOXc6aY1Lq/source.gif))](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*mWsGTGVdAsy6KoF3n3MyLA.gif)\n\nBasic idea is to slide the filter along a signal and compute the [cross-correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation) between the filter and the signal. If the filter matches a part of the signal closely, there is a strong correlation, which is another way of saying this part of the signal looks a lot like the feature in the filter. By setting a threshold (stage 2), you are able to find features you’re interested in.\n>  Cross-correlation is often referred to as **convolution**, which is a slightly different operation where the filter is reversed f(t) -› f(-t) before sliding it along the signal. Convolutional Neural Networks should actually be named Cross-correlation Networks, but i guess that didn’t make it through the marketing department :-)\n\nIn images you could use this technique to find horizontal or vertical edges by designing specific filters. Convolutional Networks take this approach even further and learn filters that are relevant for certain classes automatically using back propagation.\n\n*Allright, so template matching seems great. Lets see how we can use it to find some RR-intervals!*"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"766fc734b87e7defcb4a1221a9d9b0d8ea15640c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def detect_peaks(ecg_signal, threshold=0.3, qrs_filter=None):\n    '''\n    Peak detection algorithm using cross corrrelation and threshold \n    '''\n    if qrs_filter is None:\n        # create default qrs filter, which is just a part of the sine function\n        t = np.linspace(1.5 * np.pi, 3.5 * np.pi, 15)\n        qrs_filter = np.sin(t)\n    \n    # normalize data\n    ecg_signal = (ecg_signal - ecg_signal.mean()) / ecg_signal.std()\n\n    # calculate cross correlation\n    similarity = np.correlate(ecg_signal, qrs_filter, mode=\"same\")\n    similarity = similarity / np.max(similarity)\n\n    # return peaks (values in ms) using threshold\n    return ecg_signal[similarity > threshold].index, similarity","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"aa36c5c3f3a9b580090a27db8e20a04b243787ab"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_plot_ranges(start=10, end=20, n=5):\n    '''\n    Make an iterator that divides into n or n+1 ranges. \n    - if end-start is divisible by steps, return n ranges\n    - if end-start is not divisible by steps, return n+1 ranges, where the last range is smaller and ends at n\n    \n    # Example:\n    >> list(get_plot_ranges())\n    >> [(0.0, 3.0), (3.0, 6.0), (6.0, 9.0)]\n\n    '''\n    distance = end - start\n    for i in np.arange(start, end, np.floor(distance/n)):\n        yield (int(i), int(np.minimum(end, np.floor(distance/n) + i)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"be2eac172819e397eb45abac693bd8c3b483b370"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sampfrom = 60000\nsampto = 70000\nnr_plots = 1\n\nfor start, stop in get_plot_ranges(sampfrom, sampto, nr_plots):\n    # get slice data of ECG data\n    cond_slice = (df.index >= start) & (df.index < stop) \n    ecg_slice = df.heartrate[cond_slice]\n\n    # detect peaks\n    peaks, similarity = detect_peaks(ecg_slice, threshold=0.3)\n    \n    # plot similarity\n    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))\n\n    plt.subplot(211)\n    plt.title(\"ECG signal with found peaks\")\n    plt.plot(ecg_slice.index, ecg_slice, label=\"ECG\", color=\"#51A6D8\", linewidth=1)\n    plt.plot(peaks, np.repeat(600, peaks.shape[0]), label=\"peaks\", color=\"orange\", marker=\"o\", linestyle=\"None\")\n    plt.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Time (milliseconds)\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Amplitude (arbitrary unit)\")\n    \n    plt.subplot(212)\n    plt.title('Similarity with QRS template')\n    plt.plot(ecg_slice.index, similarity, label=\"Similarity with QRS filter\", color=\"olive\", linewidth=1)\n    plt.legend(loc=\"upper right\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"Time (milliseconds)\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"Similarity (normalized)\")\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7cb6bde9cfafdba62d2edb37a122dfa46a10d60e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"What’s interesting, is that there are some rather suppressed R-peaks that still have a large similarity (around 66.000 ms).

In a healthy heart, there is a natural variation, which is due to a balance between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic parts (PSNS) of the Autonomous Nervous System. If your body experiences stress, then the sympathetic system will activate, to prepare for fight or flight behaviour, and your heartrate will increase. The parasympathetic controls your body’s “rest and digest” responses and is associated with recovery. Parasympathetic activation conserves energy, constricts pupils, aids digestion, and slows your heart rate. These two parts of the nervous system are normally in a healthy balance, causing a natural variation in heart. If this balance is disturbed for any reason, this variance will change. A lower RMSSD is associated with stress and various illnesses.\n\n**Other metrics**\n\nRMSSD is often used as the score that represents your “HRV”.

Now we can create an evenly spaced set of datapoints that we can use for the frequency analysis.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d74c329ed076bddb2039e676e7dc1629baf71e11"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# create interpolation function based on the rr-samples. \nx = np.cumsum(rr_manual) / 1000.0\nf = interp1d(x, rr_manual, kind='cubic')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d74c329ed076bddb2039e676e7dc1629baf71e11"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# sample rate for interpolation\nfs = 4.0\nsteps = 1 / fs\n\n# now we can sample from interpolation function\nxx = np.arange(1, np.max(x), steps)\nrr_interpolated = f(xx)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c004f613b2503c608d0f5fcf9f04794e642f30b6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20, 15))\n\nplt.subplot(211)\nplt.title(\"RR intervals\")\nplt.plot(x, rr_manual, color=\"k\", markerfacecolor=\"#A651D8\", markeredgewidth=0, marker=\"o\", markersize=8)\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (s)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"RR-interval (ms)\")\nplt.title(\"Interpolated\")\nplt.gca().set_xlim(0, 20)\n\nplt.subplot(212)\nplt.title(\"RR-Intervals (cubic interpolation)\")\nplt.plot(xx, rr_interpolated, color=\"k\", markerfacecolor=\"#51A6D8\", markeredgewidth=0, marker=\"o\", markersize=8)\nplt.gca().set_xlim(0, 20)\nplt.xlabel(\"Time (s)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"RR-interval (ms)\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"206cea2abe20dccb2ac9a1ad7a098f5053d8790a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def frequency_domain(rri, fs=4):\n    # Estimate the spectral density using Welch's method\n    fxx, pxx = signal.welch(x=rr_interpolated, fs=fs)\n    \n    '''\n    Segement found frequencies in the bands \n     - Very Low Frequency (VLF): 0-0.04Hz \n     - Low Frequency (LF): 0.04-0.15Hz \n     - High Frequency (HF): 0.15-0.4Hz\n    '''\n    cond_vlf = (fxx >= 0) & (fxx < 0.04)\n    cond_lf = (fxx >= 0.04) & (fxx < 0.15)\n    cond_hf = (fxx >= 0.15) & (fxx < 0.4)\n    \n    # calculate power in each band by integrating the spectral density \n    vlf = trapz(pxx[cond_vlf], fxx[cond_vlf])\n    lf = trapz(pxx[cond_lf], fxx[cond_lf])\n    hf = trapz(pxx[cond_hf], fxx[cond_hf])\n    \n    # sum these up to get total power\n    total_power = vlf + lf + hf\n\n    # find which frequency has the most power in each band\n    peak_vlf = fxx[cond_vlf][np.argmax(pxx[cond_vlf])]\n    peak_lf = fxx[cond_lf][np.argmax(pxx[cond_lf])]\n    peak_hf = fxx[cond_hf][np.argmax(pxx[cond_hf])]\n\n    # fraction of lf and hf\n    lf_nu = 100 * lf / (lf + hf)\n    hf_nu = 100 * hf / (lf + hf)\n    \n    results = {}\n    results['Power VLF (ms2)'] = vlf\n    results['Power LF (ms2)'] = lf\n    results['Power HF (ms2)'] = hf   \n    results['Power Total (ms2)'] = total_power\n\n    results['LF/HF'] = (lf/hf)\n    results['Peak VLF (Hz)'] = peak_vlf\n    results['Peak LF (Hz)'] = peak_lf\n    results['Peak HF (Hz)'] = peak_hf\n\n    results['Fraction LF (nu)'] = lf_nu\n    results['Fraction HF (nu)'] = hf_nu\n    return results, fxx, pxx","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0dedfa9a920256149bfc1a53ceace88b049e97c7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Frequency domain metrics:\")\nresults, fxx, pxx = frequency_domain(rr_interpolated)\n\nfor k, v in results.items():\n    print(\"- %s: %.2f\" % (k, v))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"148fe1ccc85eccf2da67c92a5a8dcdc7306f2bd2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Welch periodogram"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"557b29224bf95c8197179b2077adb6efad331ca2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20, 7))\nplt.plot(fxx, pxx, color=\"k\", linewidth=0.3)\nplt.title(\"FFT Spectrum (Welch's periodogram)\")\n\n# create interpolation function for plotting frequency bands\npsd_f = interp1d(fxx, pxx)\n\n# setup frequency bands for plotting\nx_vlf = np.linspace(0, 0.04, 100)\nx_lf = np.linspace(0.04, 0.15, 100)\nx_hf = np.linspace(0.15, 0.4, 100)\n\nplt.gca().fill_between(x_vlf, psd_f(x_vlf), alpha=0.2, color=\"#A651D8\", label=\"VLF\")\nplt.gca().fill_between(x_lf, psd_f(x_lf), alpha=0.2, color=\"#51A6D8\", label=\"LF\")\nplt.gca().fill_between(x_hf, psd_f(x_hf), alpha=0.2, color=\"#D8A651\", label=\"HF\")\n\nplt.gca().set_xlim(0, 0.5)\nplt.gca().set_ylim(0)\nplt.xlabel(\"Frequency (Hz)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Density\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"662b9b4dfa8d474ad1e33fc7791d614e5072e7cd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Non linear methods\n\n### Poincare plot\n\nIn Poincaré HRV each RR interval is plotted against the next RR interval.

Previous learnings when studying convolutional networks just got new meaning, and I learned how to create my own personal peak detection algorithm, yay!\n* I just love plotting with matplotlib and seaborn. You always learn a great deal when you try to create meaningful plots.\n* I learned that there are still many things left to explore. Most importantly, what say about the physiological state if we measure HRV? How can we use HRV in practice as an indicator for stress or illnesses? \n\nI hope you found this kernel useful and if you have any questions of comments please let me know!

Only Pennsylvania has a smaller density (0.47). Therefore the situation in New York is critical not only because the virus has spread more there, but also because there are very few ICU units for those who need it, which eventually will lead to more deaths. That's why it is necessary to build hospitals just to treat COVID-19 pacients, and that [seems to be happening](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals.html).\n___\n\n## COVID in New York\nWe know from the news (even if you are not from the US, such as myself) and we've seen in this notebook that New York is critical.

The greatest issue is the number of hospitals - and more precisely, ICUs - the state has available to treat those that do indeed need a more intensive treatment. The less of such units we have available, the more people who end up really sick don't get the required treatment, and the number of deaths increase. So, in a certain aspect, it is all about having hospitals and equipment to treat them all.

Moreover, we can notice a clear, sudden increase from day 24 to 25. Coincidentally or not, this is on the same time windows the positive results restarted to increase in the Daily Increase graph. Of course, as the number of sick people increase, we expect the same to the number of hospitalized cases, but there may be a reason related to both variables that happened as well. Not only that, but the number of hospitalized people increased faster than the number of daily increases.

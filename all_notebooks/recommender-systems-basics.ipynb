The content of each item is represented as a set of descriptors or terms, typically the words that occur in a document. The user profile is represented with the same terms and built up by analyzing the content of items which have been seen by the user.\n\nSeveral issues have to be considered when implementing a content-based filtering system. First, terms can either be assigned automatically or manually. When terms are assigned automatically a method has to be chosen that can extract these terms from items. Second, the terms have to be represented such that both the user profile and the items can be compared in a meaningful way. Third, a learning algorithm has to be chosen that is able to learn the user profile based on seen items and can make recommendations based on this user profile.\n\nThe greatest advantage in content-based filtering systems is that the recommendations provided can easily be interpreted to user, because we always know what \"features\" about particular item made algorithm rate it higher.\n\nWhen we have the representation of our item or user as a vector of features, we can measure use metrics such as cosine distance to measure similarity between user profile vector and item

It then maps these probabilities to a lower dimensional space (usually 2D). The probabilities in 2D need to match, as close as possible, to the probabilities in the higher dimensional space. TSNE minimises the divergence between these probabilities via gradient descent on the Kullback–Leibler divergence between high dimensional and low dimensional probabilities. The 2D output coordinates dont represent any of the features in the original dataset, and are used purely for visualisation, so are usually just labelled 'X' and 'Y'.\n\nTSNE preserves local structure, but not global structure - so in 2D clusters that are close together are most probably close together in higher dimensions; similarly, clusters in 2D that are far apart are most likely far apart in higher dimensions. But global structure (the bigger picture shape) of the higher dimensional object will most probably be completely distorted in lower dimensions - this kind of makes sense, because how can you visualise 600 dimensional shapes in just 2 dimensions? Like trying to visualise a 3D sphere on a 1D line, it's hard.\n\nThe Barnes-Hut method is used so distance probabilities need not be calculated between every single point, rather only groups of points, reducing the complexity from $N^2$ to $N\\log N$\n\np.s. TSNE should only ever be used for visualisation and not to train clustering models on, as asked here :)\nhttps://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/263539/k-means-clustering-on-the-output-of-t-sne/264647#264647","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"# this make take 5 minutes\ntsne = sklearn.manifold.TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=0)\nmatrix_2d = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"df_tsne = pd.DataFrame(matrix_2d)\ndf_tsne['Name'] = df_dummies['Name']\ndf_tsne.columns = ['x','y', 'Name']\n# rearrange columns\ncols = ['Name','x','y']\ndf_tsne = df_tsne[cols]\n# show the 2D coordinates of the TSNE output\ndf_tsne.head(10)","metadata":{"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"g = df_tsne.plot.scatter(\"x\", \"y\", s=10, figsize=(20, 12), fontsize=20)\ng.set_ylabel('Y',size=20)\ng.set_xlabel('X',size=20)","metadata":{"scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"Wow!

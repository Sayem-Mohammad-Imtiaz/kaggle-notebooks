To do this I will use a simple linear regression to see if the median sales number has increased or decreased over time. \n\n## 1.1 Loading the Data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bc28c0a7-8164-44c7-4fc5-3ea7d5d134fe"},"outputs":[],"source":"%matplotlib inline\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/Video_Game_Sales_as_of_Jan_2017.csv')\ndata.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"66f5f12e-f895-5332-0a6a-553e2f59f320"},"source":"## 1.2 Cleaning the Data\nAs the data set stands, it needs a little bit of cleaning before it can be analyzed.  First, video games with unknown release years should be omitted.  Furthermore, the video games released in 2017 will also be omitted since the data was gathered in January and the sales of those video games have not yet reached full potential.

To determine the starting year two things should be considered: the yearly global sales and at what point in time were all genres being continuously released.  Fortunately, a starting year can be chosen by looking at the total yearly global sales, the cumulative proportion of yearly global sales and the heat map of global sales of games release each year by genre.  Using these three plots below it can be seen that all genres are not fully represented until 1991 and more than 95% of the global sales occur after 1991.

Since the total number of games released each year varies, the total global sales for each genre would not be a consistent measure over time.  Furthermore, by plotting a histogram of the global sales it is easy to see the data is highly skewed to the right, meaning the yearly average of the global sales for each genre will not be an acceptable measure.

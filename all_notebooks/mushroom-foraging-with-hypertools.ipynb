The rise of sophisticated machine learning and other analytic techniques has undoubtedly revolutionized how we view data, and the kinds and amount of information we can wring out of it. Modern computers have greatly surpassed our own abilities in number-crunching speed and in handling massive quantities of data. You might think that the story ends here, and we should just surrender to the machine.\n\nHowever, there is still a place for us lowly humans: Our visual brains are phenomenal at detecting complex structure and discovering patterns in massive quantities of data.  In fact, that is just what our visual systems are designed to do.  Every second that your eyes are open, data (in the form of light on your retina) is pouring into visual areas of your brain. And yet remarkably, you have no problem at all recognizing a neat looking shell on a beach, or your mom's face in a large crowd.  Our brains are 'unsupervised-pattern-discovery-aficionados', and we can harness that power to make some fascinating discoveries about the nature of our world.\n\nBut hang on now, not so fast: there is one MAJOR drawback to our visual systems: we are essentially capped at perceiving in 3 dimensions (or 4 including changes over time), and most datasets today have much higher dimensionality.  \n\nSo, the question of the hour is: **how can we harness the incredible pattern-recognition powers of our brains to visualize complex and high dimensional datasets?**\n\nIn comes *dimensionality reduction*, stage right. Dimensionality reduction is just what it sounds like - reducing a high dimensional dataset to a lower dimensional space.  For example, say you have a dataset of mushrooms, where each row is comprised of a bunch of features of the mushroom, like cap size, cap shape, cap color, odor etc.  The simplest way to do dimensionality reduction is to just remove some of the features. However, this is problematic if the features you drop contain valuable diagnostic information about that mushroom. A slightly more sophisticated approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by only considering its **principal components**, or the combination of features that explains the most variance in the dataset. Using a technique called *principal components analysis* (or PCA), we can reduced the dimensionality of a dataset, while preserving as much of its precious variance as possible.\n\nSo, we are now equipped with the computational prowess to forage for mushrooms using HyperTools, a python toolbox for visualizing and manipulating high-dimensional data, which is built on top of familiar friends like matplotlib, scikit-learn and seaborn.

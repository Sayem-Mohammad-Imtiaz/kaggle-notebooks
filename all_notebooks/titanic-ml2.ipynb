INTRODUCTION THAT HOW MODEL WORKS\n**FOR EXAMpLE:my best friend has a real estate buisiness and he earns lot of money but he had a challenge that as his buisiness is increasing\nhe had difficulty in predicting the cost of the houses because each house consists of many variations...so he consulted\nme as i am a data scientist he asked me predict the houses\n**so the matter comess here as my friend told the intuition of previous data with that i can predict the unseen data\n**in this problem statement i will be going to use desicion tree as thre are many other models but for now i am going to use DT...\nbecause decision tree is easy to understand..\n**for now we are creating a decision tree which consists of two splits  like if we have many variables like lot size,car parking\n,arae,etc...then we can create many more

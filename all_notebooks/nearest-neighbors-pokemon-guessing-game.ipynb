{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Nearest Neighbors Pokemon Guessing Game\n\nThis was a fun idea I had while doing some EDA with the pokemon dataset. The objective is to guess the randomly selected pokemon based on 4 of its neighbors and their abilities. Some of them are easier than others, but it's still kinda fun!\n\nJust copy this notebook and run all. Keep running the second to last cell to get a new pokemon, and run the last cell to reveal the answer.\n\nI will probably implement it with a GUI with TKinter if I have spare time in the future. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (15, 7)\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"FILE_PATH = \"/kaggle/input/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420/pokedex_(Update_05.20).csv\"\ndf_pokemon_full = pd.read_csv(FILE_PATH)\ndf_pokemon_full = df_pokemon_full.drop(\"Unnamed: 0\", axis=1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"INFO_CATEGORIES = [\"pokedex_number\", \"name\",  \"type_1\", \"type_2\", \"ability_1\", \"ability_2\", \"ability_hidden\", \n                   \"status\", \"egg_type_1\", \"egg_type_2\"]\nSTATS_CATEGORIES = [\"hp\", \"attack\", \"defense\", \"sp_attack\", \"sp_defense\", \"speed\"]\n\ndf_pokemon = df_pokemon_full[INFO_CATEGORIES + STATS_CATEGORIES].copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"NN = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 5, algorithm=\"ball_tree\")\nNN.fit(df_pokemon[STATS_CATEGORIES])\n\ndist, ind = NN.kneighbors([df_pokemon[STATS_CATEGORIES].iloc[0]])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import display, HTML\n\npokemon = df_pokemon.sample(1)\npokemon_index = np.where(df_pokemon[\"name\"] == pokemon[\"name\"].iloc[0])[0][0]\n\ndist, ind = NN.kneighbors(pokemon[STATS_CATEGORIES])\nind = list(ind.reshape(-1))\ndisplay(df_pokemon.iloc[[i for i in ind if i != pokemon_index]])\n\nprint(\"Hint: Pokemon abilities are:\")\nprint(pokemon[\"ability_1\"].iloc[0])\nprint(pokemon[\"ability_2\"].iloc[0]) if pokemon[\"ability_2\"].iloc[0] is not np.nan else None\nprint(pokemon[\"ability_hidden\"].iloc[0]) if pokemon[\"ability_hidden\"].iloc[0] is not np.nan else None\n\nprint(\"Distances:\")\nprint(list(dist.reshape(-1)[1:]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pokemon","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://www.melhoresdestinos.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Dicas-Airbnb.jpg)<br><br>\n\nAirbnb is an **online marketplace** for short-term house and apartment rentals. With it you can, for example, rent out your house for a week while youâ€™re away, or rent out your empty bedroom. Since Airbnb is a market, pricing works just like anything in life: the amount a host usually charges is closely tied to market prices(supply and demand). The search experience on Airbnb looks like this:\n\n<br><br>\n![](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f06784bb36b2d0d2914d1bb8af40f48d/tumblr_nnhegoQEfu1ur02gdo1_1280.png)\n<br><br>\n**Goal of the analysis**\n\nAs seen above, the general Airbnb host is someone who has some spare space and want to get some revenue, without having to worry too much about advertising and insurance. \nAirbnb does it all for the host, but there is one thing it can't do: help price their property. Since the price can vary a lot according to country, currency, neighborhood and the host itself, it is simply too complex to provide a general service on that.\n<br>\nThe goal of the analysis is to visualize and clean overall Airbnb data from **Rio de Janeiro**, and then build a predictive model specific to the city, in order to assist hosts from Rio to price their listings based on the market standard.\n<br>\nSince the model is intended to be used by the general public, possibly some accuracy will be given up in exchange for a higher simplicity.\n<br>\n\n**Deployment**\n\nAfter the model is complete, the goal is to make it available to the general public, first on a web application, and on the future, possibly on an app available to **Android** and **iPhone**. <br>\n\n\n\n**Data**\n\nThe dataset used contains detailed data about every listing on the site for every month(except june 2018, the source did not scrape data for that month), from april 2018, to may 2020. The main characteristics I consider to be relevant for our model are:\n\n`Seasonality`: do prices tend to raise or decrease at specific months?\n`Features of the listing`: How big is the property? how many bedrooms, beds and bathrooms?\n`Behavior of the host`: Do listings with more detailed description tend to be priced higher? Does the host demand clear identification from the renter?\n`Neighborhood`: How much does the geographic position influences the price?\n\n**The currency for every price contained in the dataset is reais(R$).**<br><br>\n\n![](https://super.abril.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rio-de-janeiro.png)\n\n\n**Credits**\n\nI want to thank [duygut](https://www.kaggle.com/duygut) for this [great work](https://www.kaggle.com/duygut/airbnb-nyc-price-prediction) on a similar dataset from NYC.

Hosts that take the time to write every single amenity probably put more work into renting it, and therefore, charge more.\n<br>\n\n`property_type` performed worse than expected. I suspect that it is because it has a high cardinality(too many categories), with little to no difference in meaning.

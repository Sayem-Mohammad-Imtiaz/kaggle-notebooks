Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along with core model specification and fitting functionality, PyMC3 includes functionality for summarizing output and for model diagnostics. \n\n#Features\n\nPyMC3 strives to make Bayesian modeling as simple and painless as possible, allowing users to focus on their scientific problem, rather than on the methods used to solve it. Here is a partial list of its features:\n\nModern methods for fitting Bayesian models, including MCMC and VI.\n\nIncludes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n\nUses Theano as the computational backend, allowing for fast expression evaluation, automatic gradient calculation, and GPU computing.\n\nBuilt-in support for Gaussian process modeling.\n\nModel summarization and plotting.\n\nModel checking and convergence detection.\n\nExtensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.\n\nBayesian models can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.https://docs.pymc.io/history.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTvHBuqvPabtkjFyfuUhBjZ-Za2ZyTmeWbvzw&usqp=CAU)\n\nmorioh.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nfrom matplotlib.pylab import *\nfrom pymc3 import *\nimport numpy as np\n\nd = np.random.normal(size=(3, 30))\nd1 = d[0] + 4\nd2 = d[1] + 4\nyd = .2*d1 +.3*d2 + d[2]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lam = 3\n\nwith Model() as model:\n    s = Exponential('s', 1)\n    tau = Uniform('tau', 0, 1000)\n    b = lam * tau\n    m1 = Laplace('m1', 0, b)\n    m2 = Laplace('m2', 0, b)\n\n    p = d1*m1 + d2*m2\n\n    y = Normal('y', mu=p, sigma=s, observed=yd)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"with model:\n    start = find_MAP()\n\n    step1 = Metropolis([m1, m2])\n\n    step2 = Slice([s, tau])\n\n    trace = sample(10000, [step1, step2], start=start)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"traceplot(trace);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"hexbin(trace[m1],trace[m2], gridsize = 50)\naxis('off');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's Kaggle Notebook Runner: Mar√≠lia Prata   @mpwolke","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

During this process we used Plotly, seaborn and matplotlib to do the visualizations. During the data preprocessing part, we converted features into numeric ones, grouped values into categories and created a few new features. Afterwards we started training machine learning models, and applied cross validation on it. Of course there is still room for improvement, like doing a more extensive feature engineering, by comparing and plotting the features against each other and identifying and removing the noisy features. You could also do some ensemble learning.Lastly, we looked at it’s confusion matrix and computed the models precision."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your feedback is very important to me,I hope this kernel is helpfull for you -->> upvote will appreciate me for further work."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Recommeder system creates a similarity between the user and items and exploits the similarity between user/item to make recommendations.\nmain benefits of the recommender system are as follow:\n1. it's easier for the user/consumer to choose the product/service, which leads to better user experience. \n2. Boosting user interaction with the system or leading to higher sales. For example, there's 40% more click on the google news due to recommendation.\n3. Better matching the product/service with user/consumer needs.In Amazon , 35 % products get sold due to recommendation.\n4. Creates more personalized experience for the user/consumer. such as In Netflix most of the rented movies are from recommendations.\n\n\n# Types of Recommendation Systems\nThere are mainly 6 types of the recommendations systems :-\n1. Popularity based systems :- It works by recommending items viewed and purchased by most people and are rated high.It is not a personalized recommendation.\n2. Classification model based:- It works by understanding the features of the user and applying the classification algorithm to decide whether the user is interested or not in the product.\n3. Content based recommendations:- It is based on the information on the contents of the item rather than on the user opinions.The main idea is if the user likes an item then he or she will like the \"other\" similar item.\n4. Collaborative Filtering:- It is based on the assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste. it is mainly of two types: a) User-User b) Item -Item\n5. Hybrid Approaches:- This system approach is to combine collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other approaches .\n6. Association rule mining :- Association rules capture the relationships between items based on their patterns of co-occurrence across transactions.\n\n# About this Project\nIn this project I present ways to make a recommended list of products for a user similar to what Amazon does based on review ranking of the item. Given the ranking of items, create a list of top 10 products to be recommended to the given customer, based on the purchase history of other customers in the website. Amazon uses currently item-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive datasets and produces high quality recommendation systems in the real time. This system is a kind of an information filtering system which is used to predict the \"rating\" or preferences which a user is interested in.\nExpected output for the solution is a deployable model that can generate a list of recommended items for a given user, based on history of purchase of the same user as well as the ranking of the similar items in reviews. The number of recommended items is 10 items, but also per customer the items that already have been purchased are deducted from the list, so the number of recommendations is max 10 and minimum 3. However there are so many solution for providing recommended list of items both\n\n\n\n**problem statement**\nIn this project I would like to explore ways to make a recommended list of products for a user similar to what Amazon does based on review ranking of the item.

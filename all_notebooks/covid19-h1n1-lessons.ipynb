SHARFSTEIN   OCTOBER 29, 2020\n\nAs the country and the world eagerly await vaccines to curb the Covid-19 pandemic and allow us to return to normal social and economic activities, preparing to monitor these vaccine for safety is critical task.\n\nWhy is safety monitoring needed after vaccines are found to be very safe and effective in the rigorous process of testing them in randomized controlled trials? Those trials establish which vaccines are effective and identify their most common adverse effects. But adverse reactions that are uncommon, appear only after a delay, or occur in subpopulations excluded from or inadequately included in clinical trials may not emerge until the vaccine is being widely used.\n\nAnother reason is that when vaccinating a large number of people, some will have heart attacks or strokes, develop diabetes or dementia, experience new-onset epilepsy, or have other health issues. Rapid and rigorous science is needed to determine if these events were caused by the vaccine or would have happened regardless of vaccination.\n\nThe process for separating real adverse reactions from coincidental events must be rapid and credible.\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/10/29/lessons-h1n1-monitoring-covid-19-vaccine-safety/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Rigor, objectivity, and transparency.\n\nBy the time the pandemic had faded, the H1N1 vaccine helped millions of people stay healthy without a safety problem — real or coincidental — derailing the program. This system to identify safety issues was developed using the principles of good governance and public health practice to ensure trust: rigor, objectivity, and transparency.\n\nThe need for monitoring the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines after they are licensed and are being widely used is far greater today than it was for H1N1. Public health officials had decades of experience with influenza and influenza vaccines, and much was already known about the safety of these vaccines. In contrast, no coronavirus vaccine has ever existed. And some of the new vaccines are based on novel technologies, such as mRNA or DNA, and new vectors, such as the adenovirus.\nhttps://www.statnews.com/2020/10/29/lessons-h1n1-monitoring-covid-19-vaccine-safety/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Plotly Packages\nfrom plotly import tools\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\n# Matplotlib and Seaborn\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom string import ascii_letters\n\n# Statistical Libraries\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom scipy.stats import skew\nfrom scipy.stats.stats import pearsonr\nfrom scipy import stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Vaccine hesitancy\n\nAdd in vaccine hesitancy, which has only grown as a problem over the last decade.

There were delays in production, supply shortages, and difficulties administering the new vaccine.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, by April 2010, the majority of Canadians (59 per cent or 16.5 million people) had not been vaccinated against the H1N1 virus, which was also known as the “swine flu.”\n\nThere were a number of reasons why there were delays in the rollout of the vaccine in Canada – timing being a key one – as the H1N1 virus spread in the spring of 2009 and the vaccine wasn’t ready until months later, in the fall, when health-care providers were trying to administer seasonal flu shots.\n\nEarl Brown, a virologist and a former member of Canada’s H1N1 Pandemic Vaccine Task Group, added that manufacturers were also preoccupied with creating a vaccine for avian influenza H5N1, or the “bird flu,” when they were forced to suddenly turn their attention to the new swine flu outbreak.\n\nWhile Canada’s ambitious vaccination program for H1N1 may have had some hiccups along the way, the experience may provide some valuable lessons for the administration of future vaccines, such as those already in the works to combat against COVID-19.\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/health/covid-19-vaccination-lessons-from-canada-s-largest-ever-mass-immunization-effort-1.5138256"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#“Vaccine Nationalism.”\n\nDuring the H1N1 pandemic, the federal government was criticized for relying on only one domestic vaccine supplier, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), to manufacture the vaccine.\n\nCountries often prefer to produce their own vaccines domestically, in case there are border closures or what can be called “vaccine nationalism.” However, the dependence on only one supplier comes with its own risks because any disruptions or interruptions in the production line can cripple the whole’s country’s supply.\n\nIn the case of GSK, there were difficulties bottling the vaccine at their Quebec plant, which caused delays.\n\nAn internal review of the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada’s response to the H1N1 pandemic addressed the government’s use of a sole vaccine supplier. The review stated that, at the time, there was only one manufacturer “interested in establishing sufficient domestic capacity to manufacture enough vaccine to inoculate the entire population in the event of an influenza pandemic.”\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/health/covid-19-vaccination-lessons-from-canada-s-largest-ever-mass-immunization-effort-1.5138256"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 10)\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nsns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)\nplt.title('Correlation Plot', fontsize = 20)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes by Shivangi Garg  https://www.kaggle.com/shivangigarg160997/pandas-profiling-and-to-choose-best-model"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas_profiling as pp \nprofile = pp.ProfileReport(df) \nprofile","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Handling Missing Values"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# categorical features with missing values\ncategorical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>0 and df[feature].dtypes=='O']\nprint(categorical_nan)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Vaccine Distribution\n\n\"In preparation for a vaccine for the coronavirus, the Canadian government has already been pre-ordering supplies, such as vials and syringes, and working on logistics to store and transport the vaccine once it is ready.\n\n“You have to be ready to get, store, distribute that vaccine and so that is something the public health addresses and they will have to be ready to achieve that,”\n\nIt’s a considerable undertaking with respect to Canada’s population of more than 35 million people.\n\n“Not everyone will want a vaccine, not everyone will get it, but in broad numbers, 35 million vaccines would be needed or 20 million, and then if you need two doses, that’s double that.” \nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/health/covid-19-vaccination-lessons-from-canada-s-largest-ever-mass-immunization-effort-1.5138256"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# replacing missing values in categorical features\nfor feature in categorical_nan:\n    df[feature] = df[feature].fillna('None')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[categorical_nan].isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lets first handle numerical features with nan value\nnumerical_nan = [feature for feature in df.columns if df[feature].isna().sum()>1 and df[feature].dtypes!='O']\nnumerical_nan","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[numerical_nan].isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Replacing the numerical Missing Values\n\nfor feature in numerical_nan:\n    ##

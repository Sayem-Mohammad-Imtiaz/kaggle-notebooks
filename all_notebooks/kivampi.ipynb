Because we reach the borrowers on our [Lending Page](http://www.kiva.org/lend) through field partners, we don't usually have a chance to directly assess their level of wealth or poverty. Having a more accurate or precise estimate of each borrower's level of poverty would be valuable to us for several reasons. For example:\n\nMaking sure new funding sources target the poorest Kiva borrowers.\nAllowing lenders to select low-income borrowers when that's their goal.\nAssessing new potential field partners\n\nWhile we don't have direct measures, we do have a variety of informative variables that (we suspect) could jointly predict levels of income or financial access given the right training data. We're working with Kaggle because we'd like to build such a model. Our primary criteria for a good predictive model of poverty will be accuracy and coverage. Improvements on our current global model would be welcome progress, but equally welcome would be a highly accurate country-level model, especially in a country with lots of borrowers like Kenya, the Philippines, Senegal, Paraguay, or many others."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"dd58df16-7987-43b6-9ac6-cf6de8971b1e","_uuid":"ce00015b306ec1d2e670c7d28772ed3db42e103e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Kiva's Current Poverty Targeting System\nNow I'll introduce you to Kiva's current poverty targeting system, which assigns scores to field partners and loan themes based on their location using the [Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI)](http://ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/global-mpi-2017/mpi-data/) and the Global Findex dataset for financial inclusion."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1608515b-1ccd-446d-9980-615b86cd4b6c","_uuid":"d4270ea2fbcc098958fbb22404c330317e54d29a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## MPI Scores\nMPI scores are assigned at two levels of granularity, national and sub-national.\n\n### Making National MPI Scores for each Field Partner\nNation-level MPI Scores are broken into rural and urban scores.

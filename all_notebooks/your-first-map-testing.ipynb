Are the birds travelling to conservation areas?\n- Which areas of Japan could potentially benefit from extra earthquake reinforcement?\n- Which Starbucks stores in California are strong candidates for the next [Starbucks Reserve Roastery](https://www.forbes.com/sites/garystern/2019/01/22/starbucks-reserve-roastery-its-spacious-and-trendy-but-why-is-starbucks-slowing-down-expansion/#6cb80d4a1bc6) location?\n- Does New York City have sufficient hospitals to respond to motor vehicle collisions?  Which areas of the city have gaps in coverage?\n\nYou'll also visualize crime in the city of Chicago, examine health facilities in Ghana, explore top universities in Europe, and track releases of toxic chemicals in the United States.\n\nThis micro-course assumes that you have previous experience with the pandas library.  In this first tutorial, we'll quickly cover the pre-requisites that you'll need to complete this micro-course.  And, if you'd like to review more deeply, we strongly recommend the **[Pandas micro-course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)**.  \n\nWe'll also get started with visualizing our first geospatial dataset!\n\n# Reading and plotting data\n\nThe first step is to read in some geospatial data!

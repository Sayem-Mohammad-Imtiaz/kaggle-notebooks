It’s important to standardize your data in order to equalize the range of the data.\n\nFor example, imagine a dataset with two input features: height in millimeters and weight in pounds.

The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. What’s the point of this? By relying on a “majority wins” model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.\n\nFor example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0.

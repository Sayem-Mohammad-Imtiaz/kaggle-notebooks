The y-axis is plotting R, the ratio of the runs created after the salary increase (averaged over rc_post_avg years), rc_post, to the runs created before the salary increase, rc_prev. The x-axis is plotting the fractional salary increase, with a minimum requirement of 2x (and a minimum payday of 2 million dollars). In addition, the colours indicate the *scaled* rc_post value, i.e. rc_post minus the league mean divided by the standard deviation.\n\nWe can see that ~50% of the data points lie below R = 0.85, which I (arbitrarily) consider to be the threshold indicating a clear decrease in batting performance. However this in itself does not necessarily indicate that a player was a bad investment. We also must look at the scaled RC value after the salary increase, since perhaps a player still contributes greatly to his team even if he never performs quite as well as he did just before the payday. We see that ~65% of the players' have a scaled rc_post value greater than 1 standard deviation of the mean. This indicates that these players are still league leaders even if they didn't perform quite as well as their payday year, and are probably \"worth\" the salary (it's a separate discussion whether or not MLB players should be paid so much).

Hopefully his RC output continues, and this is not just an isolated good year."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Final Discussion\nBased off of the analysis above, it seems clear that \"payday\" players tend to perform worse after their salary increase. What could be the cause of this? Do they crack under the pressure? \n\nThe most likely explanation is the principle of *regression to the mean*. There is always random fluctuation in the performance of a player, and out of the entire sample of MLB players there will always be some that have an extraordinarily good year. If your exceptionally good year happens to happen when your contract is ending, you get paid. \n\nThe standard deviation of this fluctuation is player dependent, with the low R/purple coloured players in the figure above having very high standard deviation. These players are likely bad players that happened to have a fantastic year as their contract was ending. \n\nHowever, we also saw that ~65% of the players' have a scaled rc_post value greater than 1 standard deviation from the mean, indicating that these are still league leaders even if they don't perform quite as well as they did in their payday year. Thus most of the players that get big salary increases tend to deserve it.

When we look at orders data over a 30 day window,\nwe naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively\naffordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data.\n\nUsing the describe function in Pandas when looking at the summarized statistics the mean\nof the order_amount for all the stores does come out to 3145.13. So a few things we\nknow now is the average was calculated correctly using the numbers provided in the\ncsv file and that another value wasn't accidentally used.\n\nWhen examining the total_items percentiles, the numbers seem very reasonable but, when examining\nthe max items purchased we see that a max of 2000 items was purchased which could be skewing\nthe average. This is further represented by a standard deviation of 41282.5 which shows how much the\ndata is deviating from the mean.\n\nThe data had 17 occurences of purchases of 2000 items which was increasing the average by a lot so removing \nthem would be the bes course of action.\n\nWhen the dataframe was grouped and all the occurences of all the values were counted we could see other large values of 51450 and 25725\nbesides just the value of 704000 for the 17 transcations of 2000 shoes.

It is trained on a variety of data sources and tasks, with the goal of learning text representations that are useful out-of-the-box to retrieve an answer given a question, as well as question and answers across different languages.

The default signature is identical with the question_encoder signature.\n* Use the **response_encoder** signature to encode the answer and the output is a 512 dimensional vector.\n* The response_encoder signature acceptes two input fields:\n    * **text**: the answer text.\n    * **context**: usually the text around the answer text, for example it could be 2 sentneces before plus 2 sentences after, it could also be the paragraph containing the answer text. If you don't have context to include, you can duplicate of answer into this field.\n* All input text can have arbitrary length!

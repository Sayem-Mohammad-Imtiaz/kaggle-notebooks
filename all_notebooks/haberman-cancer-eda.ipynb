Correction to obsvn `4`: It is normal distribution with more spread. Mostly diverse? Yes but normal distr\n9. Cannot be used effectively for classifocation as more or less the patients from same year groups have survived or did not survive breast surgery\n    - We can see a peak in death in 1964\n    - We can also see survival is decreasing with time.\n    - Let us compare above point with survival 'rate' or death 'rate' as we cannot depend only on survival data or death data\n**My Observations:**\n    \n- Suvival rate is having little decreasing trend. Is this effect of imbalanced data? No, it is normalized. What can be reason behind this? Not our objective.\n- Survival is least in 1965. Peolple operated on 1965 have less chances of survival compared to 1961 and 67. 1963 patients have little higher chances of survival.\n- Operation year is some what good feature for classification\n- People **without more positive axil nodes** when operated upon, tend to survive more. This is intutively is correct as they may not even have had cancer!\n- People with **more positive axil nodes** when operated upon, tend to `die relatively more` and survive less.\n    - Can this contradiction be an effect of unbalanced dataset? No It shouldn't be.\n    - This means that positive axil nodes definitly indicates presence of cancer\n    - But it implies **breast surgerys are not much useful**. It only profits medical organisatons as they can perform surgeries on patients without cancer and the patient still survives. \n- For any given number of positive axil nodes (except near to zero), **Survival is always less compared to non-survival!!!**\n- This **cannot** be much of an `imbalanced dataset` as non-survival is more than half of survival bar. (63% of it to be exact = relative ratio  in cell 74)\n    - This answers obsvn. `11` doubt 1\n- Most of people have maximum ~26 positive nodes\n- One thing we can note otherwise is, (except near to zero)  **Survival is always less compared to non-survival\n* Interesting outliers for axil nodes\n* Not most, but almost all who survived more than 5 years after surgery had maximum positive axil nodes about 7 to 8\n* Median axil nodes for survived patients is zero. It is a central value\n* We perform EDA by removing outliers for survived patients.\n* see pic here](https://www.kaggle.com/l0new0lf/plot3dplotly)\n* op_year vs pairplot can be used for classification but with some misclassification errors[see pic here](https://www.kaggle.com/l0new0lf/plot3dplotly)\n* See outputs from python for MEDIAN observations"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Also, give the reason for your choice. (Example-Bureau score)? ** "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **CIBIL Score** – The CIBIL Score is a 3-digit numeric summary of the borrower’s credit history, rating and report, and it ranges from 300 to 900. The score closer to 900, would indicate a better credit rating. The score of the borrower, helps to assess their credit worthiness and also how frequently they have met their credit commitments on time. A detailed CIBIL report also gives a glimpse of credits availed by the borrower and whether they have defaulted over the same and what is the time period of such default. Therefore, critical examination of the same will prove to be a huge check for assessing the credit worthiness of the borrowers.\n\n### **Background of the borrower** – The borrower’s source of income, age and background should be clearly identified. Such as if the borrower is employed, such could be verified by latest salary slips, copy of ITR, employment proofs, credits in the bank account. If the borrower is self-employed, copy of the ITR, financial statements could be assessed to verify the same. If the borrower is a student or a minor, proper authorized from guardian should be availed. It should be critically analyzed the loan facility is not more than credit worthiness of the borrower, a LTV ratio based on the income of the borrower could be assessed and credit could be granted accordingly. \n\n### **Analysis of past defaults and frequency** – Such an analysis would establish how frequently the borrower is availing loans and how frequently have they defaulted over the same. It would highlight instances whether the borrower is dependent upon the loans for their day to day expense also and their current income is insufficient for the same. Higher past defaults will increase the credit risk of the lender, hence steps like increasing the interest rate, reducing the credit limit, requesting security could be undertaken.\n\n### **Ratio analysis** – Ratios such as debt to income ratio needs to be analyzed critically to avoid the default risk on the part of the borrowers. Borrowers with a higher debt-to-income ratio are more likely to run into trouble making monthly payments than borrowers with a lower ratio. The loan to value ratio is calculated by the total dollar amount of the loan divided by the appraised value of the collateral. As a lender we will prefer the appraised value of the borrower’s collateral to be higher than the loan amount. Liquidity ratios, such as the current ratio, quick ratio and cash ratio will also determine the borrower’s ability to meet the lending commitment when due with cash. The debt service coverage ratio will assess the cash available to meet the lending obligations. A thorough analysis of all these ratios will aid to understand the credit standing and worthiness of the borrower.

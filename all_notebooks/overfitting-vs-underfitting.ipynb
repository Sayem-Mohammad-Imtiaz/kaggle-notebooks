The plot shows the function that we want to approximate, which is a part of the cosine function. In addition, the samples from the real function and the approximations of different models are displayed. The models have polynomial features of different degrees. We can see that a linear function (polynomial with degree 1) is not sufficient to fit the training samples. This is called underfitting. A polynomial of degree 4 approximates the true function almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees the model will overfit the training data, i.e. it learns the noise of the training data. We evaluate quantitatively overfitting / underfitting by using cross-validation. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) on the validation set, the higher, the less likely the model generalizes correctly from the training data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(__doc__)\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\n\ndef true_fun(X):\n    return np.cos(1.5 * np.pi * X)\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nn_samples = 30\ndegrees = [1,4, 15]\n\nX = np.sort(np.random.rand(n_samples))\ny = true_fun(X) + np.random.randn(n_samples) * 0.1\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))\nfor i in range(len(degrees)):\n    ax = plt.subplot(1, len(degrees), i + 1)\n    plt.setp(ax, xticks=(), yticks=())\n\n    polynomial_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=degrees[i],\n                                             include_bias=False)\n    linear_regression = LinearRegression()\n    pipeline = Pipeline([(\"polynomial_features\", polynomial_features),\n                         (\"linear_regression\", linear_regression)])\n    pipeline.fit(X[:, np.newaxis], y)\n\n    # Evaluate the models using crossvalidation\n    scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, X[:, np.newaxis], y,\n                             scoring=\"neg_mean_squared_error\", cv=10)\n\n    X_test = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)\n    plt.plot(X_test, pipeline.predict(X_test[:, np.newaxis]), label=\"Model\")\n    plt.plot(X_test, true_fun(X_test), label=\"True function\")\n    plt.scatter(X, y, edgecolor='b', s=20, label=\"Samples\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"x\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"y\")\n    plt.xlim((0, 1))\n    plt.ylim((-2, 2))\n    plt.legend(loc=\"best\")\n    plt.title(\"Degree {}\\nMSE = {:.2e}(+/- {:.2e})\".format(\n        degrees[i], -scores.mean(), scores.std()))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

They are considering making an investment in a new form of transportation - BulletTrain. BulletTrain uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a high speed! While BulletTrain has mastered the technology and they hold the patent for their product, the investment would only make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months.\n \nYou need to help SOV ventures with the decision. They usually invest in B2C start-ups less than 4 years old looking for pre-series A funding. In order to help SOV Ventures in their decision, you need to forecast the traffic on BulletTrain for the next 7 months.

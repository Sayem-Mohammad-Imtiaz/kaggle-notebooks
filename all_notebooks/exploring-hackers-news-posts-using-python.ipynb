Given that, it's more accurate to say that of the posts that received comments, ask posts received more comments on average and ask posts created between 15:00 and 16:00 (3:00 pm est - 4:00 pm est) received the most comments on average.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}

Many of these employees could possibly be in the same group as the _Sales Department_, as sales positions usually require more travel.\n- __Stock Option Level__: The lower your stock option level, the higher chance you have of belonging to the attrition group.\n- __Work-Life Balance__: The minority group who rate poorly on Work-Life Balance have roughly a _50% chance_ of leaving IBM.\n- __Job Level__: The lower your job level, the higher chance you have of belonging to the attrition group. Seems to be highly correlated to _StockOptionLevel_.\n- __PerformanceRating__: Interestingly, there does not seem to be a higher probability of attrition for an employee who has a lower performance rating. It should be noted, however, that most employees who left the company do have lower performance ratings. Later we can take a second look at the ratios to confirm this.\n- __OverTime__: If an employee clocks in for overtime, they have a significant chance of eventually leaving the company. This seems to have a logical relationship with _WorkLifeBalance_ as well.\n- __JobRole__: With our current graph visualization, it is difficult to see the distribution of attrition per job role. We will take a look at this graph seperately.\n- __MaritalStatus__: Those employees who are _Single_ have a considerable chance of leaving IBM. It would be reasonable to assume that these individuals are also young who have a low _JobLevel_ and a low _StockOptionsLevel_. We can confirm this later with more exploration.\n- __TrainingTimesLastYear__: For those employees who engaged in some kind of training, they have a lower chance of leaving the company. However, those who did not engage in training seem to have a higher chance.\n- __RelationshipSatisfaction__: While not significant, those employees with a low relationship satisfaction tend to belong to the attrition group more than those who do not. This naturally goes hand-in-hand with _WorkLifeBalance_\n- __JobInvolvement__: Employees in the smallest group of Job Involvement have a significant chance of leaving IBM.\n\nWe just gained a lot of insight! While not a perfect picture, we can now form some hypothesis to determine the kinds of employees who leave IBM.

Do they work overtime, and have low relationship satisfaction?\n- Is the employee at a low-ranking position within the company, with little to no stock options?\n- Is the employee in a sales related job which contains much travel?\n- Is the employee young and single?

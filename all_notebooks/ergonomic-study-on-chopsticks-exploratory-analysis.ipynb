Just using the scatter plot, it is difficult to conclude anything, but there is a visible dip in performance between the 240 mm chopsticks and 270 mm chopsticks.\n\nI plotted a similar graph using six bins, one for each length. That graph estimated the central tendency of Food Pinching Efficiency for each length and made it really easy to tell that the 240 mm chopsticks appears to be the best fit for this group of participants.\n\nBefore finalizing my conclusion, I decided to determine the best and worst lengths for each participant and to plot the results on bar graphs. These two bar graphs made it very clear that the best length is 240 mm and that the worst length is 330 mm.","metadata":{"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"c8f72b3e-9fa0-4e27-9dd0-57b564a1c368","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"25a9407f91cf5295c01c1373e7770c1c36405a01"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# visualize everything in a single scatterplot with a trend line\nax = sns.regplot(x='Chopstick.Length', y='Food.Pinching.Efficiency', data=data)\nax.set(xlabel='Chopstick Length (mm)', \n       ylabel='Food Pinching Efficiency',\n       title='Food Pinching Efficiency vs. Chopstick Length')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"cc6f03b5-72a7-4580-928f-df5fd5df2148","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"5dbf386b499f2e5e8e4a28f749b65dd179427b9f"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# visualize everything while binning the data to keep the \nax = sns.regplot(x='Chopstick.Length', y='Food.Pinching.Efficiency', data=data, x_bins=6)\nax.set(xlabel='Chopstick Length (mm)', \n       ylabel='Food Pinching Efficiency',\n       title='Food Pinching Efficiency vs. Chopstick Length')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"af932c24-a481-424f-9ae4-161da37b5eca","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"cacbc31b4f4aaaa4aaf8f66f9aa287a1a48d9125"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# obtain the optimal chopstick length for each individual\nmaxFPE = []\noptimalLength = []\n\nfor i in range(31):\n    maxFPE.append(0)\n    optimalLength.append(0)\n\nfor index, row in data.iterrows():\n    individual = int(row['Individual']) - 1\n    if (row['Food.Pinching.Efficiency'] > maxFPE[individual]):\n        maxFPE[individual] = row['Food.Pinching.Efficiency']\n        optimalLength[individual] = row['Chopstick.Length']\n\n# print(optimalLength)\noptimalLengthCounts = dict(Counter(optimalLength))\n# print(optimalLengthCounts)\nlengths = list(optimalLengthCounts.keys())\ncounts = list(optimalLengthCounts.values())\nax = sns.barplot(x=lengths, y=counts)\nax.set(xlabel='Chopstick Length (mm)', \n       ylabel='Number of Best Performances',\n      title='Number of Best Performances for Each Chopstick Length')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"83f58e63-681d-4f99-bfb3-fa60244d64d8","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"0b7494c822a9e3efad6e77f32226bd8f1a88d8a3"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# similarly, obtain the worst chopstick length for each individual\nminFPE = []\nworstLength = []\n\nfor i in range(31):\n    minFPE.append(1000)\n    worstLength.append(0)\n\nfor index, row in data.iterrows():\n    individual = int(row['Individual']) - 1\n    if (row['Food.Pinching.Efficiency'] < minFPE[individual]):\n        minFPE[individual] = row['Food.Pinching.Efficiency']\n        worstLength[individual] = row['Chopstick.Length']\n\n# print(worstLength)\nworstLengthCounts = dict(Counter(worstLength))\n# print(worstLengthCounts)\nlengths = list(worstLengthCounts.keys())\ncounts = list(worstLengthCounts.values())\nax = sns.barplot(x=lengths, y=counts)\nax.set(xlabel='Chopstick Length (mm)', \n       ylabel='Number of Worst Performances',\n       title='Number of Worst Performances for Each Chopstick Length')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":false,"_execution_state":"idle","_cell_guid":"b2246032-0cb6-4953-9c59-e641cde32cef","collapsed":false,"_uuid":"57c593f6e3892d30e1b8cbd8dd78170e5b9e4f2f"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# Conclusions\n- The optimal chopstick length for these male college students appears to be 240 mm.\n- The worst chopstick length for these male college students appears to be 330 mm.\n- Chopsticks with a length of 240 mm may or may not be the optimal length for other adults.

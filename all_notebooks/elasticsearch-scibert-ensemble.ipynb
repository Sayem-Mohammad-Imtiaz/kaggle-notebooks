It is loosly based on [this paper by David R. Cheriton](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01718.pdf). \n\nRoughly what it does is the following:\n\n1.   Retrieve relevant papers based on keywords (this is annotated by humans)\n2.   Train a SciBERT model on the SQuAD 2.0 set for Question and Answering\n3.   Predict the answer for each of the questions based on each of the relevant articles and display the results.\n\nFor easy reading some of the sections have been hidden. In order to retrain the BERT model you need a Google Cloud Storage bucket to which you've write access. Since Kaggle doesn't provide this, the output of the model has been added as a data set. If you want to run the model yourself you should set the `is_kaggle` parameter below to `False` and enter the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket below (in the Prerequisites section)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Abstract\n\nAs Coronavirus is spreading across the world, there is a rapid acceleration in related literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up.

of hbv antigen, our observations that compound 1 can inhibit not only the hbv dna replication and rna transcription but also the hbv antigen secretion, indicates that there might be at least three targets of compound 1 antiviral activity. however, the exact mechanism of the anti-hbv activity of compound 1 remains to be completely understood and will require further investigation.in conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the compound 1 effectively inhibits hbv antigen secretion and hbv replication in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in vitro. compound 1 is, therefore,

associated regions. this is demonstrated in the current study where the l2 sirna resulted in a greater than 10-fold inhibition in extracellular viral titre compared to the l1 sirna, despite the two targeting contiguous regions of the genome.for each treatment, the magnitude of inhibition determined by measurement of virus titre was greater than the inhibition seen in viral genome copy number. although these two assays are looking at different endpoints, the consistent discrepancy may be in part explained by considering that the qrt-pcr for viral genome is able to detect cleaved, and therefore noninfectious viral genomes, that have not yet been degraded, and thus likely underestimates the potency of the sirnas.

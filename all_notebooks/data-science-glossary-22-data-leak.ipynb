Top models will use the leaky data rather than be good general model of the underlying problem.\n- It is a problem when you are a company providing your data. Reversing an anonymization and obfuscation can result in a privacy breach that you did not expect.\n- It is a problem when you are developing your own predictive models. You may be creating overly optimistic models that are practically useless and cannot be used in production.\n\n This kenel will show you what leakage is and how to avoid it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cadc882f36fae6b5e42ae885c1ce7c421071ffba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Techniques To Minimize Data Leakage\nTwo good techniques that you can use to minimize data leakage when developing predictive models:\n- Perform data preparation within your cross validation folds.\n- Hold back a validation dataset for final sanity check of your developed models.\n- Generally, it is good practice to use both of these techniques."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"846682f187d8a653bfc2e5f8f3065e9114ced320"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are two main types of leakage: **Leaky Predictors** and  **Leaky Validation Strategies.**\n\n## Leaky Predictors\nThis occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. \n\nFor example, imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data might look like this:\n\n| got_pneumonia | age | weight |  male | took_antibiotic_medicine | ... |\n|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n-\n\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. So the raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns. But *took_antibiotic_medicine* is frequently changed **after** the value for *got_pneumonia* is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia.  Validation data comes from the same source, so the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. Because when we use this model to make new predictions, that data won't be available to the model.\n\n![Leaky Data Graphic](https://i.imgur.com/CN4INKb.png)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cca14623-d55f-49ba-8907-501e9ac2acca","_uuid":"e5a3cf9b1bd44f7d2c8e8672b9e8594150d30ad6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Leaky Validation Strategy\n\nA much different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful distinguishing training data from validation data.  For example, this happens if you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split.  Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavoir..  The end result?  Your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n\n\n## Preventing Leaky Predictors\nThere is no single solution that universally prevents leaky predictors. It requires knowledge about your data, case-specific inspection and common sense.\n\nHowever, leaky predictors frequently have high statistical correlations to the target.  So two tactics to keep in mind:\n* To screen for possible leaky predictors, look for columns that are statistically correlated to your target.\n* If you build a model and find it extremely accurate, you likely have a leakage problem.\n\n## Preventing Leaky Validation Strategies\n\nIf your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use [scikit-learn Pipelines](https://www.kaggle.com/lpdataninja/data-science-glossary-16-pipelines).  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you use pipelines and do your preprocessing inside the pipeline.\n\n# Example\nHere's the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/aer-credit-card-data'>dataset link</a>.<br>\nWe will use a small dataset about credit card applications, and we will build a model predicting which applications were accepted (stored in a variable called *card*).

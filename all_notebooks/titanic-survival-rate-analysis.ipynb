In terms of gender, the highest survival rate was observed among females. When it comes to class, the highest survival rate was seen among passengers from Class 1. \nIt is only logical that the highest survival rate was observed among people from Class 1, since the location of their cabins in the ship was higher than the location of the cabins in Class 2 and Class 3. Hence, it was easier for people from Class 1 to escape the flooding vessel and reach the lifeboats. Babies, infants and females showed a higher survival rate than men because they are usually saved first in a crisis situation. Therefore, females who belonged in Class 1 showed a much higher survival rate than men from Class 3. Despite the fact that there were a lot of missing values in the age category, the highest survival rate was observed in young passengers, which makes sense, since they usually show better mobility and sharper senses to deal with emergency and high-pressure situations. Among the \"Embarked\" feature, the highest survival rate was observed among the passengers who embarked the ship through the \"C\" port, whereas the worst survival rate was observed for the \"S\" port of entry.\nA higher survival rate was observed among people who were accompanied by at least one person, while the people who were alone on the ship were less likely to survive. Finally, the highest survival rates, in terms of cabin location on the ship, were observed on the B, D and E levels, whereas the worst are on the A, G and T levels.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 2:","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The main attributes used in the analysis of the Titanic dataframe were: age, class, family size, gender (or sex), cabin, the \"survived\" attribute, fare and embarked features.\nDespite missing some values, the \"Age\" category was important for the analysis, because it revealed the mean age of the passengers who survived the Titanic tragedy, even before the adjustment of filling the missing values with a center value for the age. It also revealed the age distribution of the passengers who survived and the ones who did not. Histograms were constructed to reveal the information mentioned above.\nClass was also a very important attribute in the analysis, since it showed a trend that passengers who bought tickets for first class had a much better survival rate than the ones who were in third class, due to the location of the respective cabins in the ship. The dataframe was grouped by class, and ratios of passengers who survived the accident to the total number of passengers for each class were calculated in order to determine the survival rate of each class in the ship. Additionally, countplots with seaborn were constructed to visually represent the survival rates for the classes.\nFamily size was a new attribute used in the analysis. It involved the sum of the categories \"Parch\" and \"SibSp\", in order to reveal the quantity of family members that each passenger had on board of the Titanic. A new column was contructed in the Titanic dataframe, called \"Family\", in order to show the total number of family members per passenger. Its importance lies on the fact that the best survival rates were found to belong to small families, ideally three members (probably parents and a child). The worst survival rates were found to be among the big families (10 members), since these were probably in third class, whereas the small families were probably distributed in the first and second classes.\nGender or sex was equally important, because it revealed that the best survival rates lied among women, and the worst ones among men, probably due to human nature in face of disasters: women and children are usually saved first. Ratios between the number of women who survived the Titanic tragedy and the total number of women present in the ship (this was also done for the men) were calculated, as well as smaller dataframes using the \"groupby\" method with respect to gender were constructed. To visually represent what the dataframe showed, histograms were built comparing gender and survival rate.\nThe cabin attribute was first transformed, in order to reveal the general location in the ship, so the numbers after the first letters were removed. Nevertheless, there were a lot of missing values in the \"Cabin\" category, so its relevance was not as much as the relevance of the other attributes mentioned in this analysis.\nFinally, the obvious \"Survived\" attribute was used, in order to determine the survival rate of the passengers in the other attributes aforementioned. Since this was a dummy variable (0 for absence or death and 1 for presence or survival), it was considerably easy to work with this attribute, especially to add the number of passengers who survived and the ones who died in the tragedy and then construct all the tables seen in the analysis. Additionally, this attribute made the construction of the histograms possible, always separating into at least two graphs: one where \"Survived\" was equal to 0 and another where \"Survived\" was equal to 1.\nThe \"Fare\" attribute showed high dispersion and some outliers, since there was the presence of a small group of people who paid considerably more than the majority of the passengers on board of the Titanic. A box plot was constructed in order to visualize the outliers and a table was constructed to find out who paid such high fares.\nThe \"IsAlone\" and \"AgeBand\" categories showed valuable information in terms of survival rate. The pd.cut() method was used to separate the passengers among age bins, while the \"IsAlone\" variable was constructed by analyzing whether the \"Family\" category was 0 or different than 0. The crosstab() method was used to make pivot tables of different categories (class, family size and gender) with the age bands when it comes to survival rate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 3:","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Three attributes were created in the Titanic data frame. The \"Family\" category combined the variables \"Parch\" and \"SibSp\", which can be used to indicate the total number of family members that a passenger brought to the Titanic, including siblings, parents, children and spouses. This helped tremendously in the analysis of survival rate in terms of family size and reduced the size of the analysis, since analyzing parents and children and then siblings and spouses would be more time consuming and rather pointless, because we cannot know for sure if a certain figure in the \"Parch\" category represents a determinate amount of children or parents. \nThe \"IsAlone\" category was created with the purpose of dividing the passengers in two groups: the ones who were alone on the Titanic and the ones who were not. This allowed a more broad analysis on the survival rate.\nThe \"AgeBand\" feature was created with the purpose of grouping the passengers in terms of age bins, and to establish a correlation with the \"Survived\" feature.\nSome attributes were excluded from the analysis. They were the passenger ID and the ticket number. The reason why \"PassengerID\" was excluded from the data frame is because it is just a number assigned to each passenger, much like a serial variable in SQL, so it is nothing more than an arbitrary identifier. The reason why \"Ticket\" was also excluded is because it showed 681 unique values, while the count in the column was 891. The number of unique tickets was not close to the number of passengers, and the ticket numbers did not appear to follow any pattern we could use for grouping people in different categories, it just represented their ticket number that they bought in order to board the Titanic.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 4:","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There were two main categories with missing values: \"Cabin\" and \"Age\". The variable \"Cabin\" was modified in order to show only the letter and not the numbers, because the primary focus is the general location of the cabins of the passengers in the ship, and not the specific number of each cabin. There were a lot of missing values in the \"Cabin\" category, but this variable was not excluded from the data frame, because a passenger with his or her cabin missing could mean that he or she died; after all, how would we know what cabin a passenger stayed in if they were not around to tell the tale?\nThe \"Age\" category also contained a number of missing values, but it was not excluded from the Titanic data frame, since total deletion of this category would implicate in a significant loss of data. Instead, a histogram was contructed in order to discover what was the mean age of the passengers, which stayed between 20 and 30. A mean value of 27 was chosen and then the missing values in the \"Age\" category were filled with this central value, since a value of zero was not possible in this case.\nIn addition to the categories \"Age\" and \"Cabin\", the column \"Embarked\" also showed two missing values. Since the amount of missing values in this category was considerably low, they were replaced by the mode or most common value in the column, which was port of entry \"S\". The mode was chosen because it is a good central measurement to be used for nominal variables.","metadata":{}}]}

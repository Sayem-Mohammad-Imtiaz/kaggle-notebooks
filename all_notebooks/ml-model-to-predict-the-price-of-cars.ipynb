At this stage, I knew that the dependent variable is the price or MSRP and the independent variables are all variables excluding MSRP in my data set. The reason for this is I could see a pattern in my dataset. For example, if the engine size of the car was high then the price of the car was high and the same refers to Horsepower, Cylinders, Length, Wheelbase and many more.

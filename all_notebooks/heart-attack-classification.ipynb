I know that many of you want to make their Machine Learning model directly without doing all of this work, but please be a little patient as these steps are also important. If you feed trash into your ML model it will produce nothing but thrash! And so, almost all of the time, you have to perform these steps to clean your data before making your machine learning model.

Analysing the Model\n\n#### We can use confusion matrix, AUC ROC curve, MSE, F1 score, etc. for analyzing the model. Each one of them is suited for a specific purpose. We have to decide which one of them to be used, but generally, we can use AUC ROC curve for most of the cases unless explicitly mentioned. \n\n#### For now, you can understand about AUC ROC curve that, more the area under the curve better is the model. You can read more about that [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/06/auc-roc-curve-machine-learning/).\n\n![AUC ROC curve](https://glassboxmedicine.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/roc-curve-v2.png?w=576)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_auc_roc(model):\n    probs = model.predict_proba(X_test)\n    preds = probs[:,1]\n    fpr, tpr, threshold = metrics.roc_curve(y_test, preds)\n    roc_auc = metrics.auc(fpr, tpr)\n\n    # method I: plt\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')\n    plt.plot(fpr, tpr, 'b', label = 'AUC = %0.2f' % roc_auc)\n    plt.legend(loc = 'lower right')\n    plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1],'r--')\n    plt.xlim([0, 1])\n    plt.ylim([0, 1])\n    plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\n    plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\n    plt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T17:27:15.220632Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T17:27:15.220977Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T17:27:15.227543Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T17:27:15.220937Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T17:27:15.226762Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# for Logistic Regression\nplot_auc_roc(log_reg)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T17:27:47.600238Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T17:27:47.600586Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T17:27:47.746521Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T17:27:47.600551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T17:27:47.745743Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# for Decision Tree\nplot_auc_roc(tree)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-03T17:28:19.905564Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-03T17:28:19.905898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-03T17:28:20.045198Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-03T17:28:19.905854Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-03T17:28:20.044368Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**PLEASE UPVOTE GUYS AND RECOMMEND THAT SHOULD IMPLEMENT**","metadata":{}}]}

You can clearly see a great number of correlations between some of the different value streams.\n\nGenerally speaking, females do better than males, with the exception of Maths, where males slightly excel. \n\nOut of the ones that took the Maths test, someone taking a standard lunch was more likely to achieve a higher result whether male or female.\n\nGroup C's ethniicty values with a standard lunch meant that they were far more likely to get a higher score when compared with their writing scores.\n\nI think it goes without saying that there are very clear correlations.\n\nGender and maths test with the lunch values as a hue is a fantastic graph to point out how clear this correlation really is.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks for reading through this EDA.

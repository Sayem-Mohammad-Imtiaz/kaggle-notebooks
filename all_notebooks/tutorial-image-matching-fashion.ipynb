A simple strategy to classify the test data is to find the images that look similar to your query image (input test data). \n\n### To identify similar images, we can measure the distance between each of the pixels of 2 images (color image are just 3 layers of pixels, with each layer corresponding to Red, Green and Blue channel), and look for the image sets which are closest to each other. The images similar to our query image is known as the nearest neighbours. We can then decide the sub-category of our query image by looking at its neighbours' labels. This is a lazy-learning technique known as **K - Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**.\n\n### However, we have some constraints. Traditional KNN is computationally and memory expensive (imagine we got to store all the training images, and for each image query, we do a blind search on these training images). Thus, in this notebook, I will show you a proof of concept of image matching using **Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN)** instead, which is theoretically faster with decent search accuracy. I will use **[Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)** package for the ANN, because it is **~~annoying~~** straight forward to use.\n\n### As for the dataset, I will use the **[Fashion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/burn874/fashionfull)** which is kindly prepared and shared by **[Chua Cheng Hong](https://www.kaggle.com/burn874)**.

Specifically, we confirmed that there was a general positive trend between total student enrollment and incidence of crime. However, we saw that this did not explain all of the data. There was quite a bit of variance in the enrollment versus incidence of crime trend line. This variance can be attributed to several outliers. When we identified the campuses that were outliers, we found that they were all University of California campuses (which tended to have a higher overall incidence of crime). UC Berkeley and UCLA have the highest rates of crime (both total and per capita) of any campus, but UC Hastings and UC San Francisco, both small campuses located in large metropolitan areas, had unusually high per-capita rates of crime.\n\nThere also does not appear to be a trend between the number of per-capita law enforcement employees and the per-capita incidence of crime, nor does it appear to be dependent on the makeup of the law enforcement agency (whether it is civilian-heavy or officer-heavy).\n\nIn some sense, these findings are no surprise - we would expect, going in, that UC Hastings, located in a bad neighborhood in a big city, would have a higher rate of crime per student than other campuses. But the data did give us a breakdown between violent and property crime, which showed significant differences between crime at UC San Francisco and UC Hastings. \n\nPerhaps the most important observation here is that the campus data sets are *incomplete*. While the size of the campus gives a strong indication of the level of crime, this approach leads to multiple outliers. To properly describe (or predict) these outliers with a model requires data *not* contained in the data set - the crime rate of the surrounding neighborhood and city. The crime rates cannot be effectively described using campus size (too many outliers) or number of law enforcement officers (not significant)."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

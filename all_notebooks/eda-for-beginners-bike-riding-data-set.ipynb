Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. \n\nApart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f414c12daca37bbffff07236556b79621512b067"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Attribute Information\nBoth hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv\n\n- instant: record index\n- dteday : date\n- season : season (1:springer, 2:summer, 3:fall, 4:winter)\n- yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)\n- mnth : month ( 1 to 12)\n- hr : hour (0 to 23)\n- holiday : weather day is holiday or not (extracted from [Web Link])\n- weekday : day of the week\n- workingday : if day is neither weekend nor holiday is 1, otherwise is 0.\n+ weathersit : \n- 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy\n- 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n- 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n- 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n- temp : Normalized temperature in Celsius.

The first boxplot shows us how the bike-rentals per hour are distributed over the hours of the day. For example if on the 5th of July 2011 200 bikes were rented between 10 and 11 p.m, one point is drawn with the coordinates x = 22 and y = 200. This is done for every day and every hour. Because so many points would confuse us, the boxes show us there the quantiles are and the line in the middle shows the mean, only outliers are visible as a point.\nWe see that during the rush hour (around hour 8 and 17), we have higher means and higher variance.

We have just theories no facts and we were just looking at two years. \n\nWe found out that registered and casual users behaved differently, so it's likely that they are to completely different groups. It's probable that the registered users use the bike mainly for transportation (e.g. go to work) and the casual users use it for leisure (making tours or sightseeing). This theory would explain a lot we had observed. You remember that the increasing trend is mostly caused by the registered user? Our new theory could explain that. The registered users need time to increasing, since they must change their habits. They first have to register, then perhaps sell their car or own bike. It could also be that they have monthly or yearly tickets for public transportation and just want to wait till those expire. Make a long story short the casual users can be more spontaneous. Tourists planning to go to Washington Monument or lovers wanting to cycle through Rock Creek Park just take a bike and start their trip. We can also assume that spontaneous trips are made on holidays or during vacation so the weather has a greater impact on their behaviour. During a hurricane, your partner really must be Mrs./Mr. Right, when you go cycling in the park (please have a look on the casual column at 2012-10-29 an congratulate them💕), also think of day tourists here, they come perhaps for a weekend and decide what they want to do, depending on the weather. On the other side the poor registered users have to go to work no matter if it's raining or not. We also wondered why the impact of the weather on weekends is less than on holidays. An explanation could be that the registered users, also have fixed dates on the weekend (sports, brunch, church etc.)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

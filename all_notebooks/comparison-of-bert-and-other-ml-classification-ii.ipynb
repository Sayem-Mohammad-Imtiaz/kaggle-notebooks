To do this, it was useful for fine-tuning some of these algorithms to use search grid techniques using cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model.\n\nBERT and DistilBERT are to be preferred when we would like to push performance to its maximum and to optimize the avoidance of True Positive misclassification (given by the recall score).\n\nHowever, even these algorithms are the best according to the scores, we can still apply Okhalm's razor principle.

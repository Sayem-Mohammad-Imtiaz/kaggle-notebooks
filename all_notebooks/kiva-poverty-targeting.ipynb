What is Kiva?\nKiva is an organization which connects risk-tolerant lenders and their capital to people in poor areas with difficulty accessing credit.  Loans are crowdsourced in increments of $25 and disbursed by field partners, expected to generally be at market or below market interest rates.  The Kiva lending user is directly paid back from the associated loan and thus can be thought of as crowdfunding the purchase of a loan a borrower has requested.\n<a id=2></a>\n# 2. Notes On Kiva for Relieving Poverty\nI am a fan and happy user/lender of Kiva; although it should also be noted that Kiva cannot work miracles.  Much of poverty reduction comes from state supported initiatives, such as providing security for people and property so that markets can function and flourish.  Kiva has one lever to pull and that lever does not address things like a corrupt state or resolve violent conflicts.  Kiva's largest impact will be from directing it's risk tolerant capital provided by its users into the hands of borrowers who have difficulty accessing basic banking functions to securely save money or to borrow at fair market rates.  The ideal case for a standard Kiva loan is likely to an entrepeneur who would otherwise seek a local black market/mafia type money lender who would charge much higher rates.\n\nKiva results also can be difficult to measure.  We're not going to observe something at a high level aggregate (like GDP for a region) because there are many other factors going on, but mostly for the simple reason that there is not enough Kiva loan activity going on to observe results at such a high aggregate level.  Per [Section 11 of my first Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/doyouevendata/kiva-exploration-by-a-kiva-lender-and-python-newb), El Salvador (easily) would be the country with the most observable impact at the nation state level;\n![](https://www.doyouevendata.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/11.png)\n\nHowever, note that they have about 6,250 loans per million residents.  That's 6.25 people with Kiva capital provided loans per 1,000 people.  That's not going to goose a GDP number, GINI coefficient, MPI metric, or any other nation state aggregate.  Also, all loans are not equally helpful or impactful; it was amusing to find in [Tim W's Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/timosdk/exploring-motivations-for-kiva-loans/notebook) that he found mutliple people in Peru requesting loans for $600-1200+ stereo systems.  This is certainly more than some of my friends are willing to spend on a kickin' stereo.  It is certainly different than a loan for a store to expand their inventory, or a farmer to purchase some pigs, or for someone to purchase their own toilet.\n\nSince the country level aggregates are not great for measuring the problems Kiva is trying to tackle, they are best off trying to go regional or local, as much as possible.  The GDP effects are not observable, although what is observable is how difficult life in areas is and how Kiva addressing lack of credit and capital may offer some relief.  The more able Kiva is able to understand a locality the better it is able to address its needs and work with its field partners to do so."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c12bb380-ee75-4033-93f9-7f764ebe4cf9","_uuid":"adab5bbfb094c2f8a6e27e987552d557ca68df62"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=3></a>\n# 3. Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MPI)\nMPI is a poverty metric measuring multiple dimensions and intensity of poverty in an area.  It is provided at the National level, and in some countries, at a Sub-National level.  This Sub-National level is at the top most administrative regions level for countries.  A higher value MPI is worse.  Rural areas have higher values than urban ones.\n\n![](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/mpi.png)\n\nKiva is leveraging the MPI in evaluating countries, field partners, and themes.  How is outlined in [Annalie's kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/annalie/kivampi) for Field Partner MPI calculated with both National MPI and Sub-National MPI.  Elliot [has a follow up](https://www.kaggle.com/elliottc/kivampi) building on this which also includes similar logic for loan themes.  Comparing National vs. Sub-National resulted in the following:\n\n![](https://www.doyouevendata.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/natreg.gif)\n\nThese look pretty similar, with the thought being that the Sub-National is an improvement in granularity in understanding the loan themes at a more local level.  I think this is the case, although this may be in part due to some National values being inherited and we also may be looking at too high level a plot here to recognize the more meaningful differences that result when we look at the indivial loan themes or field partners.  Looking at either may yield different results; I focued on field partners in my initial kernel and will repeat some of that work here.\n<a id=3_1></a>\n## 3.1 National MPI Based Calculations\n\nHere's the results of the Mozambique field partner calculations as currently done.  The reason I find these calculations questionable has to do with the rural_pct.  Rural percentage is a field partner level attribute.  Note the pretty large difference between MPI Rural and MPI Urban here; rural is pretty high at 0.48.  Urban is at 0.189.  These are *National* values which get weighted into the Partner ID MPI Score, based on the rural percentage."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_cell_guid":"401dd430-efda-48fe-83c8-af5a2dbc62c7","_uuid":"b4ba1177504e58327c6fa46081902a967c3bc811","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"LT = pd.read_csv(\"../input/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding/loan_themes_by_region.csv\") #.set_index([''])\nMPI = pd.read_csv(\"../input/mpi/MPI_national.csv\")[['ISO','MPI Urban','MPI Rural']].set_index(\"ISO\")\nLT = LT.join(MPI,how='left',on=\"ISO\")[['Partner ID','Field Partner Name','ISO','MPI Rural','MPI Urban','rural_pct','amount', 'mpi_region']].dropna()\n\nLT['rural_pct'] /= 100\n#~ Compute the MPI Score for each loan theme\nLT['MPI Score'] = LT['rural_pct']*LT['MPI Rural'] + (1-LT['rural_pct'])*LT['MPI Urban']\n\nLT[LT['ISO'] == 'MOZ'][['Partner ID', 'ISO', 'MPI Rural', 'MPI Urban', 'rural_pct', 'MPI Score']].drop_duplicates()","execution_count":44,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"c7e7555b-29d8-44b7-b741-3db8663ea952","_uuid":"ef51db06b5bdf1d3aa8bd9d99fd0da042bbbd009"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The big difference in the partners above is entirely due to the rural percentage of 85 vs. 20%.

However, not all countries have this region level data.  For those that do not, Kiva inherits the National MPI as noted above.  I think this has two problems as well;\n1. As noted above, National MPI as presently calculated does not seem particularly trustworthy.\n2. This seems like a significant mixing of methodology; one with hard MPI provided regional numbers, and one with pretty soft appearing field partner rural percentages.  Can we expect fair peer comparisons when mixing such different methodologies?

I am going to do it with one method using geospatial objects that appears to work reasonably well.  For this I am going to use the data provided in the [All Kiva Challenge Loan Location Coordinates](https://www.kaggle.com/mithrillion/kiva-challenge-coordinates) dataset provided by [Mithrillion](https://www.kaggle.com/mithrillion).  [Beluga](https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor) also has an excellent dataset containing [even more loans and their locations](https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor/additional-kiva-snapshot), however I was not sure how well it would tie in to the challenge snapshot of field partners and their aggregate metrics.  It would also be much more time to run this method for significantly more loans.\n\nWe will determine in which region a location lies by using geopandas and geodataframes.  We will have a location (point) and determine which region (polygon) it is in.  There is a spatial join which likely works much better than the code I have been using, [however it does not appear that it will be available any time soon](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/53008) and I'm unsure how to add it myself.  We'll use this methodology with the aggregate field partner numbers in the loan theme regions input as was done for the existing Sub-National methodology.  The geospatial regions are actually at a lower district level, so we'll have to combine them into larger polygons at our MPI regional level.  In the next section, we'll run these numbers for the actual loans in our challenge set of loans.

Kenya has had a lot of redistricting, which can be [read about on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Counties_of_Kenya).  Since 2013 they've had 47 counties.  MPI reports data for 8 regions; these were provinces in Kenya, also dissolved in 2013.  We'll need to stitch together the geospatial counties into these dissolved regions to properly plot our points in polygons and associate them with MPI.

Note again the KDE plot in [Section 3](#3) hides the fact that the differences in the presence of both can be quite dramatic, and for that matter, many partners are simply lost under the National based calculation.  The KDE map might not match as well, but the data is missing so it appears more closely correlated than it really likely is.\n4. Comparing green (existing Sub-National region partner based MPI) to red (amended mpi_region Sub-National region partner based MPI) we can see some partners with little change, and some with quite significant changes.  I believe the amended red is an improvement in accuracy.\n5. The next and last mpi_region located amended calculations are not done at the region partner level, but are both accounted for by the location on the actual atomic loans in the Kiva challenge set.  Thus they are the most accurate representation of the data provided.  The purple line takes the mean of the regional MPI number, while the mustard color takes a funded_amount weighted calcuation of regional MPI.  These do produce different numbers, a particularly large amount in the case of partner 491.\n\n\nI would argue the Field Partner MPI increases in accuracy going from methodologies left to right, ans that the most accurately calculated Field Partner MPI is that in mustard, which uses the base loans, updated mpi_region values, and takes a funded_amount weighted calculation across all the loans and regions a field partner has disbursed funds to."},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"abd87412-825f-4806-82aa-6b68b49a3cde","_uuid":"a58a7d323143a1605daeb102b94917da097e381f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=4_2></a>\n## 4.2 Kenya FGT Analysis\nAs noted above in [Section 2](#2), understanding poverty at a more local level is of interest to Kiva in understanding its borrowers' situations.  The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics provided the [2015/16 Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS)](https://www.knbs.or.ke/launch-201516-kenya-integrated-household-budget-survey-kihbs-reports-2/), from which I have [uploaded a dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/doyouevendata/kenya-poverty-metrics-by-district).  It includes food poverty, overall poverty, and a \"hardcore\" poverty set of tables, at the 47 county level for Kenya.  Let's place our loans into these counties and take a look at what we can see.\n\nThis set uses [Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%E2%80%93Greer%E2%80%93Thorbecke_indices), which includes\n1. **Headcount Rate** - the proportion of the population that cannot afford the basic basket of goods as measured by a predetermined threshold.\n2. **Poverty Gap** - the poverty gap index/depth of poverty provides information on how much poorer the poor people are relative to the poverty line.\n3. **Severity of Poverty** - index that tries to take into account both of the above.\n\nFurthermore, it is provided across three levels;\n1. **Food Poverty**: Households & individuals whose monthly adult equivalent food consumption expenditure per person is less than KSh 1,954 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh 2,551 in core-urban areas\n2. **Overall Poverty**: Households & individuals whose monthly adult equivalent total consumption expenditure per person is less than KSh 3,252 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh 5,995 in core-urban areas\n3. **Hardcore or Extreme Poverty**: Households & individuals whose monthly adult equivalent total consumption expenditure per person is less than KSh 1,954 in rural and peri-urban areas and less than KSh 2,551 in

Gibraltar has the smallest population of the group, with a 2019 sensus from the World Bank recording a population of 33,701. Considering this country has both the lowest population and highest percentage of vaccinations, it is not difficult to predict that Gibraltar will fully vaccinate its population before the others in the manipulated dataset. \n\nIn addition, Gibraltar shows an average of 606 vaccinations daily. With the continuation of these numbers, their population will likely reach full immunity by:\n\nPopulation (33,701) minus People Vaccinated (28,932) = 4,769 [people not vaccinated]\n\nUnvaccinated (4,769) divided by Daily Vaccinations (606)  = 7.8 [days till full immunity]\n\n> Are there any limitations in the original dataset? \n\nIt would have been notably helpful if the dataset included the populations of each country in a column as comparison to the columns indicating vaccination numbers. The dataset does not include an addition column to compare COVID-19 cases which would have made querie answering much easier. \n\n> Data trends and patterns:\n\nThe selected countries show that nations with smaller populations as a result have a higher percentage of vaccination per hundred. This may be because of the prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccine rollout to countries with a higher ratio of infected to healthy. In this case, Gibraltars population is approximately 33,701 and they have had a total of 4,263 cases which accounts for 12.65% of their country. \n\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Dicuss about the way that the national government of the country is addressing the issue by summarizing from the news.\n\nThe Egyptian government implemented a national lockdown and social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19 starting in March 2020. The highest level of central government were responsible for executing the country's policy and institutional response, which was coordinated through the Higher Committee to Combat Coronavirus chaired by the prime minister. The Ministry of Health and Population has played a key role in overseeing the government's ongoing health response, releasing daily briefings on total confirmed cases, recoveries, and death rates across the country. Other state organizations, including the armed forces and state enterprises, have been mobilized to support the governement's response ot the crisis. \n    \nThe government rapidly launched an online portal through the Crisis Management Unit within the Cabinet’s Information and Decision Support Center, which publishes and communicates a wide array of COVID-19-related information to the public through various media channels. The government launched a 24-hour hotline and a smartphone application to enable general access to resources and information on COVID-19. More recently, testing capacity—a challenge in the early months of the outbreak—has been expanded to include 57 laboratories nationwide, as well as mobile drive-through testing facilities. Moreover, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development has launched an online COVID-19 policy tracker, which provides an interactive platform with details on the 432 COVID-19 policy response measures implemented by 77 government entities to date.\n\nEgypt’s ongoing Economic Transformation Program has been credited with facilitating the government’s accelerated spending on the health sector response, as well as the various economic support measures and programs put in place since the start of the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund revised its initial real gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for Egypt’s 2020 fiscal year from 2.0 percent to 3.55 percent – higher than all Middle East and Central Asia economies and among the few countries globally with a positive growth rate. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic and anticipated measures to contain a second wave of infections, the country is expected to grow by 2.75 percent in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

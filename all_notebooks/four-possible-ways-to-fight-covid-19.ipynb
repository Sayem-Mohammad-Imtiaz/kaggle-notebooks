Even if it fumbled in the early stage, it still has sufficient strategic resources and depth. Personally, I think the United States is unlikely to experience a complete medical collapse. The biggest problem is that the federal mobilization capacity is not strong enough, and the eastern region may soon fall. However, this is only discussed from the perspective of ICU beds. If we consider that there are more flowers in the United States, the shortage of medical staff and senior management have not yet made up their minds to comprehensively prevent and control, I think that when the cumulative breakthrough exceeds 300,000 (expected in mid-April) It can be very dangerous elsewhere."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**6.3 World Bank Indicator Analysis**\n\nIn 6.1 and 6.2 we used the case fatality rate and ICU beds to analyze the ability of each country to directly combat COVID-19.\n* However, it is clear that this method has limitations.

You have to wear a mask!**\n* According to current statistical data, countries that promote the wearing of national masks, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau), have effectively controlled the exponential increase in the number of people infected within 14 days of the outbreak. And major countries that have not recommended nationals to wear masks, including Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Spain, Italy and other major Western countries have failed to control the exponential increase in the number of people infected within 14 days of the outbreak.\nAlthough this data is more directly related to different policies in various countries, what you can do as an individual is to wear a mask to protect yourself and protect others."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.The most dangerous country right now is Spain (as of March 27) rather than Italy**\n* Spain's total population is more than 46 million, and this figure is significantly less than that of Hubei Province's 59.17 million. But at present, Spain has accumulated more than 64,000 confirmed diagnoses, which is very close to the cumulative number of more than 67,000 diagnosed in Hubei Province.\n* What's more, the number of confirmed diagnoses in Spain is still growing rapidly, and according to the analysis above, we can see that the growth rate of infection rate per 10,000 people in Spain is the fastest of all major countries, much faster than France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. At present, about 8,000 people are added in a single day, and there is no sign of an inflection point in the short term. Spain currently has a case fatality rate of 7.58%, second only to Italy, San Marino, Iraq and Indonesia.\n* The current situation in Spain is even more serious than in Hubei! During the worst of the epidemic, Hubei, China with 1.4 billion people, gave its full support. Who can Spain rely on? EU?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**3. U.S. epidemic situation is not optimistic**\n* Data as of March 28, the total number of diagnoses in the United States was 124,464, the number of newly confirmed cases was 19803, the total number of deaths was 2,191, and the mortality rate was 1.76%. The total detection was 73.5w, and the detection ratio was about 16%. More outbreaks next week have become inevitable. New York may enter the high platform area next week or next week, and the medical system will be under pressure across the board. According to a comparative analysis of Spain, France, Britain, and Germany, the key to whether the outbreak can be reduced is in these two weeks. \n* Although the medical strength and the number of ICCU beds per capita in the United States are the best in the world, the paper strength to cope with COVID-19 is the strongest in the world. But the current growth situation is likely to be similar to that of Spain. If the epidemic is allowed to spread, medical resource runs will still be inevitable.\n* Michigan (Detroit), Massachusetts (Boston), Florida, and Illinois (Chicago) are the most likely new tipping points. At that time, the growth rate of new cases in the United States will be three to four times the current rate. Now it is necessary to rationally allocate medical resources across the United States, increase production capacity, try to avoid humanitarian disasters caused by the run-up of medical resources, and avoid repeating the situation in Wuhan, Madrid and Lombardy, especially in Detroit and parts of Chicago. If the growth rate is between Spain and France, the number of infected people will inevitably exceed 1 million, and the medical system will collapse like Spain and Italy.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**4. It is difficult for most European countries to avoid the situation like Italy. Although it is difficult for us to fight against COVID-19 as effectively as Germany and Switzerland, we can simply avoid Spain by several means.**\n* Protect the elderly. Because in many countries the number of new coronavirus tests is still insufficient, people only know the average age of confirmed cases. However, there are many young people who develop new coronary pneumonia, and they are basically asymptomatic or mild. The average age of confirmed cases in Italy is much higher than in other countries, including Germany. German population researcher Andreas Backhaus said in a tweet earlier this week that \"the average age of German patients is 45 years, and the average age of Italian patients is 63 years. Robert Koch- Institut classifies people over the age of 60 into the elderly group, not over 70. Even so, Germany's elderly infection group is far below the Italian level: as of early this week, only 19% of confirmed cases in Germany were over 60 years old. More than half of the diagnosed cases are 35-59 years old. In Germany, aging is actually worse than in Italy. However, the lifestyles of the two countries are very different. Italian family members have close relationships, and the elderly have a wide social relationship. At the age of 64, the Germans are relatively alienated between generations. The average age of infection is 46. Young people are mainly infected, so the mortality rate is much lower. In China, they established a square cabin hospital to treat young mildly infected Get together to heal and prevent them from infecting their elderly family members.\n* Fully tested. The number of tests is different. According to the analysis of the age of confirmed cases in various countries, we can also see the test situation in each country. If more young people are infected in Italy, the mortality rate may look very different. If the development of a country's epidemic is more severe, it will be more difficult for that country to detect more people. Because the country's health department is overwhelmed by the outbreak alone. In Germany, a comprehensive screening test was carried out very early, and the detection volume reached 15,000 / day at the end of January. Not only has drive through, but you can also send samples to the corresponding laboratory for testing. No doctor's order is required, and a large number of mild patients have been tested in time. . In China, statistics show that by mid-March, the Chinese government had tested 14 million samples.\n* Coordinating and preparing sufficient materials, you are the EU! The better the hospital is prepared for the epidemic, the more people will have a chance to be cured. This is obvious. When severe medical runs occur, there is simply no way for people to get proper treatment, or whether they can be treated in intensive care when their conditions change dramatically. Germany has invested in national health care forces for a long time. Italy has about 60 million people. Before the outbreak, according to official statistics, there were 5,000 intensive care beds. During the epidemic, additional intensive care beds were added. There are about 80 million people in Germany and 28,000 intensive care beds. At the same time, there are 28,000 intensive care units equipped with respirators in Germany, and only 7,000 in Italy. In total, China has dispatched more than 40,000 medical staff to support Wuhan. Considering that they are factories in the world, the availability of materials is also an important reason for China's victory over COVID-19. If Europe can, like China, set up a medical team in each country and travel to different countries to support the epidemic situation in each country, it will be able to effectively use the ventilator and medical staff and use the time difference to defeat COVID-19.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**5. There are too few nucleic acid tests in Japan and the United Kingdom. Failure to treat patients in time may lead to outbreaks in these two countries as severe as in the early days of Wuhan.**\n* The data in the United Kingdom is relatively easy to analyze. The increase in the number of diagnoses and infection rates is close to that in most European countries, but the number of deaths is much higher than the number of cures, which indicates that a large number of mild patients in the United Kingdom have not been diagnosed. Considering that the \"herd immunization\" strategy adopted by the British government some time ago has caused the Prime Minister and the Crown Prince to be infected, it is difficult to believe that the growth trend of the number of confirmed diagnoses in the UK can be changed rapidly after the British government changes its policy. Taking into account the increase in mortality in the UK (the initial growth rate is second only to Spain) and similar per capita medical conditions as Italy and Spain (a larger gap than France and Germany), it is difficult to say that the UK epidemic will develop in a week. Like Spain today.\n* Japanese data is very difficult to analyze:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.   Good hygiene habits of citizens across the country: have a good custom of wearing masks; meal-sharing system; national character of \"no trouble to others\"; social distance; May be the experience of coping with SARS.

Powerful medical resources: According to the analysis of 6.2 and 6.3, the data of ICU beds per capita, number of ECMOs per capita, number of ventilators per capita, scientific research capabilities, and medical care capabilities are among the highest in the world.\n1.  No super-infection incident: Although there was the Diamond Princess incident, there were no super-infection incidents like the Korean cult gathering and the 30th patient in Italy, which delayed the outbreak to a certain extent.\n1. The world's number one aging rate: The number of aging people in the country is the world's largest. According to the available data, we already know that the aging population is very vulnerable to COVID-19.\n1.  Extremely low nucleic acid detection: The conditions for setting nucleic acid detection in Japan are very harsh, and the daily detection amount does not exceed 1,000 cases.\n1. There is a problem with the mortality data: Japan's disease mortality rate is currently 72/472, which is ten times the death rate of the Diamond Princess passenger infected 12/602. Considering that most of the passengers on the Diamond Princess are elderly, the mortality gap is even larger. This seems to indicate that the number of infections in Japan may be nearly ten times higher than the number of infections currently announced."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Based on the above three favorable factors and three unfavorable factors, we can infer that the outbreak in Japan has **indeed been postponed**. Even if we speculate that the Japanese government masked the number of infections by restricting nucleic acid tests, similar to Spain, Italy, and Wuhan, outbreaks of this magnitude cannot be masked.\n* However, it must be mentioned that **delaying the epidemic does not mean that the epidemic will not erupt**. Considering Japan's aging level and the virus has spread throughout Japan during the delay period, once the outbreak will be a full-scale outbreak across the country, the number of infections and mortality will be even worse than in Spain. The Japanese government now needs to use this delay period quickly to prepare for the outbreak. Whether as a student who will go to Waseda University for exchange in the next semester , or as an individual who is also a human being, I hope that the Japanese government can effectively respond to the epidemic and reduce the death toll."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

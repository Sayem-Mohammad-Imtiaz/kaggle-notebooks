According to the results, we can use his model to simulate sales.\n2. It shows good results for Classic Cars. Ships and Planes more or less fine, except of peak values. However, we didn't use any specific logic for Classic Cars. Hence, we can get opposite results if we continue to simulate sales.\n3. We used various products and years, to be sure that we covered all cases.\n4. This approach can be used for statistical purposes only, because numbers are random.\n5. This approach doesn't take into consideration any side factors which can impact sales (seasonality, natural disasters, etc.) and works with historical data only."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

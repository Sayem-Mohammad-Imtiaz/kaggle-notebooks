Less over time? Describe these customers.\n### Of those customers who are spending more over time, which categories are growing at a faster rate?\n\n### To answer these questions we will use the four of the files provided:\n        1. transaction data\n        2. hh_demographic\n        3. campaign_table\n        4. campaign_desc\n        \n## Notebook Structure\n\n1. The notebook will look at households that the dataset provides transaction and demographic data for. \n\n2. From there we will breakout the households out by age groups and income group. \n\n3. Plot Average Weekly Spending for all age and income groups.\n\n4. Plot Average Weekly Spending for a specific demographic group: Age Group (15-34) and Income Group 50-74K. \n\n5. Chart the spending patterns of two specific households during the active adveristing campaigns.\n\n6. How do you define a successful campaign? Increase customer spending? Or increased customer visit?

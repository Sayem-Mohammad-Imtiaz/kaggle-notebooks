Women not only are hired in lower numbers than men are; they also leave tech at more than twice the rate men do. It’s not hard to see why. Studies show that women who work in tech are interrupted in meetings more often than men. They are evaluated on their personality in a way that men are not. They are less likely to get funding from venture capitalists, who, studies also show, find pitches delivered by men—especially handsome men—more persuasive. And in a particularly cruel irony, women’s contributions to open-source software are accepted more often than men’s are, but only if their gender is unknown.\n\nIn short there are social issues in the world of technology, and I intend to address the gender gap issue by exploring the top 23 silicon valley gender data sets during 2016. \n\n\n\n## **The Data** \n\nThere are six columns in this dataset:\n\n**company:** Company name\n\n**year:** For now, 2016 only\n\n**race:** Possible values: \"American_Indian_Alaskan_Native\", \"Asian\", \"Black_or_African_American\", \"Latino\", \"Native_Hawaiian_or_Pacific_Islander\", \"Two_or_more_races\", \"White\", \"Overall_totals\"\n\n**gender:** Possible values: \"male\", \"female\". Non-binary gender is not counted in EEO-1 reports.\n\n**job_category:** Possible values: \"Administrative support\", \"Craft workers\", \"Executive/Senior officials & Mgrs\", \"First/Mid officials & Mgrs\", \"laborers and helpers\", \"operatives\", \"Professionals\", \"Sales workers\", \"Service workers\", \"Technicians\", \"Previous_totals\", \"Totals\"\n\n**count:** Mostly integer values, but contains \"na\" for a no-data variable.\n\n## Plotly and SNS Visulizations\n\nThis will also be a crash course using one of the emerging data visualation libraries [Plotly](https://plot.ly/). Be prepared to learn about these 3 types of techniques: \n* Pie Charts\n* Bar Graphs Vertical and Horizontal\n* Multivariate Bar Graphs\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2e4e9094caeb5c3e1cae4dfaf5c9d2a942230225"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Steps to Success\n### Step 1 | Create our gender data frame\n### Step 2 | Remove impossible values from count column\n### Step 3 | Total employee count\n### Step 4 | Bar graph with sns plot of total employee count\n### Step 5 | Exploring gender data with plotly pie charts :)\n### Step 6 | Multivariate Bar Chart with Plotly\n### Step 7 | Male to Female Ratios Calculation\n### Step 8 | Visualize the Female to Male Ratio\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8817150b-85ff-4352-8901-25994a0763b6","_uuid":"1d94d2afc22b882fcadb79c9d210a3c9f24b280b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load in Libraries"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"40e41c35-6a91-43eb-963e-09cedb48b120","_uuid":"043e8f4ad760a00603cbb15181cc6a2a5a6927a5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport missingno as msno\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly import tools\nfrom plotly.graph_objs import *\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot, init_notebook_mode\ninit_notebook_mode()","execution_count":110,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"29cf322e-494a-4daa-9207-a4bb4167dd75","_uuid":"d66a3f0e6fe40cd1b2b0651d545efac1941018b0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- toc -->\n# Step 1 | Create our gender data frame\n* Read the csv data into our gender data frame\n* Preview Data by looking at the head of the data frame"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e470d0a6-1318-42a1-be97-82563d12263d","_uuid":"c7376adffda52c67c7c65f23e85080d81b524a68","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"gender_data=pd.read_csv('../input/Reveal_EEO1_for_2016.csv')\ngender_data.head()","execution_count":111,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0a88d2e8-7b3d-4ff4-89b2-8b70cc84b03a","_uuid":"00232925d3ec0adf8921b90972f12af361d1c0ba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 2 | Remove Impossible Values\n* Convert the count column into an numeric type. \n* Replace all na values in the count column to 0 (can't do math if we have na text involved :) ) "},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f093b331-f440-409f-b76a-6cc4ee992f33","_uuid":"31ccb3cfb3b3788a193cbcf584c1026de44618dd","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"gender_data['count'].replace(to_replace='na',value=0,inplace=True)\ngender_data['count']=gender_data['count'].astype(int)\ngender_data.head()","execution_count":112,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7f65eb35-9e00-41a4-8ade-78bee26c9121","_uuid":"003c110fcd6a0dd04c095245bcfe017a39f2894f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 3 | Total employee Count\nHow many people works for the top 15 silicon valley companies in the bay.

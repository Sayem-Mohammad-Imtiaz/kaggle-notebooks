What age on average is a normal players' \"prime\"? What about an all star player? \n* At what height and weight do players score the most points on average? \n* What countries' players perform the best? \n* What draft class from 1996 to 2019 performed the best? \n* With the advancement of 3 point shooting and efficient scoring, how are star players points per game being affected? \n\n\n**Data Profile**\n\nThe data set features multiple entities that may be extracted. For example, height, weight, player name, college, country, points per game, rebounds per game etc. Most of the data I decide to extract will depend on the questions I hope to answer.\n\nSome possible limitations of using the data is that some of the data contains strings and integers in the same columns. For example, some players were undrafted instead of given a draft position (1, 2, 34, 29 etc.). This isnt necessarily a limitation but it does remind me that I have to be careful with converting the data when I do my analysis.

The data can be skewed to look like this as there are only a few players in those countries and they just happened to be high scoring players. Since there are so many players from the USA, the average is lower because we are factoring in low scoring players. Virgin Islands is also very high because the dataset has a typo error in which there are two. One includes Tim Duncan which is a high scoring and high rebounding player.\n\nIf we take a look at rebounds, we can see that Congo and  is very high. This is because a lot of Centers and Power Forwards are from the Congo. Such as Dikembe Mutombo. \n\nTaking a look at assists, we see that Spain is the highest. This may be because of players such as Jose Calderon and Ricky Rubio which are well-known as Spanish point guards with great passing ability.

Being an NBA fan, I was able to compare different relationships such as players points per game and how it changes out of their prime. I was also able to relate certain outcomes to my knowledge of the NBA. The challenging part of it was definitely sorting through the data to set up the plots. Once I figured out how to use functions such as \"where\" and \"groupby\", the analysis became easier to create.\n\nFuture work would consist of diving more deep into the weight and height analysis. I simply made a scatterplot showing the relationship but it is hard to tell what weight and height perform the best as there is such a large group of players with similar heights/weights. A regression analysis can also be done for the age vs pts plots, we can use it to predict a current players points per game throughout their entire career.

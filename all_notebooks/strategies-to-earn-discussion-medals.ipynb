Introduction\n\nFrom my experience I noticed that silver and gold discussion medals (5 and 10 upvotes respectively) are much harder to get compared to bronze discussion medals (1 upvote). So I began wondering **how forum messages with silver/gold medals are different from messages with bronze medals?**\n\nIn this kernel I will present my analysis and for this purpose will use a number of Python libraries:\n\n- `pandas` - working with DataFrames\n- `BeautifulSoup` and `re` - cleaning messages from HTML tags\n- `spacy` - natural language processing (NLP)\n- `TSNE` and `KMeans` from `sklearn` - dimension reduction and clustering\n- `seaborn` - visualization\n- `Counter` from `collections` - counting words\n- `bokeh` - interactive visualization"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\nimport spacy\n\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom bokeh.plotting import output_notebook, figure, show\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, Select, CustomJS\nfrom bokeh.layouts import column\nfrom bokeh.transform import factor_cmap, linear_cmap\n\noutput_notebook(hide_banner=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to use Python in Bokeh callback functions, it is also required to install the module `pscript`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pscript","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Preprocessing of forum messages\n\nBefore NLP techniques are applied to the forum messages, they need to be preprocessed. Raw messages can be uploaded from the file `ForumMessages.csv` in the [Kaggle Meta dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle). Note that this dataset is updated every day so the output will be different if you fork and run this kernel yourself. The rows with empty messages are filtered out and the rest is sorted according to `PostDate`. For the sorting to work properly, the column `PostDate` needs to be tranformed into the format `datetime`. The parameter `infer_datetime_format=True` reads the formatting from the first entry and uses it for the rest of the column, thus significantly speeding up the parser. This is especially useful for this dataset because it contains several hundred thousands of messages."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"messages = pd.read_csv('../input/ForumMessages.csv')\nmessages = messages[messages.Message.notna()]\nmessages['PostDate'] = pd.to_datetime(messages['PostDate'], infer_datetime_format=True)\nmessages = messages.sort_values('PostDate')\nmessages.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For cleaning messages from HTML tags I will be using the module `BeautifulSoup`. Calling it, however, for each individual message is very time consuming. Therefore, I create one string from all forum messages that are divided by a unique separator ` |sep| `.\n\nBefore applying `BeautifulSoup` I clean messages from the code snippets that are enclosed by the tag `<code>`. Some messages include code snippets as plain text (withoug the tag `<code>`) and can become a problem. For example, `BeautifulSoup` will consider the symbol `<-` used in R as the beginning of an HTML tag and will remove all text up to the nearest closing bracket `>`. To avoid this, the symbol `<-` is also removed in advance.\n\nAfter `BeautifulSoup` parses raw messages, one can get the text without HTML tags using the method `get_text()`.\n\nURLs and Kaggle usernames starting with @ can also be removed because they don't bring much semantic information.\n\nFinally, the string of all forum messages is split back into the list  and assigned to the DataFrame `messages`.

Vectorization and visualization of forum messages\n\nJust like in other machine learning tasks, the objects of interest should be transformed into a vector form (*vectorization*). There are many different methods of text vectorization, for example, word counts, TF-IDF, etc. In this kernel I will be using the vectorization method called *word embedding*. It encodes each word with a vector taken from a large dictionary of word-vector pairs. These dictionaries are obtained from the neural networks that were trained on a lot of documents, and can be easily found online. The big advantage of the word embedding method is that contextually similar words have similar word vectors. This approach will allow us to compare forum messages with each other."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.1.

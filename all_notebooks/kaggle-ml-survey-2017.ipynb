It's one of the primary learning tools and open data resources available online. In late 2017 they conducted a survey of its users and released the data.\n\nWhat follows is an example of exploratory data analysis (or EDA). EDA is often the first step in tackling any data science project (that is, after you have the first iteration of your question). This report was created in one of the most prominent industry tools: Juptyer Notebook. Jupyter Notebook lets you write code and Markdown (formated text like what you're reading right now) in one, streamlined document. It's quickly becoming my favorite way to code.\n\nI'll try to explain the code as best as I can as we go. Comments in the code blocks are either preceded by a hash-tag, or are surrounded by three quotes. I geared the comments in the code for a general audience. For the most part, this first big chuck of code creates some reusable functions that take certain kinds of survey questions and plot the responses.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"70ef0e97-1608-4e56-93ea-e547a71592b3","_uuid":"487bba276b48befb84229bf3746fd2a5b31eb118","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the usual packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport math\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Make graphs pretty\nsns.set()\nsns.set_palette(sns.cubehelix_palette(10, start=1.7, reverse=True))\n\n#Below are functions which I wrote to plot specific types of questions in this survey.

Or should I have the gist down enough to walk someone through it? The actual level of understanding that pertains to these various answers is debatable (e.g. to me, to be able to explain it properly requires more understanding than being able to tune the parameters or even code it from scratch, but I'm not sure if that's what the respondents meant). In general, though, the fact that I don't need to understand enough to innovate the algorithm or be able to write a blazing version gives me some hope that I learn most of this on my own.","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b5ae4217-4aa6-4cff-82b8-cd8f53d35615","_uuid":"f59d35732a1fa75ec64366cbe736130ffdc641a3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"18597e88-6a94-4b61-a5fd-283fab3010bd","_uuid":"9fb5f5b23536fd81cffd0128633e06b02adc493d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### At work, how often did you experience these barriers or challenges within the past year?","outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8b5341bb-f314-4524-8fea-159938abf2a0","_uuid":"f0cd16a0db5f095e4202c9a4901c41328b49320e","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set_palette(sns.cubehelix_palette(30, start=1.7, reverse=True))\nplot_frequency_questions(MC, 'WorkChallengeFrequency', figsize=(12,8), drop_last=6);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f54592c4-729b-42f2-a7f3-bfdc5884c6e5","_uuid":"2cf9e33fed2fd52e776d5dc42cdd559b85461222"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Out of the top eight challenges at work, only two technical, with 'Dirty Data' taking the lead by far.

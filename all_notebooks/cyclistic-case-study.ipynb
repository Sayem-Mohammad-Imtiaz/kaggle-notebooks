Chicago bike-share business.  \nThe data has been anonymized and made available for use under \n[this license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).\n\nThe data in this notebook was collected from the period of June 2020 through May 2021.  \nI recieved this data as coursework in the Google Data Analytics Certificate program.\n\n## Tools Used\n\nI've chosen to use Python to process this dataset for its ease of use and diverse functionality.  \nThe Pandas library is efficient in working with our large dataset, and the Matplotlib library allows us to create custom plots from Pandas objects.  \nThis case study was constructed in a Jupyter Notebook IDE, then manually imported onto Kaggle.\n\n## Our Task\n\nCyclistic offers nearly 6,000 bicycles that service the Chicago area with a network of approximately 700 docking stations.  \nRiders can choose between purchasing a single-ride pass, a full-day pass, or an annual membership.  \n\nAnnual memberships are much more profitable than casual riders purchasing passes.  \nOur business objective is to maximize the number of annual memberships by developing a marketing strategy which targets the conversion of casual riders into annual members.  \nOur marketing analyst team needs to know how members and casual riders are using the bikes differently.  \n\n## Importing the Data\n\nWe recieve our data as twelve CSV files, each representing a complete month of Cyclistic rides.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy

Further there are a lot of additional costs depending on the model, the millage, the fuel consumption etc.\nUsually the older the car is, the less it will be worth. For example, a new car might lose 20-30% of its value in only 1-2 years, but later the diminution might be slower. A car loses less or more value every year depending of its type.

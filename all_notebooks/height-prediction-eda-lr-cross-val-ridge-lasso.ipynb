So player_height is my target variable and other columns are my features. There might be strong correlation between player_height and player_weight - during my predictions I will consider droping player_weight column to test prediction accuracy with and without this column.\n\nAfter analysing dataset and applying linear regression models to try predict player_height target value I came to few conclusions. First of all at the beginning I thought that there's strong correlation between player_height and features like offensive, defensive rebound. As a basketball fan I always thought that biggest and tallest players usually grabs most rebounds, but after analysing dataset we can clearly see that there's very low correlation of 0.589033 for offensive rebounds and 0.614650 for defensive rebounds. Also negative correlaction value between player_height and assists was a big suprise for me. Of course biggest factor turned out to be player_weight which basically make lots of sense as statistically every human being usally gets heavier if it's taller.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Suggestions for next steps\nIn my opinion most efficient way to improve prediction score would be to add specific features that have high correlation with player_height.

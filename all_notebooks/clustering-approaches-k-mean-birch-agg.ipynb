In this document, I attempt to use various clustering techniques to identify customer “clusters” in consumer credit card data while observing how each technique handles the data set and how the results may be similar or dissimilar. This document provides a walk-thru of the data treatment and methods used to discern the number of clusters. The purpose of this analysis is to identify different customer personas in the credit card data.\n\nIn this document, I walk through an analysis of the data with a K-Means clustering approach complete with an interpretation of the data clusters. Following that analysis is a general comparison of how the K Means, Birch, and Agglomerative clustering approaches differ in their treatment of the data.\n\nThe data for this document is a public dataset of consumer credit card data published on Kaggle [1]. The dataset is accompanied by several user-submitted kernels that provide some starting points and insight for this analysis [2]. For this document, I have noted the most useful kernels in the references section of this document. My work differs in that it combines several approaches not contained in a single kernel. My treatment of the data and analysis of the results also varies significantly from any single kernel published on Kaggle. My analysis does not align with other approaches. My steps to prepare the data, identify the number of clusters and interpretations of the results will, in some cases, differ significantly. I also provide details concerning my data preparation steps not shared in the public kernels. Additionally, my treatment of the data provides a direct comparison of the output of the various clustering approaches."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data\nThe consumer credit card data consists of 8950 rows with 18 columns.

In most cases, BIRCH only requires a single scan of the database. [9]\n\nAgglomerative clustering is another form of hierarchical clustering. This approach is a form of “bottom up” clustering “…each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.[10] \n\nAll of the approaches seem to have a clear preference for 2 clusters. Based on the analysis of the K-Means results, I could see those two segments representing the extremes based (in a general sense, not the actual features) on the total spend in association with purchase frequency,  cash advances and the number and the amount of money spent on one-off purchases.\n \nWhere the results get a little more interesting is that the K-Means and BIRCH have a strong preference for several more clusters, 6 and 7 respectfully. If I were looking for more considerable variation and possibly looking for niche customers segments that are not as obvious, pursuing the analysis of 6 to 7 clusters might provide that insight.\n\nPer the snake plots it is very easy to see that all three approaches had a similar outcome and treatment of the data.

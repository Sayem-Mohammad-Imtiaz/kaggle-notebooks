However, all of these classical statistical techniques for performing a hypothesis test, were developed at a time when we had very little computing power and were simply closed-form analytical solutions for calculating a p-value,that's it! But with the added complication of needing to pick the right formula for the given situation, due to their restrictive and sometimes opaque assumptions.\n\nBut rejoice!\n\nThere is a better way. Simulation.\n\nTo understand how simulation can help us, lets remind ourselves what a hypothesis test is:\n\nWe wish to test ***“whether the observed effect in our data is real or whether it could happen simply by chance”***\nand to perform this test we do the following:\n   *  Choose an appropriate ‘test statistic’: this is simply a number that measures the observed effect. In our case we will choose the **absolute deviation in AMVR from the mean**.\n   * Construct a Null Hypothesis: this is simply a version of the data where the observed effect in not present. In our case we will shuffle the labels of the data repeatedly **permutation**. The justification for this is detailed below.\n   * Compute a p-value: this is the probability of seeing the observed effect amongst the null data, in other words, by chance. **We do this through repeated simulation** of the null data. In our case, we shuffle the ‘date’ labels of the data many times and simply count the occurrence of our test statistic as it appears through multiple simulations.\n   \n>    That’s hypothesis testing in 3 steps! No matter what phenomena we are testing, the question is always the same: “**is the observed effect real, or is it due to chance**”\n\n[There is only one test! This great blog by Allen Downey has more details on hypothesis testing](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html)\n\n**The real power of simulation is that we have to make explicit what our model assumptions are through code**.

If we had a good idea of the data distribution or simply made assumption on it, we could use ‘classical’ hypothesis testing techniques, t-test, X², one-way ANOVA etc. These models can be restrictive and something of a blackbox if their assumptions aren’t fully understood by the researcher.\n   * **Direct Simulation**. We could make assumptions about the [data generating process](http://www.rimini.unibo.it/fanelli/econometric_models2_2012.pdf) and simulate directly. For example we could specify an ARMA time series model for the financial data we are modeling and deliberately engineer it to have no seasonality. This could be a reasonable choice for our problem, however if we knew the data generating process for the S&P500 we would be rich already!\n   * **Simulation through Resampling**. This is the approach we will take. By repeatedly sampling at random from the existing dataset and shuffling the labels, we can make the observed effect equally likely amongst all labels in our data (in our case the labels are the dates), thus giving the desired null dataset.\n\nSampling is a big topic but we will focus on one particular technique, **[permutation](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/statistics-for-hackers)** or shuffling.\n\nTo get the desired null model, we need to construct a dataset that has **no seasonality** present. If the null is true, *that there is no seasonality in the data and the observed effect was simply by chance*, then the labels for each month (Jan,Feb etc) are meaningless and therefore we can shuffle the data repeatedly to build up what classical statistics would call the ‘*[sampling distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=441&v=5Dnw46eC-0o)*’. This has the desired effect of making the observed phenomena (the extreme December value) **equally likely** for all months, which is exactly what our null model requires.\n\nTo prove how powerful simulation techniques are with modern computing power, the code in this example will actually permute the daily price data, which requires lots more processing power, yet still completes in seconds on a modern CPU. \n\nNote: *shuffling either the daily or the monthly labels will give us the desired null dataset in our case.*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d882201d7aa9b434ad0306ea9da8ba5e7cb20c36"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"                              Shuffle 'date' label to create null dataset\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*-rzHR7JrlTjcXAYp4zKCUA.gif)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9e8009cef1054e28fea4694d51b4825222070af"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A great resource for learning about sampling is by [Julian Simon](http://www.resample.com/intro-text-online/).\n\nNote: *The way our test is constructed is the equivalent of a two sided test using ‘classical’ methods, such as Welch’s t-test or ANOVA etc, because we are interested in the most extreme value, either above or below the mean.*\n\nThese decisions are design choices and we have this freedom because **the Null Model is just that, it’s a Model!** This means we can specify its parameters as we choose, the key is to really be clear what question we are trying to answer.\n\nBelow is the code to simulate 1000 sets of 12 AMVR, permuting the date labels each time to build up the sampling distribution.

The top row are the probability distributions and the bottom row are the CDF. The red dashed line is the 5% significance level that we arbitrarily decided upon. The blue line is the original extreme December AMVR value of 1.23."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9acd6d477dc4aca70d651c177df957506b3e95b4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The left side plot shows that the original December value is significant at a 5% level, but only just! However, when we account for multiple comparison bias, in the right hand plot the threshold for significance moves up from around 1.2 (abs AMVR) up to around 1.6 (see the redline).\n\n>    **By accounting for multiple comparison bias our December value of 1.23 is no longer significant!**\n\nBy taking into consideration the specific question we are trying to answer and avoiding multiple comparison bias, we have avoided p-hacking our model and avoided showing a significant result when there isn’t one.\n\nTo further explore p-hacking and how it can be abused to tell a particular story about our data, see this great interactive app from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part2)\n\n### Conclusions\n\n* **We have learnt that hypothesis testing is not the big scary beast we thought it was. Simply follow the 3 steps above to construct your model for any kind of data or test statistic.**\n\n* **We’ve show that asking the right question is vital for scientific analysis. A slight change in the wording can lead to a very different model with very different results.**\n\n* **We discussed the importance of recognizing and correcting for multiple comparison bias and avoiding the pitfalls of p-hacking and showed how a seemingly significant result can become non-significant.**\n\n* **With more and more ‘big data’ along with academic pressure to produce a research paper with ‘novel’ findings or political pressure to show a result as being ‘significant’, the temptation for p-hacking is ever increasing. By learning to recongise when we are guilty of it and correcting for it accordingly we can become better researchers and ultimately produce more accurate and therefore actionable scientific results!**\n\nAuthors Notes: *Our results differ slightly from the original [Winton research](https://www.winton.com/research/seasonal-volatility-and-the-multiplicity-effect), this due in part to having a slightly different data set (32yrs vs 87yrs) and they have October being the month of interest whereas we have December. Also they used an undisclosed method for their ‘simulated data’ whereas we have made explicit, through code our methodology for creating that data. We have made certain modeling assumptions through out this work, again, these have been made explicit and can be seen in the code. These design and modeling choices are part of the scientific process, so long as they are made explicit, the analysis has merit.*\n\nHope you found this useful and interesting, follow to be notified with my latest posts!\nI have also written this in [blog form on medium](https://medium.com/@pdquant/stocks-significance-testing-p-hacking-how-volatile-is-volatile-1a0da3064b8a) for those who prefer it.\n\nFollow [twitter.com/pdquant](http://www.twitter.com/pdquant) for more!\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

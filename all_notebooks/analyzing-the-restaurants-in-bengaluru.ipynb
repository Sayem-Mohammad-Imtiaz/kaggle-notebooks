From United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all type of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks,Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is best place for foodies. The number of restaurant are increasing day by day. Currently which stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opened every day. However it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. This Zomato data aims at analysing demography of the location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bengaluru on the basis of food.\n\nPlease read full info about the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Dictionary:**\n\n* **url** - contains the url of the restaurant in the zomato website\n* **address** - contains the address of the restaurant in Bengaluru\n* **name** - contains the name of the restaurant\n* **online_order** - whether online ordering is available in the restaurant or not\n* **book_table** - table book option available or not\n* **rate** - contains the overall rating of the restaurant out of 5\n* **votes** - contains total number of rating for the restaurant as of the above mentioned date\n* **phone** - contains the phone number of the restaurant\n* **location** - contains the neighborhood in which the restaurant is located\n* **rest_type** - restaurant type\n* **dish_liked** - dishes people liked in the restaurant\n* **cuisines** - food styles, separated by comma\n* **approx_cost(for two people)** - contains the approximate cost for meal for two people\n* **reviews_list** - list of tuples containing reviews for the restaurant, each tuple consists of two values, rating and review by the customer\n* **menu_item** - contains list of menus available in the restaurant\n* **listed_in(type)** - type of meal\n* **listed_in(city)** - contains the neighborhood in which the restaurant is listed"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> **Note:** Q refers to Questions and I refers to Insights in the markdowns below"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/zomato.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get an idea about the data\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check the shape of the dataset\ndata.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for null values in the dataset\npd.DataFrame({'Column':[i.upper() for i in data.columns],\n                      'Count':data.isnull().sum().values,\n                      'Percentage':((data.isnull().sum().values/len(data))*100).round(2)\n                     })","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have more than 50% null values in the Dish_Liked column.

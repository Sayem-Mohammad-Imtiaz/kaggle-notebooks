(Interval and Ratio levels of measurement are sometimes called Continuous or Scale).\n\nIn descending order of precision, the four different levels of measurement are:\n\n**Nominal**: Latin for name only (Republican, Democrat, Green, Libertarian)  \n**Ordinal**: Think ordered levels or ranks (small–8oz, medium–12oz, large–32oz)  \n**Interval**:Equal intervals among levels (1 dollar to 2 dollars is the same interval as 88 dollars to 89 dollars)  \n**Ratio**:Let the “o” in ratio remind you of a zero in the scale (Day 0, day 1, day 2, day 3, …)  \n \n\nThe first level of measurement is nominal level of measurement.  In this level of measurement, the numbers in the variable are used only to classify the data.  In this level of measurement, words, letters, and alpha-numeric symbols can be used. \n\nThe second level of measurement is the ordinal level of measurement.  This level of measurement depicts some ordered relationship among the variable’s observations. The ordinal level of measurement indicates an ordering of the measurements.\n\nThe third level of measurement is the interval level of measurement.  The interval level of measurement not only classifies and orders the measurements, but it also specifies that the distances between each interval on the scale are equivalent along the scale from low interval to high interval. \n\nThe fourth level of measurement is the ratio level of measurement.  In this level of measurement, the observations, in addition to having equal intervals, can have a value of zero as well.  The zero in the scale makes this type of measurement unlike the other types of measurement, although the properties are similar to that of the interval level of measurement.  In the ratio level of measurement, the divisions between the points on the scale have an equivalent distance between them.\n"},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"_uuid":"6739e483250cd32a22d138075ab4fa22d40bc1fd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Central Tendency"},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"hidden":true,"_uuid":"bc8338529215f4b6b7529fc0434e837ef834f6ba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Mean, Median, Mode"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-02-20T11:22:03.317368Z","start_time":"2019-02-20T11:22:03.209297Z"},"hidden":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b5d5ee68a8021de3c281810594633311611da03c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"age = np.array([1,2,3,5,6,7,7,10,12,13])\n\n# Mean\nmean_age = np.mean(age)\nprint(mean_age)\n\n# Median\nmedian_age = np.median(age)\nprint(median_age)\n\n# Mode\nmode_age = stats.mode(age)\nprint(mode_age)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true,"_uuid":"24a671ac15d59f55eece9ed790a4d71edeb813bf"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dispersion"},{"metadata":{"hidden":true,"_uuid":"62dba2ef00a5bd3edaf5ce776a0fe048f336e244"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In statistics, dispersion (also called variability, scatter, or spread) is the extent to which a distribution is stretched or squeezed.

Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.\n\nThe normal distribution is useful because of the central limit theorem. In its most general form, under some conditions (which include finite variance), it states that averages of samples of observations of random variables independently drawn from independent distributions converge in distribution to the normal, that is, they become normally distributed when the number of observations is sufficiently large. Physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes (such as measurement errors) often have distributions that are nearly normal. Moreover, many results and methods (such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting) can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.\n\nThe normal distribution is sometimes informally called the bell curve. However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions).\n\n$f(x|\\mu,\\sigma^{2}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^{2}}}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu^{2})}{2\\sigma^{2}}}$"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-02-20T11:22:24.40658Z","start_time":"2019-02-20T11:22:23.910249Z"},"hidden":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"53bb00fa3d506d67fd098319d8091b7643c9f5e1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# parameters of normal distribution\nmu, sigma = 110, 20  # mean and standard deviation\ns = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, size=100000)\nprint(\"mean: \", np.mean(s))\nprint(\"standart deviation: \", np.std(s))\n\n# visualize with histogram\nplt.figure(figsize = (10,7))\nplt.hist(s, 100, normed=False)\nplt.ylabel(\"frequency\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52c055889312951be50959c253b5463fea9cebd9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusions\n\nLet me know about your thoughts on my kernel :).

The basic difference between these two is that LDA uses information of classes to find new features in order to maximize its separability while PCA uses the variance of each feature to do the same. In this context, *LDA can be consider a supervised algorithm* and *PCA an unsupervised algorithm.*\n\nThe idea behind PCA is simply to find a low-dimension set of axes that summarize data. Many of these features will measure related properties and so will be redundant. Therefore, we should remove these redundancy and describe each dataset with less properties.

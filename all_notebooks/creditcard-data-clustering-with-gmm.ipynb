They are great approximations for general probability distributions but also because they remain somewhat interpretable even when the dataset gets very complex. Mixture Models do not require to know about data and the subpopulation to which it belongs but learn about the same later on by finding the distribution(s) for its each feature.\n\nIn our dataset we have 17 features, _viz_ , \n - **CUSTID** : Identification of Credit Card holder (Categorical)\n - **BALANCE** : Balance amount left in their account to make purchases\n - **BALANCEFREQUENCY** : How frequently the Balance is updated, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently updated, 0 = not frequently updated)\n - **PURCHASES** : Amount of purchases made from account\n - **ONEOFFPURCHASES** : Maximum purchase amount done in one-go\n - **INSTALLMENTSPURCHASES** : Amount of purchase done in installment\n - **CASHADVANCE** : Cash in advance given by the user\n - **PURCHASESFREQUENCY** : How frequently the Purchases are being made, score between 0 and 1 (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)\n - **ONEOFFPURCHASESFREQUENCY** : How frequently Purchases are happening in one-go (1 = frequently purchased, 0 = not frequently purchased)\n - **PURCHASESINSTALLMENTSFREQUENCY** : How frequently purchases in installments are being done (1 = frequently done, 0 = not frequently done)\n - **CASHADVANCEFREQUENCY** : How frequently the cash in advance being paid\n - **CASHADVANCETRX** : Number of Transactions made with \"Cash in Advanced\"\n - **PURCHASESTRX** : Numbe of purchase transactions made\n - **CREDITLIMIT** : Limit of Credit Card for user\n - **PAYMENTS** : Amount of Payment done by user\n - **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS** : Minimum amount of payments made by user\n - **PRCFULLPAYMENT** : Percent of full payment paid by user\n - **TENURE** : Tenure of credit card service for user\n\nLeaving the first feature each may have its own Gaussian distribution that can easily depict the customer behaviour.

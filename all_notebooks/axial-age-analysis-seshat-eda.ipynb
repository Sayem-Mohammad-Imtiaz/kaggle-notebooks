It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically liminal period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.\n\n<h2 style = \"font-family: garamond; font-size: 40px; font-style: normal; letter-spcaing: 3px; background-color:Gray; color : #fed049; border-radius: 5px 5px; text-align:center; font-weight: bold\" >About the Organisation</h2> \n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank is an international scientific research project of the nonprofit Evolution Institute. Founded in 2011, the Seshat: Global History Databank gathers data into a single, large database that can be used to test scientific hypotheses.\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank is an umbrella organization for numerous research projects that examine different facets or themes of human life. Each project is headed by various members of the Seshat Team along with a group of consultants and contributing experts. Support for our research comes from a variety of private donors, academic, and governmental funding sources.\n\n\nThe Seshat: Global History Databank claims to be a scientific approach to historical research and its large dataset, though compiled with the intention of being theory-neutral, is frequently of interest to researchers of cliodynamics. The main goal of cliodynamics researchers is to use the scientific method to produce the data necessary to empirically test competing theories.\n\n<h2 style = \"font-family: garamond; font-size: 40px; font-style: normal; letter-spcaing: 3px; background-color:Gray; color : #fed049; border-radius: 5px 5px; text-align:center; font-weight: bold\" >About the Dataset and the Project</h2> \n\nThe  vast  amount  of  knowledge  about  past  human  societies  has  not  been  systematically  organized  and,  therefore,  remains  inaccessible  for empirically   testing   theories   about   cultural   evolution   and   historical  dynamics.  For  example,  what  evolutionary  mechanisms  were  involved  in  the  transition  from  the small-scale,  uncentralized societies, in which humans lived 10,000 years ago, to the large-scalesocieties  with  an  extensive  division  of  labor,  great  differentials  in  wealth  and  power,  and elaborate  governance  structures  of  today? Why do modern states sometimes fail to meet the basic needs of their populations?  Why  do  economies  decline,  or  fail  to  grow?  In  this  article, we describe  the  structure  and  uses  of a  massive  databank of historical and archaeological information, Seshat: The Global History Databank. The data that we are currently entering in Seshat will allow us  and  others  to  test  theories  explaining  how  modern  societies  evolved from ancestral ones, and why modern societies vary so much in their capacity to satisfy their membersâ€™ basic human needs. \n\nThere are 15 variables, let's understand them.\n\n* Date.From :- This refers to the Year from which the data about the particular region is taken into account. Negative dates refer to the BCE.\n\n* NGA :- NGA stands for \"Natural Geographic Area\".

Conclusion</h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.** Moralistic Punishment was the least in Kansai and Middle Yellow River Valley and highest in the Gailee region across the Axial Age.\n\n**2.** Promotion of proscality was important to people regardless of the NGA or the timeperiod.\n\n**3.** We can see that the social norms of equality between elites and commoners and rulers and commoners are literally same in Cambodian Basin region,. This can be interpreted as the social norm grew in existence in these time periods due to a variety of factors not known.\n\n**4.** In the Upper Egypt region, commoners were treated equally with the elites for a prolonged period of time while the notion of treating rulers and commoners equally came around in the late 1000 CE.\n\n**5.** The number of NGAs with increasing morals and laws were increasing till 1800s but a slight decline from there.\n\n**6.** Formal_regal_code goes is highly corelated with Moralizing_norms, general applicability of law and moralizing norms as we can see from their correlations.\n\n**7.** Moralistic Punishment is correlated with Omniscient and Supernatural beings and we can probably assume this way that the belief of gods in people impacted the moralistic punishments.\n\n**8.** Equating elites with commoners has a high correlation with equating rulers with commoners as we already saw the similar trends in various graphs.\n\n**9.** In the places where people believed that their rulers are supreme, we can see that the equality of elites and commoners and equality of rulers and commoners is nearly equal to 0.\n\n**10.** There has been a constant increase in the sociopolitical norms in every NGA with time. More following of norms and this might have happened with awareness, as people became more aware with time, the norms spread.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" <p style = \"font-size:30px; color: lightcoral\"><strong> Thanks for following up the notebook this far.

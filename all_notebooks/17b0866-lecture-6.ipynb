Therefore, most infected people recover within 10 days, but many do not recover and the symptoms are prolonged.\nLooking at the number of infected people, the peak of the first wave was on 31st March, and the number of infected people decreased from there, but then the second wave came and peaked on May 31st.\nIn major cities in Philippines, lockdown started on the night of March 14, and residents were not allowed to go out except for shopping for food and daily necessities. Since the peak of the first wave was March 31, it seems that the people infected just before the lockdown had reached the peak after the 2-week incubation period. In May, it became possible to take out at restaurants and regulations were relaxed. Outgoing movement restrictions were relaxed on May 16th, which may have affected the peak of May 31st.\nLockdown is still ongoing in the Philippines.\n\nreferences\nhttp://www.manila-shimbun.com/","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

At this point you know how to get embeddings for each word in the documents, but you're only using the averaged document vectors with these models. Using the word vectors themselves might result in even better performing models. To do this you'll want to use a recurrent neural network (RNN for short). We won't cover RNNs in this course, but look them up if you want to learn about state-of-the-art NLP models."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"---\n**[Natural Language Processing Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/natural-language-processing)**\n\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?

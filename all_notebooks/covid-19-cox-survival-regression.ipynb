This is not to be confused with the recovery of a patient. It rather means how many days a patient survived while being observed. Survival in this case means not death and not recovery. Consequently, if the patient is not deceased or has he not recovered, the patient is censored, meaning we do not know the outcome yet.\n\nAt this point I would like to state that we are working within a \"competing risks\" setting.

In Cox Regression particularly, the hazard of a subject is described by the following function\n\n$\\underbrace{h(t | x)}_{\\text{hazard}} = \\overbrace{b_0(t)}^{\\text{baseline hazard}} \\underbrace{\\exp \\overbrace{\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i (x_i - \\overline{x_i})\\right)}^{\\text{log-partial hazard}}}_ {\\text{partial hazard}}$\n\nwhere $b_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard and which is scaled up or down based on some regressors X\n\nIn this exercise I am using the hazard concept as the conditional probability of experiencing an event (death or recovery) given the patient's survival until a specific day. The features I am using for predicting the hazard are the age decade of the patient and the gender.\n\nBut since we are operating in a competing risks setting, we will have to fit 2 different models. The first one outputs the baseline hazard for the death event, while the second one will output the baseline hazard of the recovery event. An important distinction that we need to make is that we censor competing events at the time of the occurence. Let's say for example that we are modeling the event of death. A patient who recovered 14 days after he was diagnosed, will be censored at 14 days of survival (the \"survived\" column in the dataset will have the value 14). The opposite will happen for a patient who died, when we will be modeling the event of recovery.\nThis approach is the \"cause specific\" hazard approach, in contrast with \"subdistribution\" hazard approach, where in the latter, subjects that experience a competing risk remain in the risk set.

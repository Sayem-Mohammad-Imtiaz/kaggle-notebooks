We can recognize one red dot (an earthquake greater than M7) around 20:00 and many small earthquakes were happeding before and after the main earthquake around Alaska Peninsula. According to an article by Weather News, National Tsunami Warning Center annonced the Tsunami Alert in the region, and Japan Meteorological Agency also warned some sea-level fluctuation in Japan. The tsunami brought by this earthquake was estimated 1 meter on the coast of Alaska. However, according to US News, *there was no major damage from the quake or tsunami*. From the anaylsis and these news, I found that some severe earthquakes are happening in rural areas, and they are not broadcasted because they do not bring huge damage to our lives and properties.

Data for Analysis\nThis is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, and Rajiv Ramnath. “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.”, 2019.\n\nMoosavi, Sobhan, Mohammad Hossein Samavatian, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Radu Teodorescu, and Rajiv Ramnath. \"Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights.\" In proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, ACM, 2019.\n\n**Author**\nRonghui Zhou, zhou.uf@gmail.com https://github.com/RonghuiZhou\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import the data from CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/us-accidents/US_Accidents_June20.csv')\nprint(\"Shape of input DataFrame is - \",df.shape,\"\\n\")\nprint(\"List of Columns in the dataset are:\\n\",df.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

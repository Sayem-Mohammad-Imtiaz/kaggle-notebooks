Version 1 was based on an analysis of batsmen, but only of batsmen.  This may have allowed inaccuracies to creep in.  Examples:\n* Batsmen Agarwal and Bairstow are the first wicket partnership, and are 1 and 2 in the batting order, respectively.  Agarwal is caught out, but Agarwal and Bairstow crossed, meaning that the 3rd batsmen in the batting order, de Villiers, enters the game at the non-striker's end.  On the next delivery, Bairstow is dismissed LBW, and is replaced by the 4th batsman, Finch.  Version 1 would have indicated Finch at position 3, then de Villiers at position 4 as Finch would have batted before de Villiers.\n    \n* In the event that a batsman ever entered the game as the non-striker but never batted, they would have been left out of the analysis, as they would not have been registered in the batsman column of the DataFrame"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"deliveries = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020/IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Re-sort data (original data set was off-set, such that initial row is ball 5 of over 6 from the first match)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"deliveries = deliveries.sort_values(by=[\"id\", \"inning\", \"over\", \"ball\"]).reset_index()\ndeliveries = deliveries.drop(columns = [\"index\"])\ndeliveries","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Establish list to fill future data frame.

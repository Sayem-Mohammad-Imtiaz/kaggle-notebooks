Most tokens only attend “locally” to each other meaning that each token attends to its 12w previous tokens and 12w succeding tokens with w being the window length as defined in config.attention_window. Note that config.attention_window can be of type list to define a different w for each layer. A selecetd few tokens attend “globally” to all other tokens, as it is conventionally done for all tokens in e.g. BertSelfAttention.\n> \n> Note that “locally” and “globally” attending tokens are projected by different query, key and value matrices. Also note that every “locally” attending token not only attends to tokens within its window w, but also to all “globally” attending tokens so that global attention is symmetric.\n> \n> The user can define which tokens attend “locally” and which tokens attend “globally” by setting the tensor global_attention_mask at run-time appropriately. Longformer employs the following logic for global_attention_mask: 0 - the token attends “locally”, 1 - token attends “globally”. For more information please also refer to forward() method.\n> \n> Using Longformer self attention, the memory and time complexity of the query-key matmul operation, which usually represents the memory and time bottleneck, can be reduced from O(ns×ns) to O(ns×w), with ns being the sequence length and w being the average window size. It is assumed that the number of “globally” attending tokens is insignificant as compared to the number of “locally” attending tokens.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## One Question you might face?\n\n### What are sequence and pooled outputs?\n\nAnswer is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/86510)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summing the results from last 4 layers of Model\n## to get word embedding","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For quick execution I have created emeddings just for first 5 articles\n\nTo get embeddings replace first line of below cell\n\n> all_content=list(news['Content'][:])","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"all_content=list(news['Content'][:5])\n#doing only for first 5 contents\n# because doing for complete takes 2 hours on CPU\n\ndef sentence_bert():\n    list_of_emb=[]\n    for i in range(len(all_content)):\n        SAMPLE_TEXT = all_content[i]  # long input document\n        input_ids = torch.tensor(tokenizer.encode(SAMPLE_TEXT)).unsqueeze(0)  # batch of size 1\n\n        # Attention mask values -- 0: no attention, 1: local attention, 2: global attention\n        attention_mask = torch.ones(input_ids.shape, dtype=torch.long, device=input_ids.device) # initialize to local attention\n        attention_mask[:, [0,-1]] = 2  # Set global attention based on the task.

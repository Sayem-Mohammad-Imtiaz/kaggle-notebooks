If the test result is positive, the health worker will trace the patient's recent activity and track the contact. Once a new case is found, the Korean’s mobile phone will vibrate and an emergency alert will be issued. By early detection and treatment of infections, and isolation of mild patients to special centers, South Korea managed to leave all hospitals to critical patients. The country’s case fatality rate is just over 1%, one of the lowest in the world.\n\nAnd also, TV broadcasts, subway station announcements, and smartphone reminders will constantly prompt people to wear masks, instruct people how to stay away from others, and report infection data for the day to get people's daily participation.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"reference：\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_Korea\n\nhttps://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/05/08/asia-pacific/science-health-asia-pacific/south-korea-coronavirus-seoul-nightclubs/#.XuWMHC-tY6U\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

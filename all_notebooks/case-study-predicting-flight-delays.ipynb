Given the large dataset, let's just work with the flights from January 2015th.\n2. Transform **YEAR, MONTH, DAY, DAY_OF_WEEK ** to datetime\n3. In the **SCHEDULED_DEPARTURE** variable, the hour of the take-off is coded as a float where the two first digits indicate the hour and the two last, the minutes. This format is not convenient and you should thus convert it. Finally, merge the take-off hour with the flight date.\n\n### Exploration\n\n1. Visualize and compare flight count per airline\n2. Visualize the average delay(take-off or landing) per airline\n3. Find out if there is a relation between airport and delays\n4. Temporal variability of delays\n\n### Modelling\t\n\n1. Predicting flight delays - per airline and all airports \n2. Predicting flight delays - all airline and all airports\n3. Is there a risk of overfitting, how to handle it?\n4. Model accuracy calculation\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"version":"3.6.1","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"},"file_extension":".py","nbconvert_exporter":"python","name":"python"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

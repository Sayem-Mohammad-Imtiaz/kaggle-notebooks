For our project, we decided to investigate the application of Recurrent Nueral Networks to the task of building a Subreddit recommender system for Reddit users. In this post, I outline some of the implementation details of the final system. A minimal webapp for the final model can be interacted with [here,](http://ponderinghydrogen.pythonanywhere.com/) The final research paper for the project can be found [here](http://cole-maclean.github.io/blog/files/subreddit-recommender.pdf) and my collaboraters on the project are Barbara Garza and Suren Oganesian. The github repo for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/cole-maclean/MAI-CI) with this jupyter notebook being [here.](https://github.com/cole-maclean/MAI-CI/blob/master/notebooks/blog%20post.ipynb)\n\n![spez](http://cole-maclean.github.io/img/spez.PNG)\n\n<h3>Model Hypothesis</h3>\n\nThe goal of the project is to utilize the sequence prediction power of RNN's to predict possibly interesting subreddits to a user based on their comment history. The hypothesis of the recommender model is, given an ordered sequence of user subreddit interactions, patterns will emerge that favour the discovery of paticular new subreddits given that historical user interaction sequence. Intuitively speaking, as users interact with the Reddit ecosystem, they discover new subreddits of interest, but these new discoveries are influenced by the communities they have previously been interacting with. We can then train a model to recognize these emergent subreddit discoveries based on users historical subreddit discovery patterns. When the model is presented with a new sequence of user interaction, it \"remembers\" other users that historically had similiar interaction habits and recommends their subreddits that the current user has yet to discover.  \n \nThis sequential view of user interaction/subreddit discovery is similiar in structure to other problems being solved with the use of Recurrent Neural Networks, such as [Character Level Language Modelling](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) and [Automatic Authorship Detection](http://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-iii-variable-length-sequences.html). Due to the successes of these similiarly structured problems, we have decided to explore RNN models for the subbreddit Recommendator System.\n\n<h3>The Data</h3>\nThe secret sauce in any machine learning system, we need data. Reddit provides a convenient API for scrapping its public facing data, and the python package [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a popular and well documented wrapper that we used in this project. With the aim of developing sequences of user subreddit interactions, all we need for our raw data is a list of 3-tuples in the form [username,subreddit,utc timestamp].\n\n<h2>Data Munging</h2>\nWe need to parse the raw data into a structure consumpable by a supervised learning algorithm like RNN's. First we build a model vocabulary and ditribution of subreddit popularity from the collect raw data. We use this to build the training dataset, the subreddit interaction sequence for each user, ordered and then split into chunks representing different periods of Reddit interaction and discovery. From each chunk, we can randomly remove a single subreddit from the interaction as the \"discovered\" subreddit and use it as our training label for the interaction sequences. This formulation brings with it a hyperparameter that will require tuning, namely the sequence size of each chunk of user interaction periods. The proposed model utilizes the distribution of subreddits existing in the dataset to weight the random selection of a subreddit as the sequence label, which gives a higher probability of selection to rarer subreddits. This will smoothen the distribution of training labels across the models vocabulary of subreddits in the dataset. Also, each users interaction sequence has been compressed to only represent the sequence of non-repeating subreddits, to eliminate the repeatative structure of users constantly commenting in a single subreddit, while providing information of the users habits in the reddit ecosystem more generally, allowing the model to distinguish broader patterns from the compressed sequences."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"48170620-43b8-938d-7b71-761c0f3673b2"},"outputs":[],"source":"import random\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef chunks(l, n):\n    n = max(1, n)\n    return (l[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(l), n))\n\ndef normalize(lst):\n    s = sum(lst)\n    normed = [itm/s for itm in lst]\n    normed[-1] = (normed[-1] + (1-sum(normed)))#pad last value with what ever difference neeeded to make sum to exactly 1\n    return normed\n\n\"\"\"This routine develops the models vocabulary and vocab_probs is also built, representing the inverse probability \nof encounting a paticular subreddit in the given dataset, which is then used to bias the selection of rarer\nsubreddits as labels to \nsmooth the distribution of training labels across all subreddits in the vocabulary\"\"\"\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/reddit_data.csv\").head(100000) #reduce dataset size to first 100,000 comments\nvocab_counts = df[\"subreddit\"].value_counts()\ntmp_vocab = list(vocab_counts.keys())\ntotal_counts = sum(vocab_counts.values)\ninv_prob = [total_counts/vocab_counts[sub] for sub in tmp_vocab]\nvocab = [\"Unseen-Sub\"] + tmp_vocab #build place holder, Unseen-Sub, for all subs not in vocab\ntmp_vocab_probs = normalize(inv_prob)\n#force probs sum to 1 by adding differenc to \"Unseen-sub\" probability\nvocab_probs = [1-sum(tmp_vocab_probs)] + tmp_vocab_probs\nprint(\"Vocab size = \" + str(len(vocab)))\n\n#Subredit Sequencing\nsequence_chunk_size = 15\ndef remove_repeating_subs(df):\n    cache_data = {}\n    prev_usr = None\n    past_sub = None\n    for comment_data in df.itertuples():\n        current_usr = comment_data[1]\n        if current_usr != prev_usr:#New user found in sorted comment data, begin sequence extraction for new user\n            if prev_usr != None and prev_usr not in cache_data.keys():#dump sequences to cache for previous user if not in cache\n                cache_data[prev_usr] = usr_sub_seq\n            usr_sub_seq = [comment_data[2]] #initialize user sub sequence list with first sub for current user\n            past_sub = comment_data[2]\n        else:#if still iterating through the same user, add new sub to sequence if not a repeat\n            if comment_data[2] != past_sub:#Check that next sub comment is not a repeat of the last interacted with sub,\n                                            #filtering out repeated interactions\n                usr_sub_seq.append(comment_data[2])\n                past_sub = comment_data[2]\n        prev_usr = current_usr #update previous user to being the current one before looping to next comment\n    return cache_data\n\ndef build_training_sequences(usr_data):\n    train_seqs = []\n    #split user sub sequences into provided chunks of size sequence_chunk_size\n    for usr,usr_sub_seq in usr_data.items():\n        comment_chunks = chunks(usr_sub_seq,sequence_chunk_size)\n        for chnk in comment_chunks:\n            #for each chunk, filter out potential labels to select as training label, filter by the top subs filter list\n            filtered_subs = [vocab.index(sub) for sub in chnk]\n            if filtered_subs:\n                #randomly select the label from filtered subs, using the vocab probability distribution to smooth out\n                #representation of subreddit labels\n                filter_probs = normalize([vocab_probs[sub_indx] for sub_indx in filtered_subs])\n                label = np.random.choice(filtered_subs,1,p=filter_probs)[0]\n                #build sequence by ensuring users sub exists in models vocabulary and filtering out the selected\n                #label for this subreddit sequence\n                chnk_seq = [vocab.index(sub) for sub in chnk if sub in vocab and vocab.index(sub) != label] \n                train_seqs.append([chnk_seq,label,len(chnk_seq)]) \n    return train_seqs"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5447ca1b-5844-7417-d01b-a2cbba0e31b2"},"source":"We transform the munged-data into a pandas dataframe for easier manipulation.

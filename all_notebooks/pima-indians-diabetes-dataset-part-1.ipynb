I used the [blog post of Ritchie Ng](http://www.ritchieng.com/machine-learning-evaluate-classification-model/) as a backbone and complemented it with other stuff I found useful. \n\nThe goal is to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians within five years using machine learning. A model that could do this very well, could help focusing prevention measures to the affected.\n\nThe Dataset is available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/pima+indians+diabetes). The original paper using this dataset can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2245318/). This paper from 1984 created a model with a sensitivity and specificity of 76%. We have 2017 now, let's try to beat this!\n\nLearn more about the Pima Indians in the video below.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{},"source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo(\"pN4HqWRybwk\")","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"source":"## Loading Libraries","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"# show plots inside the notebook  \n%matplotlib inline \n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"source":"## Data Loading","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"diabetes_dataset = pd.read_csv(\"../input/diabetes.csv\")","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"source":"Data Set Information:\n\nSeveral constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.

Only 26 states with peak dates that have not yet passed (as of April 15th) are examined in this analysis.\n\n\n\n*Sources of data include NPR for peak dates, World Population Review for median age and population data, and the Kaiser Family Foundation for median annual household income data.

Metrics (by county) used include median annual household income, median age, percent poverty, total COVID-19 cases per capita, and total COVID-19 deaths per capita.\n\n**Reason Why MA was Selected:**\nMassachusetts' status as a coronavirus hotspot is confirmed by the climbing death rate. It is currently ranked [3rd in the number of COVID-19 cases](https://www.foxnews.com/health/massachusetts-new-coronavirus-hot-spot) in the US, and these numbers are continuing to rise. Furthermore, due to the high prevalence of crowded housing in minority communities, the risk of COVID-19 spreading Massachusetts only increases.\n\n**Reason Why GA was Selected:** \nWith Georgia [re-opening businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/24/opinion/coronavirus-covid-19-georgia-reopen.html), it is even more imperative that more test centers are established in Georgia. Georgia has extremely low testing rates, with only 1% of its citizens having been tested. Its testing rate continues to fall behind that of other states while the incidence of COVID-19 cases in Georgia continue to rise. With these increased number of cases and a high population of at-risk individuals, more testing will help to identify asymptomatic carriers in Georgia.\n\n**Reason Why MN was Selected:** \nMinnesota now records over [1 coronavirus-related death every hour](https://www.startribune.com/this-won-t-be-the-last-hard-day-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-says-as-daily-covid-deaths-hit-28/569963432/). With Minnesota's reopening of some workplaces, concerns of COVID-19 spreading are growing. Group-living housing, such as assisted-living facilities, are becoming hot spots for corona virus due to Minnesota's large elderly population. It is essential that there are more testing centers in Minnesota to get a better estimate of the true number of COVID-19 cases and to protect its population.\n\n*All population, median income, and percent of population in poverty data was sourced from IndexMundi/US Census Bureau.

This allows words to be processed, but it creates the issue that the values lose their meaning. In image data, the magnitude of a datapoint corresponds the the brightness of a pixel, so a larger value will correspond to a brighter pixel. However, the magnitude of datapoints in a vectorized dataset don't have that meaning -- a point with value 5000 doesn't necessarily have more meaning than a point with the value 0. If we represent the text as categorical data with one-hot arrays, we get the issue of sparcity: with a vocabulary of 50000 words, where only 400 words are used per document, this method would be extremely inefficient.\n\nThis is why we use an embedding layer. An embedding layer is simply a matrix where each row corresponds to a representation of a word in the vocabulary. Each representation is a 1D vector of real numbers that is learned when training. Now, we can process words with vectors of managable, fixed sizes and, because these representations are learned, they often are semantically reasonable as well."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Embedding Layer](https://miro.medium.com/max/1596/1*1hPDk0gPyIBg0D5SzY5t7Q.png)\n\nSource: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-the-heck-is-word-embedding-b30f67f01c81"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Embedding layers aren't limited to word representations either, they can be useful in many types of data, especially when it is sparse."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We create an embedding layer by specifying the input size of the mapping (number of words in vocabulary + 1), output size (length of vector representation), and input length (amount of words per sequence).\n\nWe add 1 to the vocab size because 0 is a reserved value that we use for padding."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"EMBEDDING_DIM = 100\nmodel.add(Embedding(MAX_NB_WORDS+1, EMBEDDING_DIM, input_length=MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**LSTM Layer**\n\nInitially, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allowed for neural networks to effectively process time series data by taking in past outputs as input:\n\n![rnn](http://www.easy-tensorflow.com/images/NN/01.png)\n\nSource: http://www.easy-tensorflow.com/tf-tutorials/recurrent-neural-networks/vanilla-rnn-for-classification\n\nHowever, this type of network had a very short memory.

Another gate also decides what information to output.\n\nThis is an extreme oversimplification and I would recommend anyone interested to check out this [great article](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Adding the LSTM layer to the model, we need to set the number of units.

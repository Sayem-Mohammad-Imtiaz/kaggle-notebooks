Thank you for taking the time to peruse my Kaggle notebook. This notebook serves a dual purpose - it is both an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and an **introductory tutorial to Pandas**. Thus, there will be significant explanation interwoven into our analysis of this data, which was originally posted on Kaggle by the Wall Street Journal. This tutorial is best for those who are beginners and are just learning the Pandas tool. The dataset concerns the salaries college graduates receive throughout their careers, and presents this data in terms of college type, major, or region.\n\nI was inspired to base my tutorial and analysis on this dataset because high school seniors as well as transfer students have recently received their admissions letters (congratulations!), and they may be making the difficult, yet exhilirating, decision of choosing where to attend college and what major to pursue in their time there. Although how lucrative a major or a college is should not be the biggest driver in your decision-making process, it is definitely something to consider. I hope you find this analysis and tutorial useful, whether it be in learning about Pandas or in choosing we're you're headed next."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction: Preparing the Dataset for Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To begin, let's run the cell below in order to import our needed classes as well as input files:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will create ***three*** different DataFrames utilizing the provided csv files:\n    1. **sbm**, which will represent salaries in relation to major (sbm serves as shorthand for salaries by major)\n    2. **sbc**, which will represent salaries in relation to college type (sbc serves as shorthand for salaries by college type)\n    3. **sbr**, which will represent salaries in relation to region (sbr serves as shorthand for salaries by region)\nRun the next code cell to store the DataFrames in their respective variables:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The index for salaries based on major is set to the 'Undergraduate Major'\nsbm = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/college-salaries/degrees-that-pay-back.csv').set_index('Undergraduate Major')\n# The index for salaries based on college type and region is set to the 'School Name'\nsbc = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/college-salaries/salaries-by-college-type.csv').set_index('School Name')\nsbr = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/college-salaries/salaries-by-region.csv').set_index('School Name')\n\n#set_index() uses an existing column in the DataFrame and sets it as the DataFrame index","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code in its original form stores the salaries as strings in the format \"$XX,XXX.XX\".

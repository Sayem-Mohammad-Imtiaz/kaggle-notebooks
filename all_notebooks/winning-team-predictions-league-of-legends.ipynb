Introduction\n\nLeague of Legends is one of the most popular games ever existed, and has one of the most important competitive games. In this game 2 teams (blue and red) fight to take out the enemy's nexus to win the game. Each team has 5 players that control 5 champions. There are 3 lanes, a jungle, and 5 roles. \n\nLike all MOBA games, we have different objectives in the game which give a certain advantage in the game. This information about these objectives is what will help us make our winning prediction model. To increase our chances to win a game, there are lots of different objectives and events to do, fights to win to increase the power of your champion, as well as winning map terrain by taking down turrets and putting vision on the map.\n\nThe information needed to create our model will be obtained in the following League of Legends Ranked Games dataset from Kaggle:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-soloq-ranked-games\n\n"},{"metadata":{"cell_id":"00002-a298fd8d-f401-47f1-97a3-05710969a390","output_cleared":false,"tags":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Game events and objectives\nIn order to understand all the attributes in our dataset its important to know about the following **most important events or objectives** in the game:\n* **Gold and experience**: To make your champion stronger, you need to buy objects and obtain experience to level up. To do so, you have to kill minions, destroy towers, kill enemies...\n* **Nexus**: This structure is the most important one of the game, as destroying this structure means winning the game.\n* **Inhibitors**: This is one of the most important structure in the game. Destroying it makes the minions a lot stronger, that means that if nobody stops them, they will keep pushing lanes winning, winning map presence. Inhibitors will regenerate themselves in 5 minutes.\n* **Towers**: Towers are the ones that defend our part of the map, by taking them down we gain enemy territory. There are 4 types of towers: outer towers, inner towers, base towers (defending inhibitors), nexus towers (defending nexus). Taking down the first turret gives us extra gold.\n* **Wards**: To increase the chances to win its also very important to place Wards on the map. This Wards will help us obtain map vision, gaining information about who is there and what happens there, so we take the right decisions such as not getting caught by the enemy team.\n* **KDA**: KDA (Kills, deaths, assist) is one of the most things about your game. Having a good KDA ratio means you have obtained a lot of gold, and taken a lot of time from the enemy, as killing them means they have to wait certain seconds out of the map before reviving again.\n* **Drakes, Herald and Baron**: This 3 monsters have a very strong impact in the game. If you kill them, you obtain certain bonus that will help you take the advantage in the game. \nBy killing Herald you can invocate him, and will help you to destroy the enemy towers. \nKilling drakes will give you certain bonuses depending on the drake, such as more damage, health regeneration...\nKilling Baron will give you a 4 minute boost that makes near ally minion a lot stronger.\n\n\n","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"cell_id":"00003-01832ab1-41b3-4ef4-816d-bbb21b12fbbb","output_cleared":false,"tags":[],"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.

Gold is the most important feature to make the prediction. We can see this on the high correlation that goldDiff has with hasWon, and also in some of the graphics that calculate the probability of winning given a certain feature like FirstTower (which give a lot of gold).\n\n2. The amount of data in this dataset was so big that trying a lot of models and doing hyperparameter search with GridSearchCV was not possible. In general the computational time to execute the creation of models or trying a lot of parameterers was so high, executing during hours to obtain the results.\n\n3. At the end, we obtain an accuracy of 81% optimizing the model with the best hyperparameters and doing cross-validation. I think we can conclude that this accuracy is actually not that bad as it may seem. Winning or not a game of League of Legends doesn't depend only on the data we're given, it depends on more things like map control, team play... Apart from this, we can see that we are not looking at a dataset of proplayers, and in this rank it's more common that game advandadge change at late game and made come backs happen more frequently."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

I try to think about life.\nI don’t listen to what art critics say. I don’t know anybody who needs a critic to find out what art is.\" -Jean Michel Basquiat\n\n* Art is often considered the process or product of deliberately arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions. It encompasses a diverse range of human activities, creations and ways of expression, including music, literature, film, sculpture and paintings. The meaning of art is explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics\n* The visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, photography, video, filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture. Many artistic disciplines such as performing arts, conceptual art, textile arts also involve aspects of visual arts as well as arts of other types"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem Statement\n\n* With a collection of artworks of 50 of the most influential artists of all time, the aim is to create a **convolutional neural network** to recognise the artists looking at the colors used and the geometric patterns inside the pictures.\n* This could help detect forgeries in the art world with by being more accurate than even trained art critics at detecting the forgeries"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Metric of Success \n* Accuracy Score"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Understanding the Context\n\nThis dataset contains three files:\n\n* artists.csv: dataset of information for each artist\n* images.zip: collection of images (full size), divided in folders and sequentially numbered\n* resized.zip: same collection but images have been resized and extracted from folder structure\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Experimental Design\n\nCRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts.

cleaning the data and performing feature engineering\n* Data modelling -identify the modelling technique\n* Evaluation - gauging whether the standard to which the model meets the set business

Time series analysis have become a widely used tool in the field of analytics inorder to understand a variable which depends on time. \n\n## What is time series analysis?\n<img src=\"https://dataanalyticsedge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/time-series-analysis.png\">\nTime series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis.  Time series data means that data is in a series of  particular time periods or intervals.  The data is considered in three types:\n\n* **Time series data:** A set of observations on the values that a variable takes at different times.\n\n* **Cross-sectional** data: Data of one or more variables, collected at the same point in time.\n\n* **Pooled data:** A combination of time series data and cross-sectional data.\n\nSource:[Statistics Solution](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/time-series-analysis/) \n\n## Reliance Industries\n\n<img src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/btmt/images/stories/reliance_industries_logo_660x450_090720075629.jpg\">\n\nReliance Industries Limited (RIL) is an Indian multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Reliance owns businesses across India engaged in energy, petrochemicals, textiles, natural resources, retail, and telecommunications. Reliance is one of the most profitable companies in India, the largest publicly traded company in India by market capitalization, and the largest company in India as measured by revenue after recently surpassing the government-controlled Indian Oil Corporation.[5] On 22 June 2020, Reliance Industries became the first Indian company to exceed US$150 billion in market capitalization after its market capitalization hit ₹11,43,667 crore on the BSE.\n\nThe company is ranked 106th on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations as of 2019. It is ranked 8th among the Top 250 Global Energy Companies by Platts as of 2016. Reliance continues to be India's largest exporter, accounting for 8% of India's total merchandise exports with a value of ₹1,47,755 crore and access to markets in 108 countries. Reliance is responsible for almost 5% of the government of India's total revenues from customs and excise duty. It is also the highest income tax payer in the private sector in India.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Industries)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n1.

It starts with preparing the data for visualizations and goes on with an extensive exploratory data analysis which also includes the impact of Reliance stocks due to COVID-19 and followed by time series model building and using the new tool Prophet for time series forecasting released by Facebook\n\n## Objectives of the project\n1. Data Preparation\n2. Data Visualization\n3. Building a time series model\n\n\n## Dataset\nThe data is the price history and trading volumes of the fifty stocks in the index [NIFTY 50 from NSE](https://www.nseindia.com/) (National Stock Exchange) India. All datasets are at a day-level with pricing and trading values split across .cvs files for each stock along with a metadata file with some macro-information about the stocks itself. The data spans from 1st January, 2000 to 31st July, 2020.\n\n### Import libraries","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pmdarima","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Basic Libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport datetime as dt\nfrom datetime import datetime    \nfrom pandas import Series \nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n#Visualization libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\n%matplotlib inline\nimport altair as alt \nfrom pylab import rcParams\nrcParams['figure.figsize'] = 20, 10\n\n#ignore warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n#Timeseries model libraries\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\nfrom pmdarima import auto_arima\nfrom fbprophet import Prophet\n\n#Performance metric libraries\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error\nfrom fbprophet.diagnostics import cross_validation\nfrom fbprophet.diagnostics import performance_metrics\nfrom fbprophet.plot import plot_cross_validation_metric\n\n\nimport cufflinks\ncufflinks.go_offline()\ncufflinks.set_config_file(world_readable=True, theme='pearl')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import dataset\nFirst let's welcome our dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reliance_raw=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nifty50-stock-market-data/RELIANCE.csv\")\n\n## print shape of dataset with rows and columns and information \nprint (\"The shape of the  data is (row, column):\"+ str(reliance_raw.shape))\nprint (reliance_raw.info())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reliance_raw.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset Details\n\n\nDescription of columns in the file:\n\n* Date - Date of trade\n* symbol - Name of the company (Reliance)\n* Series - We have only one series(EQ): It stands for Equity.

Moving averages are a simple and common type of smoothing used in time series analysis and time series forecasting.Calculating a moving average involves creating a new series where the values are comprised of the average of raw observations in the original time series.A moving average requires that you specify a window size called the window width. This defines the number of raw observations used to calculate the moving average value.The “moving” part in the moving average refers to the fact that the window defined by the window width is slid along the time series to calculate the average values in the new series.\n\nIn our project we consider the moving mean and standard deviation for 3,7 and 30 days.

It uses an autoregressive model and optimizes an information criterion across multiple different lag values.\n\nThe null hypothesis of the test is that the time series can be represented by a unit root, that it is not stationary (has some time-dependent structure).

For this purpose, you fit a model to a training data set, which results in an estimator f^(x) that can make predictions for new samples x.\n\n* **Forecasting** is a sub-discipline of prediction in which we are making predictions about the future, on the basis of time-series data. Thus, the only difference between prediction and forecasting is that we consider the temporal dimension.\n\nFor model building we are considering the Close price feature.

Before implementing ARIMA, you need to make the series stationary, and determine the values of p and q using the plots we discussed above. Auto ARIMA makes this task really simple for us as it eliminates steps like converting stationarity and getting values of p,q from acf anf pacf plots.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">  \nThe following explanation about acf and pacf is for study purposes. It is not used in our models as we are using auto arima where p,q are figured out by the model by selecting the best AIC\n</div>\n<br>\n\n## ACF AND PACF PLOTS\n\n**ACF** is an (complete) auto-correlation function which gives us values of auto-correlation of any series with its lagged values. We plot these values along with the confidence band and tada! We have an ACF plot. In simple terms, it describes how well the present value of the series is related with its past values.\n\n**PACF** is a partial auto-correlation function. Basically instead of finding correlations of present with lags like ACF, it finds correlation of the residuals (which remains after removing the effects which are already explained by the earlier lag(s)) with the next lag value hence ‘partial’ and not ‘complete’ as we remove already found variations before we find the next correlation.\n\n### Autoregression Intuition\nConsider a time series that was generated by an autoregression (AR) process with a lag of k.We know that the ACF describes the autocorrelation between an observation and another observation at a prior time step that includes direct and indirect dependence information.This means we would expect the ACF for the AR(k) time series to be strong to a lag of k and the inertia of that relationship would carry on to subsequent lag values, trailing off at some point as the effect was weakened.We know that the PACF only describes the direct relationship between an observation and its lag. This would suggest that there would be no correlation for lag values beyond k.This is exactly the expectation of the ACF and PACF plots for an AR(k) process.\n\n## Moving Average Intuition\nConsider a time series that was generated by a moving average (MA) process with a lag of k.Remember that the moving average process is an autoregression model of the time series of residual errors from prior predictions. Another way to think about the moving average model is that it corrects future forecasts based on errors made on recent forecasts.We would expect the ACF for the MA(k) process to show a strong correlation with recent values up to the lag of k, then a sharp decline to low or no correlation. By definition, this is how the process was generated.For the PACF, we would expect the plot to show a strong relationship to the lag and a trailing off of correlation from the lag onwards.Again, this is exactly the expectation of the ACF and PACF plots for an MA(k) process.\n\n## Summary\nFrom the autocorrelation plot we can tell whether or not we need to add MA terms. From the partial autocorrelation plot we know we need to add AR terms and here we plot the acf and pacf plots and select the p,q point where the correlation line first hits the error/zero band","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Building AUTO ARIMA model\n\nFor building the auto arima model,first let's split our training and testing data.

This is done by selecting cutoff points in the history, and for each of them fitting the model using data only up to that cutoff point. We can then compare the forecasted values to the actual values. This figure illustrates a simulated historical forecast on the Peyton Manning dataset, where the model was fit to a initial history of 5 years, and a forecast was made on a one year horizon.\n\n<img src=\"https://facebook.github.io/prophet/static/diagnostics_files/diagnostics_3_0.png\">\n\nThis cross validation procedure can be done automatically for a range of historical cutoffs using the cross_validation function. We specify the forecast horizon (horizon), and then optionally the size of the initial training period (initial) and the spacing between cutoff dates (period). By default, the initial training period is set to three times the horizon, and cutoffs are made every half a horizon.\n\nThe output of cross_validation is a dataframe with the true values y and the out-of-sample forecast values yhat, at each simulated forecast date and for each cutoff date. In particular, a forecast is made for every observed point between cutoff and cutoff + horizon. This dataframe can then be used to compute error measures of yhat vs. y.\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">  \nHere we do cross-validation to assess prediction performance on a horizon of 365 days, starting with 1095 days of training data in the first cutoff and then making predictions every 180 days.  \n</div>\n<br>\n ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Cross validation for the parameter days\nreliance_cv=cross_validation(model,initial='1095 days',period='180 days',horizon=\"365 days\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Performance metric\n\nHere we check the performance of our model with root mean squared value and plot it","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Checking the parameters\nreliance_performance=performance_metrics(reliance_cv)\nreliance_performance.head()\n\n\n#Plotting for root mean squared metric\nfig=plot_cross_validation_metric(reliance_cv,metric='rmse')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the results we can understand the rmse value lies between 0-500 which is not great and not terrible considering the stock prediction as it is very uncertain to the the right value of prediction","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-six\"></a>\n# Conclusion\nFrom the analysis, we can understand what are all the factors which is being undergone while working on a time-series project. Time series result's aren't the supreme way to tell accurate results as anything can happen to worsen or brighten up the stock market and the predictions aren't 100% reliable.But we can easily understand and derive from the past data and associate it with time and figure out why the event happened ? .\n\nComing to the context with our project, We saw how Reliance has risen from the ashes after being gravely hit in mid 2000's and now the company is at it's prime condition partnering with Facebook and Google revolutionizing the telecommunication, retail, technology, petroleum and many more to their portfolio. I beleive that reliance will become an Indian brand identity among the international market\n\n#### Thank you for reading my notebook.

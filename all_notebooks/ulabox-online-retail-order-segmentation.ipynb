The dataset has been made public on Kaggle with this description:\n\n> ** Context: **\n>Ulabox is the most successful pure-player online grocery in Spain.

A sugar tax, for example, is a required cost for the consumer, not an offset to a discount. It would be better if the discount and recharge amounts had been kept separate.

This is a technique to quantify a word in documents, we generally compute a weight to each word which signifies the importance of the word in the document and corpus. This method is a widely used technique in Information Retrieval and Text Mining.**\n\nTF-IDF for a word in a document is calculated by multiplying two different metrics:\n\n- The term frequency of a word in a document. There are several ways of calculating this frequency, with the simplest being a raw count of instances a word appears in a document. Then, there are ways to adjust the frequency, by length of a document, or by the raw frequency of the most frequent word in a document.\n\n- The inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. This means, how common or rare a word is in the entire document set. The closer it is to 0, the more common a word is. This metric can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and calculating the logarithm.\n\nSo, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1.\n\n**The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is balanced by the frequency of the word in the corpus.**\n\nTypically, the tf-idf weight is composed of two terms: Term Frequency (TF), aka. The number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document and **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**, computed as the logarithm of the number of the documents in the corpus divided by the number of documents where the specific term appears.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 42)\n\ntfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(use_idf = True, stop_words = 'english')\n\nX_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train['url_text'])\nX_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test['url_text'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-29T17:41:40.496632Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-29T17:41:40.497001Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.304542Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-29T17:41:40.496979Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.303602Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tfidf_train = pd.DataFrame(X_train_tfidf.A, columns = tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names())\ntfidf_train.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.305941Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.306365Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.750283Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.306309Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-29T17:41:41.749111Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Above is the representation of the **tf-idf matrix**.

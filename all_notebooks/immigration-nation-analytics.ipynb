After watching the documentary, I wanted to look into the numbers and practice further with data visualization (specifically Matplotlib and Seaborn) since I am a beginner.\n\nFor more information on the history of ICE and for further analysis questions, go to the following link <a href = \"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k5YfxKwkbJxaupkxbGBQVvx_EQZGDDp9tJ9KFR-Au_A/edit?usp=sharing\" target = \"_blank\">here</a>. I created this PowerPoint presentation for my documentary club, which also includes review questions to discuss.\n\nThe following tables I found regarding the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended and deported are from the Department of Homeland Security. They are imported from the **2019 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics**:\n<blockquote>The 2019 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics is a compendium of tables that provide data on foreign nationals who are granted lawful permanent residence (i.e., immigrants who receive a “green card”), admitted as temporary nonimmigrants, granted asylum or refugee status, or are naturalized. The Yearbook also presents data on immigration enforcement actions, including apprehensions and arrests, removals, and returns.</blockquote>\n\nThe tables that will be analyzed:\n<ul>\n<li><a href = \"https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2019/table33\" target = >Table 33</a>.

Matplotlib, in this case, was the better visualization tool in viewing the trends throughout the years.\n\nFor instance, a spike in the early 1950s shown in both tables (the first two tables) for the number of immigrants deported or apprehended reflects the immigration history around that time period. In 1954, the program called Operation Wetback used military-style tactics to remove Mexican immigrants — some of them American citizens — from the United States. Operation Wetback was primarily a response to pressure from a broad coalition of farmers and business interests concerned with the effects of Mexican immigrants living in the United States without legal permission.\n\nSource: Wikipedia (<a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wetback\" target = \"_blank\">Operation Wetback</a>)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

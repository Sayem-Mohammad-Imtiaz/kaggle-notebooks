Business Issue Understanding **  \nQ1: Whether we should encourage customers reviews in order to get more subscribers? \n\n**2.

Analysis Modeling **  \n**1) What analysis method should we use?**  \nTo get the the answer of the business question, we need to find out wether there is a positive relationship between num_reviews and num_subscribers.  \nTherefore, a correlation test can be used to testify their relationship. \n  \n**2) What is correlation test?**  \nCorrelation test is used in data analysis to better understand the relationship between variables. There are three kinds of correlations:  \n**Positive Correlation:** both variables change in the same direction   \n**Neutral Correlation:** no relationship in the change of the variables   \n**Negative Correlation: **variables change in opposite direction \n\n**<font color=#0099ff >3) Run correlation test in Python</font>**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# read data \ncourses_df = pd.read_csv('../input/udemy-courses/udemy_courses.csv')\n# general info of this data\ncourses_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It seems we have perfect data, no null, no messy, like a day dream! haha~ ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the y-axis, y = num_subscribers\ntemp_df1 = courses_df['num_subscribers']\ny1 = temp_df1.values\n\n# get the x-axis, x = num_reviews\n# x_reviews\nreview_df = courses_df['num_reviews']\nx1 = review_df.values\n\n# draw scatter plot \nplt.xlabel('num_reviews')\nplt.ylabel('num_subscribers')\nplt.scatter(x1,y1)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see the scatter plot above,most plots are centered where num_reviews are less than 10000.  \nTo get clear presentation, we can try to **filter data with num_reviews <= 10000**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the num_subcribers and num_reviews column \ntemp_df2 = courses_df.iloc[:,[5,6]]\n\n# filter these two columns with num_reviews <= 10000\nfilter_cols = temp_df2[temp_df2['num_reviews']<=10000]\n\n# get the new x,y axis after filter \ny2 = filter_cols['num_subscribers'].values\nx2 = filter_cols['num_reviews'].values\n\n# draw the trendline this time\nslope, intercept, r, p, std_err = stats.linregress(x2,y2)\ndef myfunc(x2):\n    return slope * x2 + intercept\n\nmymodel = list(map(myfunc,x2))\n\nplt.plot(x2,mymodel)\n\n# draw scatter plot again\nplt.xlabel('num_reviews')\nplt.ylabel('num_subscribers')\nplt.scatter(x2,y2)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looks more clear now! you can try to change the filter condition to see different scatter version.

Conclusion **  \nThere is high positive relationship between num_reviews and num_subscribers. For business insight, it’s highly possible that we can get more subscribers of a new course if we have more customer reviews of that course.

From the scatter plot of correlation test above, we already seen there is linear relationship between the two variables: num_subscribers and num_reviews. Therefore, we can use linear regression model to predict dependent variable - the number of subscribers based on independent variable - number of reviews.  \n\n**What does linear regression model look like?**  \nDependent Variable = Independent variable * slope + intercept","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=4>Les's Start!</font>  \n\n**1.

Validation of the model**  \nTo validate this model, we can calculate the “p-value” and “r-squared value” of this model.  \n\n**1) What is p-value and r-squared value?**  \nSimply, p-value indicates if there is a significant relationship between variables described by the model. The lower the p-value is, the more significant the relationship is. We often consider p-value below 0.05 as a significant level.  \nR-squared value measures how well the data is explained by the model. It indicates the proportion of the variability in the dependent variable that is explained by model. For example, r-squared of 0.40 indicates that 40% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model. The value of r-square ranges from 0 to 1.

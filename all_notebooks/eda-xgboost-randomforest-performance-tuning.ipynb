Thus, it exploits the dependency between the models and different from Bagging(RandomForest).\n\n**XGBoost:** Xgboost is an extension to GBM, for better speed and performance. It is trained in additive manner. It prevents the overfitting, and outliers. for xgboost we also no need to impute missing values, it takes care of that too.

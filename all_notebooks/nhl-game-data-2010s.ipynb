I created the following notebook to serve as both an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a Pandas tutorial that covers some important Pandas functions and syntax.\n\nIn the world of sports, it has been a long-standing debate as to whether or not \"homefield advantage\" is real in professional sports. In other words, does your team have an advantage over another team when playing at your home venue as opposed to the opponent's home venue? This question is tough to answer in professional sports because the level of talent and competition is so high.\n\nIn this exercise, you will utilize game data from the National Hockey League (NHL) over the course of the 2010's decade to gain more insight on the homefield advantage question, at least as it relates to hockey. \n\nCoded solutions are posted in the proper order with comments. If you are looking for a challenge, try following the analysis wihtout looking at the solution code.

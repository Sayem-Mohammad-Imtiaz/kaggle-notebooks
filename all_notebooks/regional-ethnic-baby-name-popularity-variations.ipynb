Some of the rest of the names on this list are all-around popular names (like \"Mathew\") that are actually more popular in New York City than you would expect. These variations are probably true regional variations: \"Mathew\" just happens to *even more popular than average* in large cities on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nNote that a little bit of the variation comes from sampling differences between our datasets: the United States baby names are from 2008, while the NYC baby names are from 2011-2014.

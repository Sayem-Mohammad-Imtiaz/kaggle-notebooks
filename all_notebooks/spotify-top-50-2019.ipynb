For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\n* **Liveness** = Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n* **Loudness** = The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude).\n* **Speechiness** = Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's rename the columns for better readablity and delete the unnecessary \"Unnamed: 0\" column as well as the ones that we will not be analysing:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.rename(columns={\"Loudness..dB..\":\"Loudness\",\n                     \"Speechiness.\":\"Speechiness\",\n                     \"Track.Name\":\"Track\",\n                     \"Artist.Name\":\"Artist\"},inplace=True)\ndata.drop([\"Unnamed: 0\",\n          \"Valence.\", \n          \"Acousticness..\",\n          \"Beats.Per.Minute\", \n          \"Length.\"], axis=1,inplace=True)\n\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Low energy songs like Senorita may also have a higher danceablity factor, while catchy songs like Ariana's 'boyfriend' may have high energy and low danceablity.

To construct a relevent dashboard, one must draw draw from a regularly-updated source, identify metrics which are important important to the mission of the company or goal, and show information which is relevant to decision-making. Dashboards can also show the results of changes which have been made internally in order to support rapid implementation of data driven decisions. \n\nThe dataset I have chosen is the [New York Bus Breakdown and Delays](http://https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/ny-bus-breakdown-and-delays) dataset. I chose this dataset because I am passionate about the educational industry as a whole, including the often neglected everyday hereos in the operational components. \n \n As a part of this dashboard exercise and as a fictional representative of the school bus industry, I will delineate the following topics:\n \n* The goals of your organization (like users or measures of pollution)\n    The goal of my organization is to determine the trends in school bus break-down rates by location and service, in order to improve and quote accurate commute times of students in New York state.  \n\n* Things that you (or your colleagues) can change to affect those goals (like advertising spending or the number of factory inspections)\nMy colleagues and I can change the number and quality of busses, the route taken, the lines of communcation, and the training of bus-driving personnel. \n\n* Thing you can't change but that will affect the outcome (like the school year, or weather conditions)\nMy colleagues and I cannot change the drop-off times, traffic congestion, random mechanical failures, school year dates, weather & climate, and school district budgets. \n\n**Let's begin** by loading in the lastest updated dataset. Thank you for reading!\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8dafb3c20d8f9eaa3997ab05d9ae624b04df0d64"},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Load in dataset, and see information ##\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/bus-breakdown-and-delays.csv\")\nprint(df.info())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2a3f0b8f99216e5c0cf46bc91c945639a8a0c36e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With 44.4MB of memory, this isn't a gigantic dataset, but it's often useful to inspect each column to get a feel for the data types, and appropriately categorize them.

This is highly problematic and I would like to diagnose the root cause behind this decline in travel bookings. \n* From [exploratory data analysis](https://public.tableau.com/profile/malcolmng#!/vizhome/ArgoSolutions/Dashboard), we see that the decline in bookings (and revenue) is happening at the same rate across all dimensions regardless of company, agency, gender, fare class, origin, and destination. Further analysis across different measures show that number of users (customer base) have also been declining. Therefore we can conclude that the decline in sales is driven by lower volume, which in turn is driven by a dwindling customer base. We need to address this issue across all customer segments and flights.\n* Let's assume one possible use case is that business travellers need to book hotels together with flights. This is quite a reasonable assumption as most companies do allow travel to be expensed. In this case, it would be useful to dive into all paired bookings and its trend over time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Solutions\nPossible solutions to improve paired bookings (flights + hotels) customer experience prioritized according to its impact on our selected business objective of conversions (bookings) vs effort (actionable):\n* attractive cta for bundled hotel + flight packages (with discount) on home screen (top of funnel) a la expedia\n* prompt user with recommended list of hotels at destination upon checkout completion for flight only booking i.e. airlines\n* force all users to make bundled hotel + flight packages bookings i.e. travel agency"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Validation Metrics\nSince our goal is to improve conversions, I would use the following success metrics to measure the success of my solution:\n* total number of bookings over time\n* proportion of bookings that are hotel + flights bundles vs flights only over time\n* various drop-offs rates along the funnel from home -> flights -> hotels -> checkout etc.\n\nI would either perform pre/post analysis or a/b test my solution on a selected sample of users to test my solution"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nprint(\"Setup Complete\")\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom datetime import datetime","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import data tables\nusers = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/argodatathon2019/users.csv')\nhotels = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/argodatathon2019/hotels.csv')\nflights = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/argodatathon2019/flights.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"users.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"hotels.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"flights.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# join tables\ndf = pd.merge(flights, hotels, how='inner', on=['userCode', 'travelCode'])\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# data aggregation\ndf['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_x'], format='%m/%d/%Y').dt.month\ndf['year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_x'], format='%m/%d/%Y').dt.year\n# df.groupby(['year', 'month']).count()\ndf['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_x'], format='%m/%d/%Y')\ndf.set_index('date', inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# visualize \nbookings = df.resample('1m').nunique()['travelCode']\n\n# Set the width and height of the figure\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,6))\n\n# Add title\nplt.title(\"Monthly travel bookings (flight + hotel)\")\n\n# Line chart showing monthly number of paired travel bookings\nsns.lineplot(data=bookings)\n\n# Add label for horizontal axis\nplt.xlabel(bookings.index.name)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

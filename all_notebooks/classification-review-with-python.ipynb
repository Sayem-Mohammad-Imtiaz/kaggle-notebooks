While regression predicts continuous outputs, classification predicts categorical outputs.

Information gain can be understood as the difference between the impurity of a parent node and the sum of impurities of its child nodes. Thus, less impurity on child nodes, more information gain.\n\nRandom Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Ensemble is a method that combines many models. The final prediction can be, for example, the average of them (regression) or the majority votes (classification). Random Forest consists in a group of decision trees built on samples of training dataset. More specifically, what happens is a sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling, bagging ensemble  method).\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Random_forest_diagram_complete.png)\n\n\nBut why \"random\"? Because at each split, instead of choosing the feature that maximize de information gain **among all features**, will be considered only a **random subset** of the features.

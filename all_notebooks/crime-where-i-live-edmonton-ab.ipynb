I wonder if that curve matches with conditions in the economy or with the price of Oil, since our economy here in Alberta is closely tied to oil. For part 2 of this analysis we could begin finding that data and mapping it to see if the trends are similar. Edmonton Police could then alternate resources in times of economic hardship to prevent some of these incidents. We could expand our analysis to go into the quarterly figures to see if there are increased thefts at different times of year. Are there more incidents in the summer when the weather overnight does not drop to freezing? Are there more incidents around the holidays when people scramble and times can be tough? These analysis can help Police make resource allocation decisions at different times and could lead to more success in preventing incidents. \n\nI wonder what kind of policy decisions the Edmonton Police Service made before and after the ups and downs related to theft. I remember some campaigns about locking your cars and keeping valuables out of sight. Maybe those had an impact in the years? As a next step we could write some language processing functions to look for policy changes to reduce theft, break and enter or robberies. We could focus on the years prior to the large drops in the rate and see if there was a specific initiative that led to such drops and then again any policy changes prior to the increases to see if there was a specific policy that helped curb some of these incidents.\n\nIt would appear that theft seems to be heading towards homes and vehicles in current years with robberies decreasing from 200 to the 120-140 range and remainign stagnant there since 2011, while other theft categories and break and enter follow that same U trend, increasing in most recent years. What policy changes have remained in place around robberies vs. what policy changes have been made around other theft categories? Comparing these could give us insight as to why rates have increased. \n\nSexual assault rates have followed an upwards trend. This could be a result of increased incidents of sexual assaults or increased reporting of sexual assaults, something that  has been a known difficulty for victims to do for many reasons. We could again scan policy changes or news articles to see if the Edmonton Police Service has had any initiatives around this. What changes in Edmonton culture have happened in the last 10 years that could be contributing factors? There could be news articles or information from advocacy groups that may help shed some light. Has victim support been positive or negative in the City? Has it led to more or less incident reports?\n\nWhat happened to the homicide rate in 2011 to create such a huge spike? We could scan news articles to see if there was some kind of gang war that would have driven homicides up in that particular year as they generally remain stagnant year over year.\n\nIt feels like the only conclusion I can reliably come to is that more analysis is definitely needed. I will do my best to dig deeper into each of the rate graphs and try to find more information about the various categories and certain intiatives that may have led to decreases or increases in the rates.\n\nIt would also make sense to group some of these incident types together. Grouping the theft categories together could provide us insight into types of incidents that could have strong correlations. Do theft of vehicle, theft from vehicle and theft over $5000 follow the same general trends? More analysis required and more to come on this.\n\nThis being my first ever Kernal I would love to hear suggestions on improving code or better explaining my code/thoughts. Thank you to those who read it and for those of you on the learning path as I am, I hope I was able to help you learn something.\n\nIf you are completely brand new, Kaggle Learning (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) is about as good as it gets for free knowledge specifically focused on data science.\n\nTo learn Python I completed the Python Masterclass taught by Tim Buchalka (https://www.udemy.com/share/1000dOBUEZd1lWQ3w=/ ).\n\nBest of luck to you all. \n\nRegards,\n\nRicardos Moussallem"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

I would have guessed Coyotes and Sabres would be high as well, but I'm a little surprised to see Chicago as high as it is.\n\nObviously the real value of draft picks shouldn't be linear like that since there's a pretty quick dropoff in the players ability to make the NHL if they aren't taken in the first round.\n\nI wanted to examine that, and I think the graph below show just how far and fast it drops off when we look at average NHL games played over the years by each pick.

The data starts to get a little more interesting.

Apriori algorithm"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Explanation of the algorithm:\n\n    The Apriori algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that is used to obtain information about the structured relationships between the different elements involved. It is a data mining technique used to extract frequent item sets and relevant association rules.\n\nThings to know before implementation:\n\n**Association rule:**\n\nIdentification of frequent patterns and associations (relationships) between a set of elements.\n\n             \n**Support.**\n\nIt simply measures how popular an item is as measured by the proportion of transactions in which it appears. It is a metric derived from the frequency of a certain set within the data set. By selecting this parameter we select the frequency of transactions necessary for the rule to take effect.\n\n\n**Trust.**\n\nThis indicates the probability that element will be executed and, when element X has been processed, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears.\n\nOne drawback of the confidence measure is that it could misrepresent the importance of a partnership. This is because it only explains how popular item X is, but not Y. If item y is also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing X will also contain it, thus inflating the measure of confidence.\n\n**Lift.**\n\nThis indicates the probability that item Y will be purchased when item X is purchased, while monitoring the popularity of item Y."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 4.1 Parameterization with lift> 2, confidence> 0.4 and support> 0.03\n\nWe are going to run the ariori algorithm with min_support (0.03), min_confidence = 0.4, min_lift = 2 to see the associations that the algorithm finds with a minimum of robustness."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"association_rules = apriori(transactions, min_support=0.03, min_confidence=0.4, min_lift=2)\nassociation_results = list(association_rules)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Funci√≥n para generar el DataSet\ndef inspect(results):\n    lhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][0])[0] for result in results]\n    rhs         = [tuple(result[2][0][1])[0] for result in results]\n    supports    = [result[1] for result in results]\n    confidences = [result[2][0][2] for result in results]\n    lifts       = [result[2][0][3] for result in results]\n    return list(zip(lhs, rhs, supports, confidences, lifts))\n\n\nApriori = pd.DataFrame(inspect(association_results), columns = ['Left Hand Side', 'Right Hand Side', 'Support', 'Confidence', 'Lift'])\n\nApriori['Transaction']= Apriori['Left Hand Side']+\"--\"+Apriori['Right Hand Side']\nApriori.sort_values(by='Lift',inplace=True,ascending=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Apriori","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the selected parameters, the a priori algorithm has only found 7 rules ordered by their Lift score.

For example, let's take a look at rule number 2.\n\n   - The second value, rhs, corresponds to the Beatles, the artist predicted by a priori who is heard in association with Bob Dylan.\n   \n   \n   - The third value, support, is the number of transactions, which include these two elements, divided by the total number of transactions. (As described above when we chose the parameters for Apriori). Thus, of the total transactions, 3.4% corresponds to Bob Dylan with The Beatles.\n   \n      \n   - The fourth value, confidence, is the percentage probability that the rule will be maintained. It tells us, of all the transactions that contain bob dylan, how often they also incorporate The Beatles. In this case it is 49.71%.\n   \n     \n   - The fifth value, lift, gives us the independence / dependency of a rule. It takes into account the trust value and its relationship to the entire data set. The lift is the increase in the probability of listening to The Beatles with the knowledge that Bob Dylan has been heard on the probability of hearing The Beatles without any knowledge of the presence of Bob Dylan. A lift value greater than 1 guarantees a high association between {Y} and {X}. The higher the value of the lift, the greater the chances of hearing an artist Y if the user has already listened to an artist X.

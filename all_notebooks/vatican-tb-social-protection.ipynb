The crisis is putting excessive financial strain on developing nations. The worldwide economic crisis, presents a unique challenge that has upset the balance of the world economy. \n\nWidespread lockdowns have led to a “deep supply shock”, since many factories and production facilities have been forced to close. Lockdowns have also caused “consequent demand shocks”, which are the result of people having less money to spend because of vast job layoffs and corporations being unwilling to commit to long-term investment plans due to economic uncertainties.\n\nThe crisis will more severely affect the lives and livelihoods of those in the developing world. One way to ease the misery of people in poorer nations, would be to tackle “the crippling external debt burdens” they have accumulated in recent years.\n\nThe Vatican representative urged the international community to “deliver speedy and substantive debt relief to crisis-stricken developing countries”.\n\n#“All nations be put in a position to meet the greatest needs of the moment through the reduction, if not the forgiveness, of the #debt burdening the balance sheets of the poorest nations.” Quote from Pope Francis’ Urbi et Orbi message of 12 April 2020.\nhttps://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2020-07/vatican-unctad-statement-renewing-appeal-for-debt-relief.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#

Although they do not have a validated immune correlate of BCG vaccine efficacy, they know from studies of host-genetic susceptibility that cellular immunity plays a critical role in protection from TB disease. Defects in the IFN-γ and IL-12 pathways, T cell and NK cell defects (GATA2 deficiency- Guanine-adenine-thymine-adenine 2) and defects in monocytes and dendritic cells (IRF8 deficiency and CGD) are associated with susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. Vaccination with BCG leads to the expansion of both classical antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and non-classical cells such as CD1 and HLA-E restricted T cells13. There is also an NK response following immunization with BCG, likely driven by IL-2 secretion from mycobacterial antigen specific CD4+ T cells14. BCG can modify the innate immune response through induction of epigenetic changes in monocytes and dendritic cells15. A role for BCG vaccine induced IFN-γ in protection from TB disease has been suggested in an infant study where both BCG-specific IFN-γ secretion and Ag85A specific IgG were associated with lower risk of developing TB disease. The BCG vaccine can therefore interact and modify all the key immune cells and pathways identified in human genetic studies to be critical for protection from TB disease.\nhttps://f1000research.com/articles/7-224","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcS-vihuJABPaMlY8hVrDtOQkRVkHj093gdzOQ&usqp=CAU)pt.slideshare.net","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The role of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors on immunity\n\nSocioeconomically disadvantaged populations face both material and psychosocial threats to adequate host immunity. Stress is defined as an event or environmental demand that exceeds an individual’s perceived ability to cope, eliciting physiological stress responses from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system to deal with the threat. There is abundant evidence from developed countries that chronic stressors and negative emotions such as anxiety and depression directly influence the immune system, including greater susceptibility to viral and bacterial infection and inhibited response to vaccines. These stressors have also been found to be associated with other biomarkers of immunity and inflammation including TNFA, IL6 and IL1B, decreased NK cell function, as well as impaired control over latent viral infections. Increased monocyte counts and monocyte to lymphocyte ratios have also been found in individuals with depressive symptoms, a common consequence of chronic stress and social deprivation. Importantly for vaccination of infants, prenatal maternal stress has been shown to influence postnatal immunity in offspring, though this literature is currently more developed in animals than in humans. Despite the high burden of deprivation and psychosocial stressors in areas where TB is endemic, the links between these exposures and biological immune response to BCG vaccine has not been explored.\n\nRecent work suggests that CD4+ T cell activation is associated with risk of TB in BCG vaccinated infants in South Africa, with CMV infection emerging as one important driver of this T-cell activation. These associations suggest a testable pathway from socioeconomic status and maternal stress, CMV reactivation, and impaired immune response to BCG vaccine in infants. https://f1000research.com/articles/7-224","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#word cloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator\ntext = \" \".join(str(each) for each in vatican.Country)\n# Create and generate a word cloud image:\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_words=200,colormap='Set3', background_color=\"black\").generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n# Display the generated image:\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='Bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.figure(1,figsize=(12, 12))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#TB prevention: a “social technology” approach\n\nIt could be argued that poverty reduction strategies, such as social protection, directly impacting socioeconomic status and maternal mental health could potentially play a role in increasing BCG efficacy.

Social protection includes widely used poverty-reduction strategies in both low and middle-income countries and encompasses both social security and social assistance interventions. In the latter group, cash transfer interventions are currently the most popular form of social protection. More recent literature suggests that cash transfers can significantly improve maternal mental health as well as self-perceived happiness among beneficiaries, pointing to potential benefits on biological markers of stress and immunity.\n\nThe ultimate goal of that research effort is the development and testing of a new vaccine R&D model based on the combination of innovative biotechnology tools with poverty reduction strategies, using BCG as proof of concept. They argue that such an innovative paradigm can provide crucial insights into how social factors manifest biologically via immune response to TB vaccine and potentially help explain the puzzle of wide variation in responses.\n\n#Conclusions\n\nRecent simulations suggest that if existing biomedical tools, including current BCG, were combined synergistically with social protection interventions, this could result in a significant acceleration in the decline of TB incidence globally. An interdisciplinary model that expands and integrates the understanding of how social determinants influence the biological processes that lead to TB disease, how this translates into differential BCG efficacy and, ultimately, how this influence can be affected by social protection interventions holds promise for reducing the global burden of TB disease. https://f1000research.com/articles/7-224","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata  @mpwolke","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

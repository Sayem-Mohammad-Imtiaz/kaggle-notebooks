One of the hotels (H1) is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel (H2). Both datasets share the same structure, with 31 variables describing the 40,060 observations of H1 and 79,330 observations of H2. Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled. Both hotels are located in Portugal: H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon\nour main aimfrom this project is to discover the data ,knowing the distributions of our features

include more factors in the dataset we can set a question in cancelation form asking customers to set a reason , that will be more helpful \n- by deeper research we can build a stronger model in future to predict the actual confirmed reservations which will help the managers be ready for the real demand \n- by deeper research we can advice the managers to improve choosing their agents and

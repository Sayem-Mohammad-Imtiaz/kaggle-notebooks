Is Any supervised machine learning possible ? if yes explain.\n\nAcording to me there is supervised machine learning is possible as \"Supervised learning\" is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n\nY = f(X)\n\nThe goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.\n\nIt is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\n\nIf we notice there is feature as Loan Amount and if we see correlation between Loam Amount and Applicant Income they are highly related from this feature we can predict a Loan Related Stuffs.\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

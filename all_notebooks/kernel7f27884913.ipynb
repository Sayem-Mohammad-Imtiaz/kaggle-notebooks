But its not very significant.\n\n2.Three students have scored maximum marks, of which two are girls and one is a boy. Based on the parents education and lunch type, all of them come from a privileged background. Also they belong to same ethnicity which may be a indication level of the quaity of students and teachers in the ethnicity.\n\n3.Student with minimum marks is an underprivileged student.\n\n4.Students with no preparation course and who are underprivileged performed poorly compared to the privileged one's.\nOut of the top ten students, 7 have completed test preparation course and all of them come from a privileged background.\nscores indicate that the privileged students performed much better than the underprivileged students in almost all subjects.\n\n5.The scores indicate that boys scored better in maths, but girls outshone boys on total_marks because of their domination in reading and writing scores.\n\n6.Of the total underprivileged children 89% have passed. 86.77% of the underprivileged girls have passed. 91.56% of underprivileged boys have passed.

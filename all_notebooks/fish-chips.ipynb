([source](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/uk-seaside-towns-beach-best-heatwave-summer-staycation-british-a8978111.html)).\nWe want to open a new Fish & Chips shop in **Bournemouth** to capitalise on its popularity with a food shop that is likely to be popular with the locals.\n\nThere are some considerations that we need to make when choosing where to open our new shop.\nWe want it to be in an area of the town where people would want to eat this kind of food.\nThat is, in an area that has lots of activities, such as drinking, shopping, and entertainment venues.\nPreferably, such an area would have few existing food venues, so that competition is as low as possible."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To tackle this problem, we need to understand what venues are already in Bournemouth, so that we can analyse them and decide on the best area in which to open our own shop.\nWe will use the [venue explore API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/explore) by Foursquare to gain insight into the existing venues in Bournemouth.\nWe will then categorize these venues into six high-level groups: `Drink`, `Entertainment`, `Food`, `Hotel`, `Shopping`, and `Transport`."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use these groups to understand how venues are dispersed by business type.\nThen, we will use [DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html), an unsupervised data

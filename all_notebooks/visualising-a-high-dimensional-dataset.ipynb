Indeed this task arises very often. For example, let's imagine that our goal is to understand which factors impact on the ranking of calls in the customer support call center using historical reports. The ranks are in a range from 1 and 5, which means that we have 5 classes. The obvious approach is to build the multi-class classification model in order to reach the goal. We may spend a lot of time trying to build an accurate model that distinguishes well between 5 classes in the target variable. What if after wasting a lot of time, we are still unable to achieve good results? May it happen that  we deal with a \"not well behaved\" class structures? Maybe we lack explanatory factors in the dataset?\nOf course, it is possible to analyze learning curves in order to understand if the model has a low or high variance of the parameter estimates across samples (bias-variance tradeoff) in order to conclude if more samples or more factors should be added to the dataset. However, there are other complementary approaches that may **help revealing \"not well behaved\" class structures at an early stage of the analysis**. This is what we are going to investigate in this notebook."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.manifold import Isomap\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1b5de9982a3bd5c5271e60b30b3f9bb4c3741b89"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

In our case we have only 13 independent features, but it will be enough to make a quick demo. To reach this goal, we will use dimensionality reduction methods.\n\nWhat is the dimensionality reduction? Dimensionality reduction methods convert the high-dimensional dataset into two or three-dimensional data that can be displayed, for example, in a scatterplot.  In other words, it means that we map each high-dimensional vector (in our case we deal with 13 dimensions + the target variable used for coloring the points) into a low-dimensional vector (e.g. 2D). \n\nThree different dimensionality reduction methods will be compared:\n\n* Principal component analysis (PCA)\n* Isometric Mapping\n* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8c3715d9fe44fd77f3dd89d3c4bef3e23dc29281"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Principal component analysis (PCA)\n\nPrincipal component analysis is the traditional dimensionality reduction technique that focuses on keeping the low-dimensional representations of dissimilar datapoints far apart.

Nonlinear dimensionality reduction means that components of the low-dimensional vector are given by non-linear functions of the components of the corresponding high-dimensional vector. Please refer to `help(Isomap)`in order to find more information about the parameters of Isomap.\n\nOne of the disadvantages is that the functionality of this algorithm depends almost on the choice of the number of neighbors.

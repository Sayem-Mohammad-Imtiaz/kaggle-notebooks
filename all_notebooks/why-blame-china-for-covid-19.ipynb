Introduction\n\nWhy should we not blame China for hiding coronavirus (COVID-19) information from the world in the first place? \n\n## 1.1 Project Description\n\nSince the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) had spread all over the whole world, I want to find out how the changes of new confirmed cases, new recovered, new deaths in the top 22 confirmed cases countries and my country, Taiwan. I use multiple linear regression to predict and fit between 23 countries, including US, Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, India, Iran, Peru, Canada, China, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Pakistan, Belgium, Qatar, Bangladesh, South Africa, and Taiwan. Then I compare the trends of these countries and try to explain the differences and why the result comes out.\n\n`Note:` The country sequence is listed as the confirmed cases ranking on May 26, 2020. These countries may go up and down, so I will not change the processing sequence of these countries.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2 The Dataset\nThe dataset source is from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset.

China once had more than 15000 new confirmed cases a day, but the number drastically down to only double digits in 10 days, which is believed that the report from China may be fake. According to the media and news during the period after the highest peak, Xi Jinping, the president of China, said the disease is under control. After then, the report of new confirmed cases is drastically down. Taiwan reached 27 new confirmed cases daily at maximum. That is because Taiwan prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak in advance, which makes it become the only country that can prevent the coronavirus spread out while Taiwan is the closest country to China.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.4 Choropleth map","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# pip install plotly==4.8.1\n# reference: https://towardsdatascience.com/visualizing-worldwide-covid-19-data-using-python-plotly-maps-c0fba09a1b37\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=go.Choropleth(\n    locationmode = \"country names\",\n    locations = correlationScores['Country'],\n    z = correlationScores['Correlation'],\n    text = correlationScores['Correlation'],\n    colorscale = 'matter',\n    reversescale=True,\n    colorbar_title = 'Correlation Score',\n))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text='COVID-19 TOP 22 Mutual Correlation Scores',\n    geo=dict(\n        showcoastlines=True,\n    ),\n)\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We show the correlation score on the world map.

The only two exceptions are China and Taiwan. As we all know, China government ignored and hid the disease at the very beginning time, and then it blocked the information from the world. In the end, the outbreak was boomed in Wuhan city, and the confirmed cases and deaths suddenly increased a lot. After that, President Xi Jinping controlled the media, news, and new confirmed cases. It is believed that the China government may report fake data to WHO when after Xi’s talk to the citizens in China.\n\nTaiwan is in the other situation. Taiwan suffered SARS in 2003. Since then, Taiwan has always prepared for another disease outbreak. So when Taiwan first heard there might be new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan in the early of January 2020, Taiwan government soon decided to build the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) to manage all the information about COVID-19. The CECC arranged many policies to prevent the disease from spreading and monitor people who may be in danger. It turns out to make the incredible few confirmed cases in Taiwan, although Taiwan is the closest country to China in the world. Do not forget that there are two to three million people fly to and back between China and Taiwan every year.\n\nAccording to the above reasons, other countries are not so aware of COVID-19 or China like Taiwan. Even the WHO also declared that this disease is not dangerous in the first. So other countries will not prepare for the outbreak because they believe WHO. But people in Taiwan never trust China and know that China actually controls WHO. Hence, Taiwan prepared for it in advance. The population of Taiwan is 23 million people but only has less than 500 confirmed cases and less than ten deaths, despite the island’s proximity to China, where the outbreak originated. It significantly showed why I said Taiwan indeed prevents the COVID-19 from spreading.\n\nEven if Taiwan has so few cases, it has a higher correlation score than China's. This is another evidence that China lies to the world and report the fake data regarding COVID-19.\n\nThese explanations tell us why the linear models trained by each country do not suit for China and Taiwan but suit other countries. The reasons are China’s data is not precise, and Taiwan’s situation is under control without any outbreak. We know that the first confirmed case in Taiwan is the same day as the first confirmed case in South Korea and Japan. But it turns out that South Korea has 11814 confirmed cases, and Japan has 17056 confirmed cases on June 08, which both are the severe COVID-19 affected area.\n\n## 5.2 Conclusion\nAccording to the trends and plots above, the top 22 confirmed cases countries have a similar situation since the disease appeared in those countries. The only exception is China in the top 22. By these comparisons, they showed the increasing of the new confirmed case would occur after 30 ~ 40 days since the first confirmed case. The linear models produced by all countries are properly suited for other countries except China and Taiwan. This means the COVID-19 outbreak has similar patterns in almost any country except China and Taiwan. For Taiwan, this is because it prepares and controls in advance before WHO’s announcement. For China, its strange patterns about the disease are obviously controlled by the communist government. Until now, the new confirmed cases are still not transparent in China. \n\nSo, why should we not blame China for hiding the coronavirus (COVID-19) information from the world in the first place? \nYes, we should blame China for its lie and dishonor behavior regarding COVID-19. The world needs to fight the disease together, but China only cares about its reputation without following international rules.\n\nThis project states how strange the new confirmed cases in China dramatically down are. The project also shows how different the pattern China has with other top 22 countries. By machine learning, we not only can train models to know the related features with new confirmed cases but also can use trained models to find similar patterns regarding the COVID-9 pandemic.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

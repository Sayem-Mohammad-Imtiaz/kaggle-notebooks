The loan amount is funded via the internet.  The major dataset is \"kiva_loans\" which provides major details about the loans given to different organizations or persons by Kiva. The Fields under this dataset are explained below:\n\n* **id** -  This is identity value for each row in the dataset.\n* **funded_amount** -  It is the amount which is funded by Kiva. As it is not necessary that all the amount asked for loan will be funded as whole.\n* **loan_amount** -  It is the loan amount asked by the borrower from the organization.\n* **activity** -  It is the work in which the borrower is engaged in .\n* **sector** -  The sector to which the borrowing organization or person belongs to.\n* **use** -  It is the purpose for which loan amount is needed.\n* **country_code** -  This is country code to which borrower belongs to.\n* **country** -  Name of the country to which borrower belongs.\n* **region** -  It is the region inside the country where the organization or person resides.\n* **currency** -  currency in which loan is lended by Kiva.\n* **partner_id** -  These are the unique id provided for field partners\n* **posted_time** -  It is the date and time when the loan was posted on Kiva.\n* **disbursed_time** -  It is the date and time when the loan was disbursed to the borrower.\n* **funded_time** -  It is the date and time when the loan was funded completely.\n* **term_in_months** -  Duration in months after which the loan has to be returned by the borrower.\n* **lender_count** -  Total number of lenders who have colaboratively funded the amount.\n* **tags** -  These are tags which describes the category of loan or loan type.\n* **borrower_genders** -  This is list having the gender of all the borrowers involved in a loan.\n* **repayment_interval** -  How frequently the amount of loan will be paid by the borrower.\n* **date** -  Date on which loan was posted.\n\n\n**Approach**\n\nI've basically find out 6 important features out of the available keys based on which we can try to understand the data. I'm projecting different insights based upon these 6 key features.\nRight now i've tried to show the data based on four features out of those which will be help us to understand meaningful information about the data.\nThese features are \n\n* Country - The country of the borrower who is getting the money from Kiva\n* Sectors -  Different sectors to which the borrowing entity belongs\n* Repayment Interval - This the interval after which the borrower has to pay back some amount of the loan.\n* Activity - This is the activity for which loan has been taken by the borrower. This is a kind of sub sector.\n\nInitially we'll have a look at the dataset and its features to get a better understanding of the approach that we'll be taking to analyse the data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#!/usr/bin/env python2\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n\"\"\"\n@author: Akshay Sharma\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\n\nplt.style.use('dark_background')\nloans_data = pd.read_csv('../input/kiva_loans.csv')\n\n\none_million = 1000000\none_thousand = 1000\none_hundred = 100\n\nprint(loans_data.keys())\nloans_data.head()","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a5add85-aa3c-45c5-b727-a1ee8fb1bd13","_uuid":"dfdb3873ad055fbc9b1c0321ec0aa8124312fe2d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we've defined two different functions GenderDataForSectors and countBorrowers which are used for finding the total borrowers,male borrower and female borrowers sector wise out of our data and count total number of borrowers overall respectively."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"27f57d0c-95c7-486e-8adf-4f56a274cec6","_uuid":"978d057db86026047f7bd5835650dd4e0b9ed8a8","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#From these attributes we can see that there are 18 features are available for the given data\n#Out of these 18 features we can majorly try to look data in terms of 6 features\n# sector,country,currency,partern_id,borrower-genders,repayment_interval\n# So we'll show the data based on these features\n#Right now i've projected data only based on 2 features other features i'll project soon\n\ndef GenderDataForSectors(sectors):\n    total_count = 0\n    sector_male = []\n    sector_female = []\n    for sector in sectors:\n       \n        current_sector = groupby_sectors.get_group(sector)['borrower_genders']\n        sector_data = countBorrowers(current_sector)\n       \n        total_count = total_count + sector_data[0]\n        sector_male.append(sector_data[1])\n        sector_female.append(sector_data[2])\n    return [total_count,sector_male,sector_female]\n\ndef countBorrowers(sector):\n    item_count = 0\n    male_count = 0\n    female_count = 0\n    for item in sector.dropna() :\n        array = [s.replace(' ','') for s in item.split(',')]\n        temp_array = np.array(array)\n        item_count = item_count + len(temp_array)\n        male_count = male_count + len(temp_array[temp_array == 'male'])\n        female_count = female_count + len(temp_array[temp_array == 'female'])\n\n    return (item_count,male_count,female_count)\n\n","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"37bfd4a4-00a5-44a2-9868-13afeef8d94f","_uuid":"dd7891397740e085ba05fd5c9466570a40460eff"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Sector-wise Data Analysis**\n\nHere we're going to visualize the data available based on the first key feature \"Sectors\".

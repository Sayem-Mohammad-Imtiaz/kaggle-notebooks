I include the **total EV (effort value) yield** becuase it usually coorelates to what \"stage\" that Pokemon is, for example for 3-stage evolution lines they are 1 to 3 for each stages, and for single stage legendary Pokemon it's usually 3. Also, this also works for the \"intermediate\" single stage Pokemon like Skarmory, Druddigon, and Torkoal, all of which have 2 total EV yield. \n\n`pc0` clearly shows how the stats of a Pokemon grows with stages. It also explains nealy 50% of the variation in the input data. By reverse the normalization and doing some calcuations with `pc0`, we can see that when total EV yield go up by 1, the total stat increases by about 176.9 in general.\n\nIn components besides `pc0`, `pc1` and `pc2` take up the main portion of the variation, both of which have nearly 0 on total EV yield, and explains 10% of the data variation. `pc1` shows the tradeoff between mainly **defence** and **speed**, which appears in game as the difference between *tanks* and *sweepers*. That is, Pokemon with more positive `pc1` components tent to be defensive, more balky, and take less damage, but at the same time slower and usually have less attack. On the other hand, Pokemon with more negative `pc1` components are faster, can hit before the opponents more easily, with the cost of lower defence and HP. \n\n`pc2` shows the difference between *physical-oriented* Pokemon and *special-oriented* Pokemon. In the game, there are 3 types of moves: *physical*, *special*, and *status*. *Physical moves* usually calculates its damage by physical stats (**attack** and **defense**), and *special move* by physical stats (**special attack** and **special defense**). *Status moves* inflict status on various objects, for example the user itself, the target, or even the game field. Some example of the effects of status moves includes increasing the attack of the user, decreasing the defense of the target, or alter the weather of the game field. Since effects of different types of moves depends on different stats, it's normal that player will catagorize Pokemon as more physical-oriented or more special-oriented. One example is the infamous \"SkarBliss\" combination, which includes Skarmory and Blissey:  ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df.name.isin(['Skarmory', 'Blissey'])]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since the reason given above, attackers are often either physical attacker of special attacker based on thier stats, which are then usually given the cooresponing type of moves. In the \"SkarBliss\" combination, Skarmory has high defense (physical wall) and Blissey has high special defense (special wall) and high HP. At the same time, Skarmory also has move that can set up entry hazard (damages opposing Pokemon when switch in) and force the oppenct to switch respectively (a role which is often called phaser). \n\n`pc5` and `pc6` are somewhat interesting. Although only take up 6% of the explained variation, both of them mostly increase the base stats while decreasing total EV yield. Further more, the increased stats are compliment in `pc5` and `pc6`, meaning Pokemon with positive `pc5` or `pc6` components will have higher stats compared to other pokemon with the same total EV yield.

Sanyam should use custom CTDS thumbnail which has had higher median click through rates compared to other thumbnails though it has had lesser impressions**\n\n2.A comparision of impressions and view tells us that the **higher the number of impressions the higher were the view** and episodes featuring an **Industry expert or Kaggler has had higher impressions**.Out of the 85 episodes , 40 episodes has featured Industry experts and 36 episodes have featured Kagglers .Going by this statistic , **irrespective of the experts , CTDS show as a whole has had higher impressions.**\n\n3.Click through rates  have been higher even when there were lower impressions which explains the fact that **CTDS has got strong subscribers from the community who tuned in to each episode.** Also,Median CTR's were nearly equal for a show featuring Industry experts and Reseachers followed by Kagglers.\n\n4.The average watch duration has been around 4-6 minutes across the episodes.The episode duration has hovered around 50 to 75 mins.The **average watch duration was higher for episodes featuring Kagglers and Industry experts which constitutes around 76 % of the total 85 epsiodes.**\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading the required libraries and data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nimport os\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#     for filename in filenames:\n#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kaggle=1\nif kaggle==1:\n    data=pd.read_csv('../input/chai-time-data-science/Episodes.csv')\n    yt_thumbnail=pd.read_csv('../input/chai-time-data-science/YouTube Thumbnail Types.csv')\nelse:\n    data=pd.read_csv('../data/Episodes.csv')\n    yt_thumbnail=pd.read_csv('../data/YouTube Thumbnail Types.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Summary of data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 85 rows and 36 columns .The episodes are defined by a unique episode_id key .A glimpse of that column provides an understanding that there were 75 episodes and 9 Mini-series .","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data[data['episode_id'].str.contains('M')][['episode_id','episode_name']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The mini-series episodes are about fast.ai course summaries and it has nine episodes in total.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Some Youtube Statistics Definitions","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we produce the results of the analysis , let me share the details of the youtube statistics columns.

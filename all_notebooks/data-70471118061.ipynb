Data Standardization:**\n\nStandardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation. Standardization can be helpful in cases where the data follows a Gaussian distribution. However, this does not have to be necessarily true.

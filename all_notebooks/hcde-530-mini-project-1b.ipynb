Conclusions/Directions for Future Work\n**Conclusions**\n\nAt the start of this notebook, I highlighted two key interests from the data:\n1. What is the average mass of meteors that fall to Earth yearly? Has it changed drastically over time?\n2. Has diversity of meteorite origin changed over time, and if so, how?\n\nThe first topic is addressed by the visualization for \"Meteorite Mass Statistics per Year\". In it, we can see that the average mass per year tends to fluctuate, but it seems to be increasing yearly. Not only that, the variability in meteorite masses per year has increased, which is denoted by the outliers and interquartile ranges of the boxplots.\n\nThe second is addressed by the visualization for \"Meteorite Type Diversity per Year\". There are an abudant number of categories that meteorites can be classifid into which typically depend on mineral composition and origin. The trendline for this scatter plot shows that the diversity of meteorite types is decreasing yearly.\n\n**Directions for Future Work**\n\nFirstly, future work should build on a wider timespan of meteorite events. The database I referenced has over 70,000 entries that span through centuries of recorded meteorites. However, webscraping the database was a bit troublesome, and due to the lack of a documented API I chose to reduce the timespan for my analysis. This equates to around 15,000 entries.\n\nI believe that future work for this project could involve a literature review that rationalizes why meteorite diversity seems to be dropping each year. There are numerous reasons why this could be occuring. For example, it could be that the the system of classification has changed radically over time, meteorite sampling and analysis has reduced over the years, or maybe even the interstellar bodies that produce unique meteorite types has shifted somehow. These reasons would all require an in-depth look into the current literature to suggest an accurate conclusion.","metadata":{}}]}

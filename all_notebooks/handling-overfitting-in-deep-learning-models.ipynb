In other words, the model learned patterns specific to the training data, which are irrelevant in other data.\nWe can identify overfitting by looking at validation metrics, like loss or accuracy. Usually, the validation metric stops improving after a certain number of epochs and begins to decrease afterward. The training metric continues to improve because the model seeks to find the best fit for the training data.\nThere are several manners in which we can reduce overfitting in deep learning models. The best option is to get more training data. Unfortunately, in real-world situations, you often do not have this possibility due to time, budget or technical constraints.\nAnother way to reduce overfitting is to lower the capacity of the model to memorize the training data. As such, the model will need to focus on the relevant patterns in the training data, which results in better generalization. In this post, we’ll discuss three options to achieve this."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Set-up of the project\n\nWe start by importing the necessary packages and configuring some parameters.

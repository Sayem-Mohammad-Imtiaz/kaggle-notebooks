It was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. On april 15th 1912 , under the command of Edward smith and carrying an estimate of 2,224 passengers and crew, the ship collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Killing over 1500 people, including her commander Edward smith and Architect Thomas Andrews. “May their Souls rest in Peace”\n* The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe who were seeking a new life in the United States. The Titanic carried women, men, children and teenagers of all ages from less than a year to 80yrs.The passengers paid different prices and also stayed in different cabins relative to their social and economic class.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\nThe Titanic data set  contains information collected from a sample of 891 passengers from a population of the estimated 2224 people who were aboard the titanic ship on the fateful day when the ship sunck.

I used the Titanic dataset to find out the characteristics of the passengers that let to their survival. The data that I used was from the public dataset, it maynot have been intended for that kind of research so their could have been some information that was left out that might have been good for the research.\n\n2. The dataset had missing age values, embarked and cabin. I used the mean with in social class and gender to take care of the missing age data this is a limitation because when you try to get statistics about the data for analysis the mean and median are not really what they are.\n\n3. The Parch column wasnt well described, the documentation says it shows how many parents a child has but we had people with 6 parents, so i wasnt sure if the variable was for relatives because i  dont think anyone can have 6 parents.\n\n4. Correlation is not causation. I used data to come up with conclusions, that are based on correlation, but there could be other factors that contributed to survival for example, the strenth of people, how athletic they are, their cultural background, level of education, past experience and race could have contributed to their survival.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Resources: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\n\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/jupiter/wiki/markdown_syntax/#md_ex_pre\n\nhttps://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html\n\nhttp://matplotlib.org/gallery.html#statistics\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","source":"","outputs":[]}],"nbformat_minor":1}

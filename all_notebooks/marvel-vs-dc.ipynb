However, Marvel films have been more popular than DC films, as Marvel films have received higher ratings than DC films in general. Especially, the president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, has invested more time on developing scripts and Marvel Universe. By this, Marvel films have well structured storyline and led this to receive more positive ratings from the audience. \n\nIn this analysis, I will try to solve the underlying questions that I've had:\n\n1. Which entity (or universe) has received higher average IMDb ratings?\n2. If the movie has higher IMDb rating, does it mean that it will lead to higher gross?\n3. What is the relationship between IMDb rating and Rotten Tomato rating?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-07T15:23:32.418765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-07T15:23:32.419181Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-07T15:23:32.429325Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-07T15:23:32.419147Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-07T15:23:32.427814Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before we analyze, I've browsed dataset named 'mdc.csv.'

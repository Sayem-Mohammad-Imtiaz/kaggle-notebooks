RACHAEL MAHMOOD - APRIL 27, 2020\n\n\"Taking time to check assumptions about family engagement can make a huge difference in the lives of your students and their caregivers.\"\n\n\"Research confirms that family involvement positively impacts students’ academic experiences. And in this moment of crisis, especially, engaging our students means engaging their families: Including caretakers is one way to support our students from a distance.\"\n\n\"More often, however, the examples caregivers used to describe their engagement did not align with what educators frequently identify as family involvement. Parents and guardians described teaching cultural lessons and supporting social emotional learning, for example. They engaged with their children’s schooling by relocating to change school districts and navigating social services to ensure their children’s needs were met.\"\n\n\"When designing engaging lessons, even the most well-intentioned teachers can make incorrect assumptions about family involvement. Not all caregivers are home with their children during this distance learning time. Many students are home alone, are being cared for by older children or are taking care of younger children. Caregivers who are at home may be adjusting to working remotely. Only a small percentage of students have a caregiver free of other responsibilities who can dedicate time to guiding them through their learning packets or navigating websites.\"\n\nhttps://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/rethinking-family-engagement-during-school-closures","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#COVID-19 and School Closures - One year of education disruption\n\n![](https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/report-small/public/resources-pdf-previews/1557862-COVID19-and-school-closures.png?itok=Rc_AOJ4g)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsattendancecsv/attendance.csv',encoding ='ISO-8859-1',sep=\";\")\ndf.tail()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T18:38:18.269667Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T18:38:18.270118Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T18:38:18.311349Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T18:38:18.270073Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T18:38:18.310264Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T18:38:50.459291Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T18:38:50.459646Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T18:38:50.470532Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T18:38:50.459617Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T18:38:50.469325Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"Of course caregivers want to be able to help their children. Many may feel guilt that they cannot be there to help with schoolwork or frustration that they can’t navigate the technology their children are required to use. \"\n\n\"Educators can increase opportunities for family engagement by being flexible. Providing students with menus of activities that they can pick from will help them to be more independent. And many caregivers prefer having a week’s worth of activities up front so that they can plan around their work schedules\"\n\n\"Instead of expecting caregivers to become teachers, educators can complement family engagement by partnering with caregivers to address children’s social and emotional needs. For families, educators can be the person who checks in on their child. Teachers can be there to talk to their child about all that is going on when they are busy trying to make ends meet. Teachers can be an advocate for their child when there is a need. \"\n\n\"It’s OK to put the worksheets down. It’s OK to spend time checking on your students. Families trust your expertise—use it to ease their stress rather than add to it during this crisis. Assure parents that you are there to support their children and that their children won’t miss any learning opportunities that cannot be made up when this moment

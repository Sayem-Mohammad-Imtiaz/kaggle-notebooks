We try not to rely on external libraries and build everything from scratch. All formulas used are based on the Bayes Theorem and no additional methods are used for accuracy improvement.\n\n### 1 Introduction\n\nUnwanted emails are a problem we face daily in modern society. \"Spam\" as we call it, is something that is encountered by almost anyone using the internet. But how can we deal with this problem? Sure, we could open each individual email and manually assess if it is spam or not, but what if there was another way? What if we could teach the computer to look at the emails for us and tell us ahead of time if it's spam or not? Something like a filter. A spam filter! Now that sounds really nice, but how could we do that? Fortunately for us, humans have had emails for decades, and such a filter already exists. Not only that, but it is in use by many email clients to this day. It is called Naive Bayes spam filter and what we'll do is try to recreate it from scratch and explain how it works along the way.\n\n### 2 In theory\n\n#### 2.1 Bayes Theorem  \n\nThe foundation on which Naive Bayes Filter is based on is a theorem called...you guessed it, Bayes' theorem. Expressed as a mathematical equation it looks like this.\n    \n$$ P(A | B)=\\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}, $$\n    \nwhere  $ A $ and $ B $ are events and $ P(B)\\neq 0 $\n \n* $ P(A | B) $ is a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $ A $ occurring given that $ B $ is true;\n\n* $ P(B | A) $ is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of event $ B $ occurring given that $ A $ is true;\n\n* $ P(A) $ and $ P(B) $ are the probabilities of observing $ A $ and $ B $ independently of each other; this is known as the marginal probability.\n\n#### 2.2 Bayes Theorem for spam filtering\n\nBut what does this theorem have to do with our spam filter? We want to find out what is the likelihood of a specific message to be spam. But a message consists of multiple words. In order to find the combined probability of the words we first have to find the probability of each separate word being a spam word. This is also known as the 'spaminess' of a word and we can calculate it by using one special case of Bayes Theorem where the event is a binary variable.\n\n$$ P(S | W) = \\frac{P(W | S)\\cdot P(S)}{P(W | S)\\cdot P(S) + P(W | H)\\cdot P(H)}, $$\n\nwhere,\n* $ P(S|W) $ is the probability that a message is a spam, knowing that a specific word is in it;\n* $ P(W|S) $ is the probability that the specific word appears in spam messages;\n* $ P(S) $ is the overall probability that any given message is spam;\n* $ P(W|H)  $ is the probability that the specific word appears in ham messages;\n* $ P(H) $  is the overall probability that any given message is ham.\n\n#### 2.3 Unbiased approach\n\nBut we want our filter to be unbiased toward incoming email, so we are going to assume that the probabilities of receiving both spam and ham are equal to 50%. This allows us to simplify the formula to the following:\n\n$$ P(S | W) = \\frac{P(W | S)}{P(W | S) + P(W | H)}, $$\n\nOur training dataset already has some marked mail, so we know the total number of spam and ham messages. All that's left to do is count in how many of the spam and ham messages respectively, the specific word is present.\n\n$$ P( W | S ) = \\frac{spam\\space messages\\space containing\\space the\\space word}{all\\space messages\\space containing\\space the\\space word} $$\n\n$$ P( W | H ) = \\frac{ham\\space messages\\space containing\\space the\\space word}{all\\space messages\\space containing\\space the\\space word} $$ \n\n#### 2.4 Combining probabilities\n\nNow, words in a message are usually not independent of each other, but for simplicity's sake we're going to assume that they are. Bearing that in mind, we can get the spam probability of the message if we combine the spam probabilities of all the words in it like this:\n\n$$ p=\\frac{p_{1} p_{2} \\cdots p_{N}}{p_{1} p_{2} \\cdots p_{N}+(1-p_{1})(1-p_{2}) \\cdots(1-p_{N})} $$\n\nwhere,\n* $ p $ is the probability that the suspect message is spam;\n* $ p_{1} $ is the probability $ p(S|W_{1}) $ that it is a spam knowing it contains some first word;\n* $ p_{2} $ is the probability $ p(S|W_{2}) $ that it is a spam knowing it contains some second word;\n* $ p_{n} $ is the probability $ p(S|W_{N}) $ that it is a spam knowing it contains some Nth word.\n\n#### 2.5 Corrections\n\nIn order to avoid floating-point underflow, we are going to use the alternative form of the formula which looks like this:\n$$ p=\\frac{1}{1+e^{\\eta}} $$\nwhere,\n$$ \\eta = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}[\\ln(1-p_{i})-\\ln p_{i}] $$\n\nWhat happens if we get a word that was never encountered in the learning phase? We get $ \\frac{0}{0} $. That's why we're going to ignore such words and carry on.\nRare words also cause problems to our calculations and a way to deal with this is to use a corrected probability:\n\n$$ P'(S | W) = \\frac{s \\cdot P( S ) + n \\cdot P(S | W)}{s  + n}, $$\nwhere,\n\n* $ P'(S | W) $ is the corrected probability for the message to be spam, knowing that it contains a given word;\n* $ s $  is the strength we give to background information about incoming spam;\n* $ P(S) $ is the probability of any incoming message to be spam;\n* $ n $ is the number of occurrences of this word during the learning phase;\n* $ P(S|W) $ is the spaminess of this word.\n\nWe use this corrected probability instead of the spaminess of the word and finally we get the probability that a message is spam. If it's greater than 50%, we classify the message as spam."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n### 3 In practice\n#### 3.1 Loading dependencies"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport collections\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 3.2 Loading dataset\nOur dataset consists of 5574 English SMS messages, 425 of them tagged as spam and 3,375 tagged as ham.\nIdeally, we want a bigger dataset with 50% spam and 50% ham, but this is what we have and it should be enough for a simple proof of concept."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mails = pd.read_csv('../input/sms-spam-collection-dataset/spam.csv', encoding = 'latin-1')\nmails.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 3.3 Cleaning dataset\nOf course what we do have is not perfect either, so we'll have to trim it up a little.\nFor example we don't need these columns, they are empty:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mails.drop(['Unnamed: 2', 'Unnamed: 3', 'Unnamed: 4'], axis = 1, inplace = True)\nmails.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can also rename these columns appropriately:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mails.rename(columns = {'v1': 'spam', 'v2': 'message'}, inplace = True)\nmails.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And let's turn our spam or ham column into one with boolean values:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mails['spam'] = mails['spam'].map({'ham': False, 'spam': True})\nmails.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 3.4 Splitting dataset\nNow let's just check for ourselves how much of our mail is spam and how much is ham:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mails['spam'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Later we'll need some data that is not part of our training model for testing the accuracy of our spam filter.

These are common words that occur in any text, like 'the', 'any', 'such', 'this'. They don't give us any information and we can get rid of them.\n* Now, since we're dealing with english text, we can check if our words are actually valid english words. That way we get rid of all the rare words in the model that don't help us anyway.\n* Finally, comes a thing called stemming. This is an algorithm that detects the \"core\" meaning of the word and gets rid of the rest. That way words like  'go', 'goes', 'going' will be replaced by a single 'go'.

We made a lot of assumptions that limit our model to a specific type of messages. For example we only consider English words as valid, but around 3/4 of the world population doesn't speak English. Or the fact that we took all the words from a message and assumed they have no connection to each other, but \"not okay\" is not the same as \"not\",\"okay\". Or what if a clever spammer uses the knowledge of our word processing and tries to change a few letter in each word so that we classify them as new words instead of spam. \"Ca11 n0w to have a gr8 t1me\" is not going to give us the same probability as \"Call now to have a great time\".\n\nWe made a simple proof of concept. However, all great spam filters have to start from somewhere and this is the foundation on which most of them are built on.\n\n\n### 5 References:\n\nDataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset\n\nEnglish words: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering\n\nhttps://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6467\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/spam-classifier-in-python-from-scratch-27a98ddd8e73\n\nhttps://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis391/Lectures/naive-bayes-spam-2015.pdf\n\nhttp://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~gabis/DocDiplome/Bayesian/000539771r.pdf\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall\n\nhttps://softuni.bg/trainings/2313/math-concepts-for-developers-april-2019\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-the-world-speaks-no-English"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Now, lets address my first exploratory question of what countries are producing the most startups.** \n\n**We'll use the `groupby` function. This allows us to split our dataset into certain groups, such as countries. From there, we can evaluate how many companies are *in* each group, with the `.size` function, which is known as a frequency count. Then, we'll order those values with the `sort_values` function. Within `sort_values`, we indicate that `ascending = False`, because we want our order to be high to low.**\n\n**I want to highlight the importance of order in this line of code. This strategy is known as split-apply combine, and you must follow that order. `Groupby` is the 'split', `.size()` is the 'apply', and `sort_values` applies to the 'combine'.**\n\n**We'll also use the `head()` function again, to give us an output of just the first 10 rows**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"startups.groupby(\"country_code\").size().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**4.

This is one of the most demanded places in the country where students come to finish their higher education and people of many kinds arrive to make a living out of a new job. This city provides a wide range of possibilities regarding properties to rent or to buy, depending on the *location*, *surface*, *comfort*, and other variables. \n\nIn this notebook, we will analyze what Bucharest had to offer during **September 2020** with respect to **rental** offers. Some of the questions we aim to answer are the following:\n- [Which are the areas with the most expensive rental, depending on the number of rooms the apartment has? But with the cheapest?](#question-1) \n  - This could imply extracting the distribution of prices among city's areas and number of rooms.\n- Which are the areas with the oldest buildings? But with the newest?\n- How is the comfort affected depending on the apartment's rooms partitioning?\n- Is there a correlation between price and the floor (level of building) where the apartment is found?\n- Are the prices imposed by property management agencies bigger than the ones imposed by private owners, with respect to apartment's surface?\n- Which is the distribution of useful surface depending on the number of rooms?"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load useful libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport pandas.core.nanops as nanops # work with NaN in dataframes\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting\nimport seaborn as sns; # sophisticated plotting","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Take a peek at the available data\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/bucharest-house-prices-september-2020/renting_houses_clean.csv')\ndata.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div id=\"question-1\"></div>\n\n# Most expensive / cheapest areas\n\n## Which are the areas with the most expensive / cheapest rental average?\n\nIn order to answer this question, we are going to create a table whose rows will represent location areas around Bucharest and columns represent the number of apartment's rooms.

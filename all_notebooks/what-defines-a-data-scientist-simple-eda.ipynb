{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction \n\nI recently had a chat with a friend of mine about *what defines a Data Scientist*. Given how much the term was thrown around and how much of a buzz word it's become, i thought it would be a good idea to tackle the question by exploring public datasets from Kaggle. \n\nTo this effect, I've used job postings from the US and the UK to understand what are the requirements for a Data Scientist. I will also be exploring what are the differences between similar occupations such as 'Data Analyst', 'Machine Learning Engineer' and 'Big Data Engineer', among others.\n\nAny comments,

Analysis\n\n<div id=\"Exp\"> \n\n</div>\n\n\nGiven the NLP nature of the datasets, similar exploration methods will be applied to each dataset to unveil their distinct characteristics. This will include using visualisations such as:\n\n1) Word Clouds\n\nWord clouds can identify trends and patterns that would otherwise be unclear or difficult to see in a tabular format. Frequently used keywords stand out better in a word cloud. Common words that might be overlooked in tabular form are highlighted in larger text making them pop out when displayed in a word cloud.\n\n2) N-Gram (Unigram, Bigram and Trigram)\n\nAn n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. Different definitions of n-grams will allow for the identification of the most prevalent words/sentences in the training data and thus help distinguish what comprises insincere and sincere questions.\n\nIt should be noted that prior to displaying individual words or sentences, the text will first be tokenized (based on a desired integer) and then put into a dataframe which will be used to construct side by side plots. Tokenization is, generally, an early step in the NLP process, a step which splits longer strings of text into smaller pieces, or tokens. Larger chunks of text can be tokenized into sentences, sentences can be tokenized into words, etc."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code for wordcloud (adapted for removal

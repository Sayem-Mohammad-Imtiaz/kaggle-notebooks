The lower back, which starts below the ribcage, is called the lumbar region. Pain here can be intense and is one of the top causes of missed work. Fortunately, low back pain often gets better on its own. When it doesn't, there are effective treatments.\n\n### Common symptoms experienced by people with low back pain\n* Low back pain is defined as pain and discomfort below the the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without referred leg pain. \n* It may be experienced as **aching, burning, stabbing, sharp or dull, well-defined, or vague with intensity ranging from mild to severe.**  \n* The pain may begin suddenly or develop gradually. Non-specific low back pain is defined as low back pain not attributed to recognisable, known **specific pathology (e.g. infection, tumour, osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, fracture, inflammatory process, radicular syndrome or cauda equina syndrome).** \n\n### Causes of Lower Back Pain\n\n![](https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/causes-backpain-info.jpg)\n\n### Low back pain subtypes\n* **Chronic back pain (CLBP)** is defined as low back pain persisting for longer than 7-12 weeks, or after the period of healing or recurring back pain that intermittently affects an individual over a long period of time.\n* **Acute back pain** is defined as low back pain lasting for less than 12 weeks.\n* **Subacute pain** is defined low back pain lasting between six weeks and three months.\n\n### Visual Information\n![](http://www.aspetar.com/journal/upload/images/2015111212013.png)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame,YouTubeVideo\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e43153aa6fefc3b42debc8ec875d033b14331807"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Lower Back Pain Explained"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"YouTubeVideo(\"zfs9oyA3pKg\",width=800, height=480)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6a9adea0aee7bdc5c96aff3de7e0ec890085645f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1 .

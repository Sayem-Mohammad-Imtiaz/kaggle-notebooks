{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nTo aid public health officials in the fight against coronavirus, Google and Apple started publishing anonymized mobility reports, showing how **movement trends** across different categories of places (residential, parks, retail, etc.) and modes of transport (driving, walking, public transport) have been varying since the beginning of the outbreak. \n\nIn this notebook I take a closer look at those two datasets - with a particular focus in European Union countries. I look for recent **changes in trends** and **whether the number of cases had a significant effect on public's mobility trends**. Given the inherently different nature of the two datasets, I investigate whether the correlation between the two is strong enough for them to be used interchangably. Finally, I then combine part of the dataset to create an **aggregate EU28 mobility index** that **serves a single point of reference for how mobility trends have been evolving in the European Union as a whole**.\n\n****Before we start, a disclaimer: **** Always **make sure you abide by the terms and conditions of the data you are using**. \n\nApple's [Terms of Use](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) state that \"You may use Mobility Trends Reports provided on the Site, including any updates thereto (collectively, the “Apple Data”), only for so long as reasonably necessary to coordinate a response to COVID-19 public health concerns (including the creation of public policy) while COVID-19 is defined as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation.\"\n\nThe goal of this notebook is to offer an alternative perspective and observations from looking at the data.

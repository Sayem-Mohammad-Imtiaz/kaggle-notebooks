The variation of each quantity gives us a different kind of glass.\n\n### Lets understand what those dimensions really mean.\n\n1.  RI - Refractive index, In optics, the refractive index or index of refraction of a material is a dimensionless number that describes how light propagates through that medium. **This is an important factor that differentiates any glass type**.\n\n2. Na - Sodium\n\n3. Mg - Magnesium\nMagnesium and iron increase glass alteration, forming tri-octahedral smectites with the same (Fe + Mg)/Si ratio. With iron, two kinds of silicates precipitate with the same composition but with a different morphology, whereas with magnesium alone, a single Mg-silicate forms. Moreover, it was found that the glass alteration rate drops when the pH stabilizes at a minimum value of 7.8 for Mg-silicates and 6.2 for Fe-silicates. At this point the secondary silicates stop precipitating. This result was confirmed by geochemical simulation and the solubility product of these silicates was estimated considering the presence or absence of aluminum in their structure.\nSource: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088329271630539X\n\n4. Al - Aluminium, Gives strength to the glass. Higher Al makes stronger glasses. \nSource: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/04/alumina_in_glass_could_make_busted_smartphones_a_thing_of_the_past/\n\n5. Si - Silica is the primary ingredient in the production of most glass. So it wont be a surprise if we find Si having a major share in glass making.\n\n6. K - Potassium - For stronger glass. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemically_strengthened_glass\n\n7. Ca - Calcium - Soda–lime glass, also called soda–lime–silica glass, is the most prevalent type of glass, used for windowpanes and glass containers (bottles and jars) for beverages, food, and some commodity items. Glass bakeware is often made of borosilicate glass. Soda–lime glass accounts for about 90% of manufactured glass.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda%E2%80%93lime_glass\n\n8. Ba - Barium, is what is used in television screens to protects our eyes from the harmful X-Rays that could cause long term health issues.\n\n9. Fe - Iron as mentioned with Magnesium is used for glass alteration.\n\nNow that we have an understanding of our dimensions, lets find the correlations between the dimensions.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0c4fe0919f49714415af07775fdd8447a36546ee"},"cell_type":"code","source":"corrmat = features.corr()\ncorrmat","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cb79840e1cfb72a6afbc3eb64a827de90abbe5c5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"corrmat.iloc[0,:].plot(kind='bar')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"56ec8ffcc0c8718a039889c5b919906ffa8e3e12"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see in the plot above, the Refractive index of a glass is positively affected when there is an increase in Calcium and Iron content while for the rest of the elements the refractive index has a negative correlation.\n\n## Lets also see how other elements are correlated with each other."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0eb07fe19dfccc8e63e76ec54047812fce2d3af3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nchartlocation = 0\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,12))\ncolumns = np.copy(corrmat.columns.values)\nfor index, row in corrmat.iterrows():\n    column_name = columns[chartlocation]\n    chartlocation = chartlocation + 1\n    plt.subplot(3,3,chartlocation)\n    row.drop(index).plot(kind='bar', title=column_name)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"16599b6fe8a6c254fd1a791f76f6283926b754ca"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that Silica is the only element which is negatively correlated with every other element that make up the glass.

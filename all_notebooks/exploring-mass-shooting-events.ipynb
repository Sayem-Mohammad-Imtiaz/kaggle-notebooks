We will probe the basic dataset attributes and hopefully uncover some interesting effects from the data!

What significant differences are there between the US and Indian homesharing networks (besides the presence of hotels), and can you quantify them?\nCan you mine the textual description fields, omitted here, to see what kinds of words most commonly appear in listing descriptions?

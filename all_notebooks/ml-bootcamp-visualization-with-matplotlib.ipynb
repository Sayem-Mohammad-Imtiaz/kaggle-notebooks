If you don't already know NumPy and pandas, you should still be able to follow this notebook and understand the basic ideas, though I still highly recommend that you read and experiment with the previous notebooks\n\nIn this notebook, I will take the reader through [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which is the most famous package for visualization in Python. Machine learning deals with a huge amount of data and without proper insignt into the data, it is hard to come up with something useful. `matplotlib` supports a variety of [plot types](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) which can be exteremely useful within machine learning and outside it.\n\nFor good visualization we need good data.

This method instrurcts matplotlib that the upcoming plot-related instructions belong to particular subplot of the figure. The method accepts three parameters, one for the number of subplot rows in the figure, one for the number of subplot columns, and the last is for the index of the subplot currently being created starting from the top-left corner with index 1 and moving right. For example, the following call:\n```Python\nplt.subplot(3, 3, 4)\n```\ninstruct matplotlib that our figure should have 3 rows and 3 columns of subplots, and that we are currently created the plot number of 4.\n\nAs a demonstration, let's modify our code at the beginning for plotting the sine function to draw multiple plots of the sine function, each having different frequency:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x1 = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 200)\ny1 = np.sin(x1)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\nfor i in range(1, 10):\n    plt.subplot(3, 3, i)\n    #plt.plot(x1, y1)\n    plt.plot(x1, np.sin(i*x1))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Summary\n\nI hope this gave you a taste of how to work with matplotlib. The number of different [kinds](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) of graphs you can do with matplotlib is huge, so this notebook is no way a representation of the power of matplotlib. Instead, I hope I managed to take you through the basics of matplotlib that, with a little googling or Stack Overflow reading, you could easily generate the plot type you need to visualize your data.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that I focused on 2D plots here. It is frequently necessary to deal with 3D plots. However, the notebook is already long, so I thought I would refer you to [matplotlib 3D plotting tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/tutorial.html) if you need such plots.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that matplotlib is not the only visualization library in Python. In fact, there are [many more](https://www.anaconda.com/python-data-visualization-2018-why-so-many-libraries/) libraries and matplotlib is just one of them, though it is one of the oldest and most popular library and many other libraries build on top of it. One interesting library which extends matplotlib is [seaborn](seaborn.pydata.org) as mentioned in the section about heat maps. Another interesting library I came to know about recently is [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html).\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Generally, a linear model is appropriate and has the advantage of being fast to train. One of the numerous things I've learned while taking [fastai's](http://course.fast.ai/) MOOC's is that a Naive Bayes linear classifier is a really solid baseline for NLP problems. Let's take a look and see how it works.\n\nNaive Bayes uses Bayes theorem to calculate the conditional probability of a rating given some text. Of course, this is quite vague. Say my review is \"This restaurant is terrible\". I could take that 4 word sentence and see how often it appears in 1 star reviews and then see how often it appears in 5 star reviews. With those counts you could calculate a probability ratio telling you what type of review that text appears in more frequently.\n\nBut I'm sure you've noticed a problem. How many reviews have that *exact* text 'This restaurant is terrible'? We'd never get satisfying results because reviews would all have unique text. A simple way around this is to remove all the structure of the sentences and just use a bag of words representation of review text. \"This restaurant is terrible\" becomes a vector with counts of \"This\", \"restaurant\", \"is\", \"terrible\". For this baseline model I am just using unigrams, but bi/trigrams could easily be used as well (and could results in a modest accuracy bump). \n\nAs one final preprocessing step, I'm actually going to use tfidf(term frequency, inverse-document frequency) rather than simple word counts to represent the word vectors. Essentially, this weights the words to show how important a word is to a particular review--so frequently used words, such as 'the', have a lower weight since they appear so often in almost every review.\n\nThis tokenizing and tfidf calcuation is all done with sklearn's TfidfVectorizer method."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c681b68b-cf22-41b3-b3ef-53fdcce6d688","_uuid":"8b628087f78afb02b25c4c02006f7b9baf72b0cb","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# max_features is an upper bound on the number of words in the vocabulary\nmax_features = 2000\ntfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features = max_features)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8cfd3fcf-3c3b-4aee-a58e-c518b270b992","_uuid":"13988eb4f00c8602d352933f5febb1faa8289fbd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With the text in a usable form, I can now apply Bayes theorem. We want to answer the questions: given the review \"This restaurant is terrible\", what is the probability this is a 1 star review and what is the probability this is a 5 star review(this all works the same for 1-5 star reviews, it's just easier to illustrate with a binary classification). Well, another way of asking this question is: what is the probability of a one star review given the words \"This\", \"restaurant\", \"is\", \"terrible\"? If we assume each word is independent of the other (a very naive assumption--but where naive bayes gets it's name), then we can calculate this by:\n$$\\textit{P(this|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(restaurant|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(is|1 star)} \\times \\textit{P(terrible|1 star)}$$\n\nOne wrinkle is what do we do for words that we haven't seen in a review category. Do we pretend 'amazing' is never seen in a 1 star review just because we haven't seen it yet? This would cause a lot of issues, so we get around it by adding 1 to all word counts. This basically says--yeah, we haven't seen that word yet, but we acknowledge it's possible it might occur.\n\nAfter all this, you can calculate the probability of a 'This restaurant is terrible' given a 1 star review and given a 5 star review. Once calculated, we just predicted the rating of whichever probability is highest--or we can divide them and predict 1 star if positive and 5 stars if negative. \n\nThese predictions would be the result for a simple naive bayes model, but here I am actually going to use these\nnaive bayes calculations (or features) in a logistic regression model. I will take my naive bayes probability calculations and multiply them by my original feature matrix and then learn the parameters with a logistic regression model. For a better explanation than I can give, take a look at Jeremy Howard's explanation [here](https://youtu.be/37sFIak42Sc?t=3745)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b7e29314-875e-4c3b-bfd2-b3c487c958f9","_uuid":"7509de3497fdc97cf60b0482acf092b0a0319c34"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I created a NBFeatures class to implement all the Naive Bayes logic."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"706f0e42-e176-4d92-ac67-83dd32adcdfc","_uuid":"96f5788adc3418ba4993c6f8e6f3ff570e9e51a2","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class NBFeatures(BaseEstimator):\n    '''Class implementation of Jeremy Howards NB Linear model'''\n    def __init__(self, alpha):\n        # Smoothing Parameter: always going to be one for my use\n        self.alpha = alpha\n        \n    def preprocess_x(self, x, r):\n        return x.multiply(r)\n    \n    # calculate probabilities\n    def pr(self, x, y_i, y):\n        p = x[y == y_i].sum(0)\n        return (p + self.alpha)/((y==y_i).sum()+self.alpha)\n    \n    # calculate the log ratio and represent as sparse matrix\n    # ie fit the nb model\n    def fit(self, x, y = None):\n        self._r = sparse.csr_matrix(np.log(self.pr(x, 1, y) /self.pr(x, 0, y)))\n        return self\n    \n    # apply the nb fit to original features x\n    def transform(self, x):\n        x_nb = self.preprocess_x(x, self._r)\n        return x_nb","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2a3d42d8-db0b-4e07-bfc8-2c8af709c4af","_uuid":"a7c6b7daa9f441b908f3ba5a0ccc0f1f1b533fd1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And then I take advantage of sklearn Pipeline to cleanly combine several steps.

As an example, you could see 'it' appear contextually as 'it was', 'it wasn't', 'it became', and 'it sat' just to name a few. Since it *doesn't* appear in thousands of other contexts, what we'd end up getting is a long vector  of \\[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...] where there is a 0 in contexts where that word wasn't seen and a count with the number of times that word appeared in the other spots. \n\nIt turns out that you can represent most of this information (or vector space) with far fewer dimensions so word vectors use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduces the number of dimensions down to, say, 25-300. For a more detailed overview of the basic idea, this [gist](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469) is a good code focused walk through.\n\nThis might not, initially, seem all that useful, but what these word vectors do is tell us the relationship between words. Since they are vectors, we can perform arithmetic with them. The canonical example goes something like this: what do you get if you take ***queen*** and subtract ***woman***? A ***king***. Or what about if you add ***frozen*** to ***water***? You get ***ice***!  There is something really cool about this to me and I'd encourage you to explore the concept yourself to learn more.\n\nThe bad news is that training your own word vectors requires an enormous amount of text data. Luckily, there are several very good precomputed vectors(or embeddings) which are freely distributed and available for modeling. Here I'll be using [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) embeddings taken from the twitter corpus. There are GloVe embeddings from other sources, such as Wikipedia or the common crawl, as well as other embeddings like FastText. Since I know from exploration that reviews often contain non-standard english and unusual punctuation/language I thought twitter seemed fitting. It performed the best out of the embeddings I tried, but depending on your data set another embedding may perform better. If you want to get really fancy you can combine embeddings--that seems to be very common and very powerful if Kaggle competitions are any indication.\n\nMy twitter embeddings are 200 dimensional, so I need to set my embedding size equal to that number of dimensions. This will be used to build my embedding matrix."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e975ee97-f6f3-47e7-adf1-776fb9f06dc4","_uuid":"148a8a4b6debf64395d9e9180f0a1f56695c3ac8","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I'm using GLoVe word vectors to get pretrained word embeddings\nembed_size = 200 \n# max number of unique words \nmax_features = 20000\n# max number of words from review to use\nmaxlen = 200\n\n# File path\nembedding_file = '../input/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation/glove.twitter.27B.200d.txt'\n\n# read in embeddings\ndef get_coefs(word,*arr): return word, np.asarray(arr, dtype='float32')\nembeddings_index = dict(get_coefs(*o.strip().split()) for o in open(embedding_file))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0455761e-643d-4a42-b34a-4c9c0876d0fa","_uuid":"5a900943d83857380a81dc72dc21ef9d92c17b59","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"class_names = ['stars_1', 'stars_2', 'stars_3', 'stars_4', 'stars_5']\n# Splitting off my y variable\ny = train_samp[class_names].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a39419f3-4b2c-4f8d-91c4-765a8abaf308","_uuid":"d03dc816bf707b30843789138a7c622d3968663c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now I need to tokenize my data.

In this case, I tried combinations of LSTM(long short-term memory) layers, GRU(gated recurrent units) layers, adding multiple dense layers, stacking multiple GRU or LSTM layers, bidirectional vs standard layers, etc and all had pretty similar levels of performance. I ended up going with an architecture that was successfully applied in the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52644). I used that structure as my baseline and nothing I tried beat it by much. I did have a double GRU followed by a huge dense layer structure that performed marginally better, but took quite a bit longer to train so I abandoned it.\n\nI won't go into much detail about LSTM vs GRU because, frankly, I'm not an expert and I learned most of what I know from several [*excellent*](http://www.wildml.com/2015/10/recurrent-neural-network-tutorial-part-4-implementing-a-grulstm-rnn-with-python-and-theano/) [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gru-networks-2ef37df6c9be) [posts](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). \n\nJust a couple implementation notes: I set trainable to true even though I am using pretrained embeddings. This resulted in a higher accuracy. This is probably related to fine tuning the vectors and training vectors for the numerous words that didn't appear in the glove twitter embeddings. I also set up earlystop and checkpoint callbacks. Early stop will automatically stop training the model after your desired metric is no longer improving. This was really handy because I could just set the number of epochs to a relatively high number and let keras automatically stop when overfitting is likely occurring.

I could encode seemingly important text features--such as overuse of capital letters. I could even get really ambitious and normalize text by fixing things like spelling errors. I think is probably the single largest area for improvement.\n\n* ***Train/Test-time augmentation(TTA)*** This is something I heard about on Kaggle and really wanted to try, but I didn't have time. The basic idea is to use machine translation to translate the reviews to, say, French and then back to English. This will alter the text of the review effectively giving you more data. This should be useful in reducing overfitting and allowing you to train a better model. Additionally, the machine translation will often take care of simple text correction which is helpful for accuracy. This technique was applied very successfully in some recent Kaggle classification competitions.\n\n* ***Ensembling models together*** It's a huge simplification, but the best model is often a combination of several models.  A starting point would be combining the Naive Bayes and LSTM/GRU models through simple averaging. You can expand this a huge amount, but I'd have to set up a very rigorous cross validation scheme to avoid massively overfitting.\n\n* ***Using newer architectures*** Recently, capsule networks and special types of convolutional neural networks--typical used on image classification--have been shown to be highly effective in NLP problems. These models are high performing on their own, but since they are significantly different architectures from the RNN's I've used above, they are also promising candidates for ensembling.\n\nBut, again, this isn't about building the best possible model.

The records are labeled with the class variable \"NObesity\" (Obesity Level) that allows classification in 7 groups: \"Insufficient Weight\", \"Normal Weight\", \"Overweight Level I\", \"Overweight Level II\", \"Obesity Type I\", \"Obesity Type II\" and \"Obesity Type III\". The dataset authors note that 23% of the records were collected directly from users through a web platform, and the remaining 77% were generated synthetically with Weka tool and SMOTE filter.\n\nEating habits, physical activity, and genes are factors which affect person's obesity predisposition. The task here is to explore the dataset, and to find a decent model that would be capable to tell if someone is overweight or obese, or his or her body fits into the normal (health) range. On the other hand, an attempt was made to cluster the data based on all features (predictors). Both - classification and clustering - tasks are described after data exploration.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"id":"WdYaPIJAydlT","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T08:54:05.718411Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T08:54:05.719074Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T08:54:05.731884Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T08:54:05.718934Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T08:54:05.731082Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree\nfrom sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, f1_score, accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, roc_auc_score\n\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans","metadata":{"id":"2n4RHwESydlV","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T08:54:09.417727Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T08:54:09.418232Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T08:54:10.762702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T08:54:09.418201Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T08:54:10.761728Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install scikit-plot","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T08:54:15.091117Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T08:54:15.091513Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.495021Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T08:54:15.09148Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.493816Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import scikitplot as skplt","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.497175Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.497621Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.516253Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.497573Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-18T08:54:23.515456Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## I.

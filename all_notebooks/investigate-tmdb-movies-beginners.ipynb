(2) kind of properties that are associated with movies with a high vote of at least 7.0 from 10? After the above analysis, I can conclude the following:\n<br/><br/>\n>** Properties and attributes of the movies have a profit of at least 100 Million Dollars: **\n- Average popularity of the movie 1.3112 million people.\n- Average Budget must be around 42 Million Dollars\n- Average revenue must be around 257 Million Dollars\n- Year that makes the most profit: 2013.\n- Month to release the movie: December or June\n- Actors to cast: Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Samuel L. Jackson.\n- Any one of these should be the director: Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, Ron Howard.\n- Popular production companies for high profit movies: Universal Pictures, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures.\n- Genre must any of these: Drama, Comedy, Thriller.\n\n\n>** For a movie to have a vote of at least 7.0 : **\n- Average popularity of the movie 1.088 million people.\n- Average Budget must be around 38 Million Dollars.\n- Average revenue must be around 161 Million Dollars.\n- Actors to cast: Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt.\n- Any one of these should be the director:  Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Joel Coen.\n- Produce by any of these production companies: Warner Bros., Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures .\n- Genre must any of these: Comedy, Drama, Documentary.\n\n<br/><br/>\n>By meeting the above criteria, the movie will have a higher probability to be a hit and earn an average revenue of around 371 million dollar and profit of at least 100 million dollars.\n<br/><br/>\nBut do note that the above analysis was done on the movies from 1960 to 2015 and with a profit of at least 100 million dollar.

For many problems, it makes sense to remove punctuation. On the other hand, in this case, we are tackling a sentiment analysis problem, and it is possible that \"!!!\" or \":-(\" could carry sentiment, and should be treated as words.

For example, we could treat them as words, or replace them all with a placeholder string such as \"NUM\".\n\nTo remove punctuation and numbers, we will use a package for dealing with regular expressions, called re.

One common approach is called a Bag of Words. The Bag of Words model learns a vocabulary from all of the documents, then models each document by counting the number of times each word appears. For example, consider the following two sentences:\n\nSentence 1: \"The cat sat on the hat\"\n\nSentence 2: \"The dog ate the cat and the hat\"\n\nFrom these two sentences, our vocabulary is as follows:\n\n{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n\nTo get our bags of words, we count the number of times each word occurs in each sentence. In Sentence 1, \"the\" appears twice, and \"cat\", \"sat\", \"on\", and \"hat\" each appear once, so the feature vector for Sentence 1 is:\n\n{ the, cat, sat, on, hat, dog, ate, and }\n\nSentence 1: { 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 }\n\nSimilarly, the features for Sentence 2 are: { 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n\nIn the IMDB data, we have a very large number of reviews, which will give us a large vocabulary. To limit the size of the feature vectors, we should choose some maximum vocabulary size. Below, we use the 5000 most frequent words (remembering that stop words have already been removed).\n\nWe'll be using the feature_extraction module from scikit-learn to create bag-of-words features.

The Random Forest algorithm is included in scikit-learn (Random Forest uses many tree-based classifiers to make predictions, hence the \"forest\"). Below, we set the number of trees to 100 as a reasonable default value. More trees may (or may not) perform better, but will certainly take longer to run. Likewise, the more features you include for each review, the longer this will take."},{"metadata":{"_execution_state":"busy","_uuid":"1efc0479f9a05a6ef34f1c189284bb1d9f1b4772","trusted":true,"_cell_guid":"91ef58d5-2da9-4ac2-c6a9-fff2fa01058f","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print( \"Training the random forest...\")\n#from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n\n# Initialize a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees\nforest = GaussianNB()\n\n\n# Fit the forest to the training set, using the bag of words as \n# features and the sentiment labels as the response variable\n#\n# This may take a few minutes to run\nforest = forest.fit( train_data_features, train[\"sentiment\"] )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f844a2c3737f1e5674f95ae3b5e64404a8dc80f5","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the test data\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"../input/testData.tsv\", header=0, delimiter=\"\\t\", \\\n                   quoting=3 )\n\n# Verify that there are 25,000 rows and 2 columns\nprint(test.shape)\n\n# Create an empty list and append the clean reviews one by one\nnum_reviews = len(test[\"review\"])\nclean_test_reviews = [] \n\nprint(\"Cleaning and parsing the test set movie reviews...\\n\")\nfor i in range(0,num_reviews):\n    #if( (i+1) % 1000 == 0 ):\n    #    print (\"Review %d of %d\\n\" % (i+1, num_reviews))\n    clean_review = review_to_words( test[\"review\"][i] )\n    clean_test_reviews.append( clean_review )\n\n# Get a bag of words for the test set, and convert to a numpy array\ntest_data_features = vectorizer.transform(clean_test_reviews)\ntest_data_features = test_data_features.toarray()\n\n# Use the random forest to make sentiment label predictions\nresult = forest.predict(test_data_features)\n\n# Copy the results to a pandas dataframe with an \"id\" column and\n# a \"sentiment\" column\noutput = pd.DataFrame( data={\"id\":test[\"id\"], \"sentiment\":result} )\n\n# Use pandas to write the comma-separated output file\noutput.to_csv( \"NB_model.csv\", index=False, quoting=3 )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b081d0d23dadc81a574738b1523f2f83308df12c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

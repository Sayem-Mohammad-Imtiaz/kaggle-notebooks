Inventory of above 30 units of Product variation shows a sales boost. And total inventory should be above 50 for safer sales.\n    7. Bulk of shipping is done by one company. More than 90% sales don't prefer an express shipping. Preferred shipping price is in range of 4.Shipping to 20-60 countires seems safe for a good sales.\n    8. No urgency banner, lower the sales.

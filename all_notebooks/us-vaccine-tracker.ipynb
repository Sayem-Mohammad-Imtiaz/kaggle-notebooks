{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nIt can be a troubling time, but we do have hope on the horizon, with the news we get daily about vaccines. Multiple companies are releasing and getting their vaccines approved; we may  soon see a path forward. \n\nUsing the robust toolset provided by Kaggle, I'll show you how to create an interactive map to track, for each state, the percentage of inhabitants that have been vaccinated against COVID-19.  \n\nTo get started, if you haven't already, make your own copy of this notebook by clicking on the **[Copy and Edit]** button in the top right corner. \n\nThis notebook is an example of a project that you can create based on what you'd learn from taking Kaggle's [Geospatial Analysis course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis).\n\n# US Vaccine Tracker\n\nWe'll use two datasets.  \n\n- The first dataset has the total number of inhabitants of each state, along with latitude and longitude data for each state's capital city.  This dataset is pulled from the 2019 US Census, and I've uploaded it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/peretzcohen/2019-census-us-population-data-by-state).\n- The second dataset contains a recent estimate for the total number of people that have been vaccinated in each state.  This [vaccine dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv) is drawn from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), who update their vaccine datasets from the CDC quite regularly.  Every time you run this notebook, you'll use the most recent version of their data.\n\nIn the next code cell, we load and preprocess the data.  As output, you'll see the total percent of the population that has been vaccinated in the US, along with a preview of the Pandas DataFrame that we'll use to make the tracker."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import date, timedelta\nimport folium\nfrom folium import Choropleth, Marker\nfrom folium.plugins import MarkerCluster\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom folium import GeoJson \n\n# Population Data\npopulationData = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/2019-census-us-population-data-by-state/2019_Census_US_Population_Data_By_State_Lat_Long.csv')\n\n# Get the most recent date for filtering\nfreshDate = date.today() - timedelta(days=1)\nfreshDate = date.strftime(freshDate,\"%Y%m%d\")\nfreshDate = freshDate[0:4] + \"-\" + freshDate[4:6] + \"-\" + freshDate[6:8]\n\n# Vaccination data, for most recent date\nvaccinationData = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/us_state_vaccinations.csv')\nvaccinationByLocation = vaccinationData.loc[(vaccinationData.date == freshDate)][[\"location\", \"people_vaccinated\"]]\n\n# Vaccination and population data\nvaccinationAndPopulationByLocation = pd.merge(populationData, vaccinationByLocation, left_on='STATE',right_on='location').drop(columns=\"location\")\n\n# Calculate percentage vaccinated by state\nvaccinationAndPopulationByLocation[\"percent_vaccinated\"] = vaccinationAndPopulationByLocation[\"people_vaccinated\"] / vaccinationAndPopulationByLocation[\"POPESTIMATE2019\"]\n\nvaccinationAndPopulationByLocation.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate the total percent vaccinated in the US\npercentageTotal = vaccinationAndPopulationByLocation[\"people_vaccinated\"].sum() / vaccinationAndPopulationByLocation[\"POPESTIMATE2019\"].sum()\nprint('Percentage Vaccinated in the US: {}%'.format(round(percentageTotal*100, 2))) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The next code cell uses the data to create a tracker, with one marker for each state.

Collection of five, eight or more cards in a cards game are normally called poker hands. There are various poker variations, each with different poker hands ranking.

The proposed model succeeded in classification of poker hands with 78.84% classification accuracy.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"OBJECTIVE OF THE WORK\nThe aim of this project is to build a classifier that uses the CART decision tree algorithm to classify the strength of a given poker hand.\nDATA SET\nLink: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand\nEach record is an example of a hand consisting of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck of 52. Each card is described using two attributes (suit and rank), for a total of 10 predictive attributes. There is one Class attribute that describes the \"Poker Hand\". The order of cards is important, which is why there are 480 possible Royal Flush hands as compared to 4 (one for each suit).\n\nAttribute Information:\n1)\tS1 \"Suit of card #1\" Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}\n\n2)\tC1 \"Rank of card #1\" Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)\n\n3)\tS2 \"Suit of card #2\" Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}\n\n4)\tC2 \"Rank of card #2\" Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)\n\n5)\tS3 \"Suit of card #3\" Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}\n\n6)\tC3 \"Rank of card #3\" Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)\n\n7)\tS4 \"Suit of card #4\" Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}\n\n8)\tC4 \"Rank of card #4\" Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)\n\n9)\tS5 \"Suit of card #5\" Ordinal (1-4) representing {Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs}\n\n10)\tC5 \"Rank of card 5\" Numerical (1-13) representing (Ace, 2, 3, ... , Queen, King)\n\n11)\tCLASS \"Poker Hand\" Ordinal (0-9)\n\n0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand \n\n1:\tOne pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards\n\n2:\tTwo pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards\n\n3:\tThree of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards\n\n4:\tStraight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps\n\n5:\tFlush; five cards with the same suit\n\n6:\tFull house; pair + different rank three of a kind\n\n7:\tFour of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards\n\n8:\tStraight flush; straight + flush\n\n9:\tRoyal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush\n\nPREPROCESSING\nData Pre-processing:\nThe Data does not contain any missing values hence the only pre-processing that was required was to normalize the data while reading. Normalization is the process of defining the data type of each of the column so that they are not read in the incorrect format.All columns hold integer values hence at the time of reading the file.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"PROCESSING TECNIQUES\nDecision trees are one of the most powerful and commonly used supervised learning algorithms in the field of data mining. It is important that a decision tree performs accurately when employed on unseen data; therefore, evaluation methods are used to measure the predictive performance of a decision tree classifier. However, the predictive accuracy of a decision tree is also dependent on the evaluation method chosen since training and testing sets of decision tree models are selected according to the evaluation methods. At the time a model is built for a decision tree, the first question that comes into mind is how accurate or reliable the model is on unseen cases. This is the reason why evaluation of decision trees is essential because one should be certain that the resulting decision tree will be reliable and efficient. In some cases, there might be more than one decision tree model for a specific machine learning problem and one of them must be preferred over the others. In such cases, the only option to overcome such a problem is to take some precautionary steps.\nAccuracy Estimating Methodologies Previously, metrics and measurements that are required in accuracy estimating methodologies in order to build a clear connection between the two concepts. As mentioned earlier, accuracy is the most suitable measure for performance evaluation of decision trees. Consequently, all the estimating methodologies that are going to be discussed are based on accuracy metrics, hit rates, error rates and so on. Estimating accuracy is important for several reasons. Firstly, it is needed to verify if a model is reliable for future predictions. Secondly, when there is more than one model, there needs to be a metric that can separate the best among multiple and this is where an accuracy estimation method comes in.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Please run this code using Jupyter Notebooks(Anaconda Navigator) and also run the file counter.py(check the datasets).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"LAu1NWEhWNZs","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from __future__ import print_function\nimport pandas as pd\ndata_train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokerdatatraincsv/train.csv\")\ndata_test = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokerdatatestcsv/test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"N53NP7o-WNZv","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"header = ['S1', 'C1', 'S2', 'C2', 'S3', 'C3','S4', 'C4', 'S5', 'C5', 'CLASS']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"zAn8W9lFWNZx","outputId":"87e159bc-4cd1-4afb-e3af-e693cbdd3b5a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_train.head()\ndata_test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"4ZPJuskaWNZ2","outputId":"6dd7803d-e43b-44da-e132-3d79225fc8b9","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_train.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"IXujQhfBWNZ5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_train = data_train.to_numpy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"O2scDDzRWNZ8","outputId":"ecdde3c2-07c0-43ca-d9dc-acd6f57e5b58","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"yLADG7HrWNZ_","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_test = data_test.to_numpy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"RH9uhJWtWNaC","outputId":"d55ad80c-5c87-4717-8581-76927b0bb4fd","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"q6OCIRhtWNaG"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Building Decision Tree","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"VPMdhr9eWNaH","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def unique_vals(rows, col):\n    \"\"\"Find the unique values for a column in a dataset.\"\"\"\n    return set([row[col] for row in rows])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"C2V3t1SaWNaK","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def class_counts(rows):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of each type of example in a dataset.\"\"\"\n    counts = {}  # a dictionary of label -> count.\n    for row in rows:\n        # in our dataset format, the label is always the last column\n        label = row[-1]\n        if label not in counts:\n            counts[label] = 0\n        counts[label] += 1\n    return counts","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"CK4CIX9UWNaN","outputId":"077a09a2-7e60-471e-a2e8-506be949f41f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print (class_counts(data_train))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Wx8oASWnWNaQ","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def is_numeric(value):\n    \"\"\"Test if a value is numeric.\"\"\"\n    return isinstance(value, int) or isinstance(value, float)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"wCHllEWnWNaS","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class Question:\n    \"\"\"A Question is used to partition a dataset.\n\n    This class just records a 'column number' (e.g., 0 for Color) and a\n    'column value' (e.g., Green).

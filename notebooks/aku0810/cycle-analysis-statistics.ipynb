Trip duration follows a definite seasonal pattern that\nrepeats over time. Forecasting this time series can help me to predict the times when\nthe company needs to push its marketing efforts and times when most trips anticipated\ncan help ensure operational efficiencies. As for the promotions, \nthe best station at which to kick off the campaign would be Pier 69/Alaskan Way & Clay\nSt. Outliers were a tiny portion of the dataset; however, their time series nature meant\nthat those outliers couldn’t be removed and transformation was thus applied.

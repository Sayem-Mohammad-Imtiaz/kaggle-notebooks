This tool has been around for quite a while and its not going anywhere anytime soon; because it is fast, reliable, elegant and easy to read even for non-programmers. Therefore, I am forcing myself out of my comfort (pandas) zone and tryng to better undestand the SQLite by fully engaging with it. In this short tutorial, I will ask and answer questions about the bicycle sharing dataset by writing queries and comments. If you are someone who is good with SQL, please comment on my queries with your advice(s) on improving it. Hope you will find it worthy of your time!

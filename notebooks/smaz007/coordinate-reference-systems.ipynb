But, as you know, the world is actually a three-dimensional globe. So we have to use a method called a **map projection** to render it as a flat surface.  \n\nMap projections can't be 100% accurate.  Each projection distorts the surface of the Earth in some way, while retaining some useful property.  For instance,\n- the *equal-area* projections (like \"Lambert Cylindrical Equal Area\", or \"Africa Albers Equal Area Conic\") preserve area.  This is a good choice, if you'd like to calculate the area of a country or city, for example.\n- the *equidistant* projections (like \"Azimuthal Equidistant projection\") preserve distance.  This would be a good choice for calculating flight distance.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/noBRRNR.png\" width=\"700\">\n<b>List of map projections</b> (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2kOHTBs\">Source</a>)<br/><br/>\n</center>\n\nWe use a **coordinate reference system (CRS)** to show how the projected points correspond to real locations on Earth.  In this tutorial, you'll learn more about coordinate reference systems, along with how to use them in GeoPandas.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\nTo create your own copy of this notebook (where you can run the code yourself!), <b><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/5832126\">click here</a></b>.  \n</div>"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setting the CRS\n\nWhen we create a GeoDataFrame from a shapefile, the CRS is already imported for us.

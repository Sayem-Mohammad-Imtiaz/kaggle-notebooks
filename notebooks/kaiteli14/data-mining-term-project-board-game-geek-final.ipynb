First and foremost, since preproecessing is a huge and necessary part of data mining, this post show step by step on how the preprocessing is done. Also at the end the preprocessing, a breif summary will be provided for the readers to remind what we have accomplished up on till that point. Secondly, a quick data analysis will be provided to see how the data look like after all the preprocessing work, this part gathers good intelligence of the data which we will be working with for the rest of the post. Thirdly, the prediction of the rating based on text comments is awefully similar to our third assignment which we are predicting movie reviews based on text reviews; however, the difference is that the ratings of the board games are continuous numbers from 0 to 10. I am planning on discretizing these ratings so that there are only 11 class labels (0 through 10). After that, I will use sklearn's Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers to experiment with the data set and gather all the accuracies. My contribution would be implementing ensemble voting, analyze my mechanism, introducing different measurements. Fourthly, I will finalize a ensemble classfier to predict input reviews from outside. Lastly, readers should also read \"Important Note\" which reveals critical information throughout the post if reader wants to try running the notebook himself."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Links\n## 1.

Since I have preprocessed my data into discrete format (0-10), we can think about the prediction as classification of the data into 11 classes intead of just 2. What I want to achieve and contribute after this section is to use ensemble method to improve accuracy which I learned from this course. I think it is good to try applying in class theory into practice. Furthermore, the entire data has been partitioned into 3 sectors of 33% each for the classifiers. The reason the proportion is decided this way is because this porportion will have accuracy around 31.5% which is very close to the accuracy of 32.6% when we use the entire 2.7 million rows of data.

From brainstorming ideas on how to do this project, incrementally refining the data, trying out different methods before deciding on implementing ensemble voting mechanism to better the sklearn Naive Bayes classifier to finally writing everything and also making sure I give the extra mile of effort by implementing extra credit portion of the requirement which is Flask Web App deployment with my own class of ensemble voting classifer to make the prediction live. I have learned a tremendous amount of knowledge through this project and I truely feel that I am very comfortable with Kaggle/Jupyter Notebook. Aside from the time consuming aspect of this endeavor, I find deployment portion very hard and I will talk a little about how I overcame the difficulty. First of all, the data set is 1 GB and the upper limit of AnywherePython is only 100MB, therefore, there is no way we can preporcess and cut the size down to that amount. Even if we can, doing the training on each run of the Webapp would be utterly pointless. I then thought about the Python pickle module which I can use to serialize my EnsembleVoting classfier object after training and clearing all the data reference. After that, I spent hours on understanding how Flask works with Python and HTML. Then, I finished my Flask APP writing; however, when I was about to deployed it, there was an extremely subtle difference between serializing using Juypter Notebook and serializing using just Python file which makes the former not work with the deployment. To debug this portion, I spent almost 10 hours to do my research and I finally find that serilization only works if my class is defined in another file, otherwise, \"__main__\" prefix will be attached to my serialized byte code when I process the storage with the \"pickle\". Finally, I am able to overcome all these chanllenge and finish this term project.

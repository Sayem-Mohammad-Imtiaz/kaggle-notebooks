Next to the HAM-D17, the MADRS is the most commonly used outcome measure in antidepressant efficacy trials and has been used with increasing frequency during the past decade.

While the HAM-D17 includes items that address somatic symptoms, the MADRS focuses on the psychological symptoms of depression (e.g., sadness, tension, and pessimistic thoughts). This scale is clinician-rated and consists of 10 items; each item is rated on a 0-6 scale, resulting in a maximum total score of 60 points, with higher scores indicative of greater depressive symptomology. The MADRS scoring instructions indicate that a total score ranging from 0 to 6 indicates that the patient is in the normal range (no depression), a score ranging from 7 to 19 indicates “mild depression,” 20 to 34 indicates “moderate depression,” a score of 35 and greater indicates “severe depression,” and a total score of 60 or greater indicates “very severe depression.” There is evidence that an improvement of two points or more on the MADRS is considered clinically relevant."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First of all let's check how efficient of treatment for every patient"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8), dpi =100)\n\nplt.plot(scores['id'][:23], scores['madrs1'][:23])\n\nplt.plot(scores['id'][:23], scores['madrs2'][:23])\n\nplt.xticks(range(24))\n\nplt.title('MADRS scores before and after treatment')\n\nplt.xlabel('patient id')\nplt.ylabel('MADRS score')\n\nplt.grid()\n\nplt.legend(['Before', 'After'])\n\nplt.show()\n\nplt.close()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8), dpi =100)\n\nplt.plot(scores['id'][:24], scores['madrs1'][:24])\n\nplt.plot(scores['id'][:24], scores['madrs2'][:24])\nplt.fill_between(range(len(scores['id'][:24])), scores['madrs1'][:24], scores['madrs2'][:24], where = (scores['madrs1'][:24] <=  scores['madrs2'][:24]), interpolate=True, alpha=0.3, color='red')\n\nplt.xticks(range(24))\n\nplt.title('MADRS scores before and after treatment')\n\nplt.xlabel('patient id')\nplt.ylabel('MADRS score')\n\nplt.grid()\n\nplt.legend(['Before', 'After'])\n\nplt.show()\n\nplt.close() ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see the patients who's condition get worsen with red area "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now i will create lists of patients: \n     1) patien who's condition got worsen; \n     2) patient who's condition did not change\n     3) patient who's condition got better"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Remark: list of patients who's condition did not change, will also include patients who's score changed only by few points."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"scores.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"better, stable, worse = [], [], []\n\nfor p_id in range(1, 23):\n   \n    if abs(scores.loc[scores['id'] == p_id, 'madrs2'].values -

Product - product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798 \n2. Gender - Male or Female\n3. Age - in years\n4. Education - in years\n5. MaritalStatus - relationship status, single or partnered\n6. Income - annual household income ($)\n7. Usage - average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week\n8. Miles - average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week\n9.

All non-essential shops, markets and places of worship were closed with only essential services including water, electricity and health services remaining active.\n\nCitizens started to experience better air quality so much so that the scenic Dhauladhar Peaks of Himachal Pradesh became visible from neighbouring states. On normal days, these peaks lie hidden behind he film of smog.\n\n## Objective\nHere we have access to a large amount of granular data relating to the concentration of major air pollutants in India and it will be interesting to see if the claim of reduced air pollution is being actually backed by data.

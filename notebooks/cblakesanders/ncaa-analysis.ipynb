{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**In this notebook, the goal is to see if we can find any trends about why teams win and if those trends continue to mean success in the NCAA Tournament.**\n\nGoing in, I have one hypothesis: the greater the difference between offense and defense efficency, the better success in the NCAA Tournament (playoffs) and the more wins overall. The dataset provides a variety of stats, but I believe that ADJOE(Offensive Efficency) and ADJDE(Defensive Efficency) sum the majority of the columns up. Therefore, I will focus on ADJOE, ADJOE, wins, WAB(Wins Against the Bubble), and POSTSEASON.

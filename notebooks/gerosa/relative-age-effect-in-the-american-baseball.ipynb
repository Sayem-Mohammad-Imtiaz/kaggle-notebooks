Although the intention of providing a fair play for youngsters with similar age, in some sports can be observed a higher chance of participation in the professional level amongst those born early in the selection period. This phenomenon is known as [Relative Age Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect) (RAE).\n\nThe first major study of this effect was published in the Journal of the Canadian Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation in 1985 by Barnsley et al. This study determined that NHL players of the early 1980s were more than four times as likely to be born in the first three months of the calendar year as the last three months.\n\nMalcolm Gladwell explains this effect in his book [Outliers: The Story of Success](http://gladwell.com/outliers/):\n\n>The explanation for this is quite simple. It has nothing to do with astrology, nor is there anything magical about the first three months of the year. It’s simply that in Canada the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1. A boy who turns ten on January 2, then, could be playing alongside someone who doesn’t turn ten until the end of the year — and at that age, in preadolescence, a twelvemonth gap in age represents an enormous difference in physical maturity.\n\n>This being Canada, the most hockey-crazed country on earth, coaches start to select players for the traveling “rep” squad — the all-star teams — at the age of nine or ten, and of course they are more likely to view as talented the bigger and more coordinated players, who have had the benefit of critical extra months of maturity.\n\n>And what happens when a player gets chosen for a rep squad? He gets better coaching, and his teammates are better, and he plays fifty or seventy-five games a season instead of twenty games a season like those left behind in the “house” league, and he practices twice as much as, or even three times more than, he would have otherwise. In the beginning, his advantage isn’t so much that he is inherently better but only that he is a little older. But by the age of thirteen or fourteen, with the benefit of better coaching and all that extra practice under his belt, he really is better, so he’s the one more likely to make it to the Major Junior A league, and from there into the big leagues.\n\n>Barnsley argues that these kinds of skewed age distributions exist whenever three things happen: selection, streaming, and differentiated experience. If you make a decision about who is good and who is not good at an early age; if you separate the “talented” from the “untalented”; and if you provide the “talented” with a superior experience, then you’re going to end up giving a huge advantage to that small group of people born closest to the cutoff date.\n\nIn 1991, Thompson et al. observed a similar effect in the American Baseball. For many years, July 31 was the cutoff date used by virtually all nonschool baseball leagues in the United States. This caused an unfair advantage for players born in August compared to players born in July.\n\nThe goal of this analysis is to observe if this effect is still relevant nowadays."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5affaa39-72ed-fa0c-2764-2d13ad576d67"},"source":"## Questions\n\n* How does the month of birth correlate with the participation rate in the professional leagues?\n* Does the month of birth correlate with the professional player performance, i.e., the unfair advantage of those who have been born earlier in baseball year remains relevant after they became a pro?"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aca8e848-c800-9410-35d2-5bfc91c95357"},"source":"## Data Wrangle"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7ca97f90-4fa2-7ab4-63c2-736772a99b18"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Import Libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n%pylab inline"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c54ec443-52f9-c116-7598-0a1c027906cb"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Creating auxilary series for month names \nmonthNames = pd.Series(\n    ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\n    , index=range(1,13))\n\nrelativeMonthNames = pd.Series(\n     ['Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul'])\n\n# Auxiliary functions\ndef normalizeValues(s):\n    '''returns the proportion of each value in relation to the sum of all values.'''\n    return s / s.sum()\n    "},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f39418fa-a3b9-5c98-e839-06fb7a0a18f2"},"source":"### General population data\nThe general population natality birth data comes from the [Center of Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.nber.org/data/vital-statistics-natality-data.html) (CDC).

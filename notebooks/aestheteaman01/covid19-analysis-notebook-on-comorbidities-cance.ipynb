This notebook wrangles all available datasets and visualizations that are built over the dataset under a single house, to study the effect of COVID-19 on cancer patients.\n\nThis notebook would be updated by me as I find newer analyses into this subject.

As per multiple reports the figures of deviation of the above data is prominent in lung cancer. i.e. Similar symptoms are observed in Lung Cancer as seen in Covid-19 cases.\n\n# Getting to know the details\n\n<H3> 1. The count of blood components </H3>\n\nPatients tested positive for COVID-19 show significantly lower levels of platelets, leukocytes and eosinophils. We can also observe lower levels of calcium and magnesium, but significantly higher concentrations of ferritin, in comparison to patients tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe decrease in white blood cells (leukocytes) can either be a direct result of the COVID-19 infection or other pre-existing conditions. This decrease lowers patient immunity against COVID-19 and other infections in general. Additionally, electrolytes and minerals such as potassium, magnesium and zinc play a critical role in maintaining vitality, repairing cell damage, as well as immunity.\n\n<H3> 2. The Associations </H3>\n\nBy extracting clinical data from the literature, we can examine the abnormalities in blood tests in patients diagnosed with cancer and patients testing positive for COVID-19. Blood test results for multiple minerals were extracted for patients with lung cancer and compared with levels seen in COVID-19 patients. [1,2]\n\nBecause the clinical data available for patients tested for COVID-19 is normalised, measurements retrieved for cancer patients were also normalised using blood concentration in control groups as the mean. The published data has reported the mean and standard deviation of the measurements instead of idividual readings, we use these metrics to simulate mineral concentrations in cancer patients assuming a normal distribution. The measurements retrieved from studies were for Magnesium, Ferritin and Zinc in both cancer patients as well as control groups.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3WgqNGV/2.png\" alt=\"2\" border=\"0\">","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<H3> Analysis of Electrolyte Abnormalities </h3>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gTjCb0X/4.png\" alt=\"4\" border=\"0\">\n\nPatients diagnosed with lung cancer show a wide distribution of ferritin levels, however, it peaks around +0.5 standard deviation unites which is similar to the peak of ferritin levels of patients tested positive for COVID-19. These levels are higher than what is observed for patients tested negative in the COVID-19 test (mean equivalent to -0.5 standard deviation units).\n\nWe can conclude from these observations that patients who retracted COVID-19 have similar electrolyte abnormalities as patients with lung cancer.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Verifying the Results : Cancer and COVID-19","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3> Breakdown of COVID-19 Death Cases in South Korea </h3>\n\nThe following is the dataset that shows the deaths in South Korea by diseases that the patients had suffered.

Green Customer is the one who have low annual income but spend a lot of money on this company, most likely they are satisfied with the service of this company.\n\nB. Yellow Customer is the customer who have high income and high spending on this company, they love to work hard and spend a lot of money.\n\nC. Red Customer is a costumer who have a normal income and normal spending, most likely they just heard about this company product or services.\n\nD. Purple Customer is a costumer who have low annual income and low spending, it is uncertain whether the had a don't like this company product or they just love to save their money.\n\nE. Blue Costumer is the main problem, even though they have a lot of annual income they spend a low amount of money on this company, It is most likely they don't like the services or product, customer in this segment tend to leave.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

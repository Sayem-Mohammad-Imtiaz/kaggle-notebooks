An additional step here could be to compare the dropout rates between the rural and urban schools."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4eee9dae0e1991105b9636d793a95aca67f5ce77"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### We don't have a [Step 4] becuase we haven't modelled our data.\n\n### [Step 5] Results and Conclusions :\n\nWe started out with a comparison of the literacy rates in the different states and union territories in India. We compared the Male and Female literacy rates in these states and saw that there was a huge difference in the states with a low overall literacy rate. The top 3 states were Kerala, Lakshadweep and Mizoram and the bottom 3 were Bihar, Telngana and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nNext we saw that difference in male and female literacy rates, rural population proportion and dropout rates from 8th to 9th class played a huge role in separating the top 3 and bottom 3 states.\n\nFinally, the dropout rates in different classes were explored and while the dropout rate for 6th class was really high, more students had enrolled in class 4 than had dropped out.\n\nThe literacy rate in India has been improving but there are some key issues that need to be tackled aggressively in order to improve the state of education in India. This is not just the job of the govt, but it is the duty of each and everyone living in the country. Hope to see the stats showing a much better India in the future."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"77a3f7580a262c367ca3da0d84e08ab6c8cddec1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Yay. Done !!

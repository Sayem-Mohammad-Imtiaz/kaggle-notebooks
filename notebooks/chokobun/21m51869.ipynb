And the ranking of total number of cases of Brazil is the third place in the world. And the people who fully vaccinated per hundred rate of Brazil is only 8.34, which is ralatively low with regard to the third place of total number of cases. However, from the diagram we can see that the vaccination is keep increasing since 2021.3. \n\nAnd the daily COVID-19 cases is still increasing, especially under the current circumstance which several kinds of Mutated virus was found. And the death curve has been falling as more of its population is vaccinated, while Brazil still suffers from a lack of vaccines.\n\nBrazil’s ability to combat the deadly virus is hampered by extreme political and social polarization. At the same time that many governors and mayors have imposed protective restrictions on economic activities, President Jair Bolsonaro claims that the real threat comes from the economic disruption that the pandemic can cause. He has mocked the efficacy of vaccines and ignored the use of masks when appearing in several large public events. And he is not alone. Throughout Brazil’s major cities, “it is easy to find maskless crowds walking the streets, conversing in close quarters.”\n\nreferences:https://www.theregreview.org/2021/05/24/guerra-filho-risk-regulation-brazil-battle-against-covid-19/\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}

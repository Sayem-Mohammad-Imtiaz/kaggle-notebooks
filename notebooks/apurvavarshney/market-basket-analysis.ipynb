{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Market Based Analysis** is one of the key techniques used by large relations to show associations between items.It allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy together frequently.\n\nGiven a set of transactions, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrences of other items in the transaction.\n\n**Association Rule** – An implication expression of the form X -> Y, where X and Y are any 2 itemsets.\n**Rule Evaluation Metrics** –\n\n**Support(s)** –\nThe number of transactions that include items in the {X} and {Y} parts of the rule as a percentage of the total number of transaction.It is a measure of how frequently the collection of items occur together as a percentage of all transactions.\n**Support = \\sigma(X+Y) \\div total –** \nIt is interpreted as fraction of transactions that contain both X and Y.\n**Confidence(c)** –\nIt is the ratio of the no of transactions that includes all items in {B} as well as the no of transactions that includes all items in {A} to the no of transactions that includes all items in {A}.\n**Conf(X=>Y) = Supp(X\\cupY) \\div Supp(X) –**\nIt measures how often each item in Y appears in transactions that contains items in X also.\n**Lift(l)** –\nThe lift of the rule X=>Y is the confidence of the rule divided by the expected confidence, assuming that the itemsets X and Y are independent of each other.The expected confidence is the confidence divided by the frequency of {Y}.\n**Lift(X=>Y) = Conf(X=>Y) \\div Supp(Y) –**\nLift value near 1 indicates X and Y almost often appear together as expected, greater than 1 means they appear together more than expected and less than 1 means they appear less than expected.Greater lift values indicate stronger association.\n\nSource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/association-rule/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

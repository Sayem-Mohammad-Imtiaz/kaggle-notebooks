Are there any patterns between the given music features and tracks' ranking? \n> There was no apparent pattern between the each music feature and track's ranking. This probably would mean that the given music features cannot be used to predict track's ranking. There must be other less technical and more other features with which we could use to predict ranking.\n    \n2. Are there any notable correlations among the given music features?\n> Important thing to keep in mind: Corelation vs Causation -> if there is any correlation, it doesn't necessarily mean that the features are related \n> positive correlatoins:\n> * loudness vs energy -> the louder, the more energetic\n> * danceability, loudness, energy vs valence -> the more positive, the more dancable, louder, more energetic\n> * speechiness vs danceability -> the more relatively words, the more dancable\n> \n> negative correlations:\n> * acoustcness vs energy -> the less acoustic, the more energetic\n> * acousticness, speechiness vs loudness -> the less acoustic and less words, the more loud \n> * tempo vs danceability -> the higher the tempo, the less dancable the song\n>\n> These are the most apparent ones.

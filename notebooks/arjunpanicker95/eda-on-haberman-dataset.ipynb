Number of Attributes: 4\n2.   Total instances: 306\n3.   Attribute Information:\n      *   **age**: Age of the patient at the time of operation (numerical)\n      *   **year**: Patient's year of operation (numerical)\n      *   **nodes**: Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)\n      *   **status**: Survival status of the patient. (1 - Survived > 5yrs / 2 - Died within 5yrs) (Class attribute)\n4.   The number of **axillary nodes** is an important parameter as the breast cancer usually spreads to the lymph nodes present in near the arm as that is the area which is closest to the breast. The number of axillary lymph nodes helps the doctor to confirm the diagnosis and staging of the cancer. \n5.   Number of null values: 0\n6.   Number of classes: 2\n7.   Number of data points per class: (1 - 225, 2 - 81)\n      *   225 instances of patients who survived for more than 5 yrs after operation\n      *   81 instances of patients who died before 5 yrs of operation\n\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"X5iCcKQdIWuU","outputId":"bb5c05cc-f029-4701-b3b9-faae835037fa","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"t92g0H6Vk3ni","outputId":"7905829d-3062-4d46-bcc9-b0717f569408","scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cols = ['age', 'op_year', 'axil_nodes', 'surv_status']\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/habermans-survival-data-set/haberman.csv', names=cols)\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"RAqSX1qAmX_P","outputId":"0db973aa-0293-46ce-dfe5-be6ed0e2458d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.surv_status.value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Observations:**\n1.

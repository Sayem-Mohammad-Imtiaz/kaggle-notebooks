The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable.

Imagine we are predicting weight (y) from height (x). Our linear regression model representation for this problem would be:\n\n**y = B0 + B1 * x1**\n\nor\n\n**weight =B0 +B1 * height**\n\nWhere B0 is the bias coefficient and B1 is the coefficient for the height column. We use a learning technique to find a good set of coefficient values. Once found, we can plug in different height values to predict the weight.\n\nFor example, lets use B0 = 0.1 and B1 = 0.5. Let‚Äôs plug them in and calculate the weight (in kilograms) for a person with the height of 182 centimeters.\n\nweight = 0.1 + 0.5 * 182\n\nweight = 91.1\n\nYou can see that the above equation could be plotted as a line in two-dimensions. The B0 is our starting point regardless of what height we have. We can run through a bunch of heights from 100 to 250 centimeters and plug them to the equation and get weight values, creating our line.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a

The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file.\n\n## The team identifies the following customer variables to study:\n\n* product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798\n* gender;\n* age, in years;\n* education, in years;\n* relationship status, single or partnered;\n* annual household income ;\n* average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week;\n* average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week;\n* and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing libraries\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# loading the Dataset\n\ncardiodata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/cardiogoodfitness/CardioGoodFitness.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cardiodata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":" cardiodata.describe(include='all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cardiodata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Histograms\n\n### Histograms are likely familiar, and a hist function already exists in matplotlib.

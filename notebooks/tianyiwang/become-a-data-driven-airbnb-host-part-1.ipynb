With a reasonable price, you can find a clean and cute private room in someone's home/property  and live like a local. It‘s really great that the Airbnb data in many major cities are now available online and we can be our own data scientists to plan our next trips or create strategies for our listings (if you are a host!)\n\nThis notebook is a comprehensive exploration on the Boston Airbnb data (but without the touch of any modeling yet). Although the analysis can be used in various ways, I'd like to recommend you to image that **you are a new host on the market who's planning the debut for your lovely apartment ;)**.\n\nSome of the business questions to be solved in this notebook:\n\n* How do hosts describe their listings? What aspects will they include? How do they describe them?\n* Descriptive analysis on the hosts and their lisitngs\n* What do customers say in their reviews? What do they care?\n* Display negative comments on an aspect (e.g. bed, bathrooms)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501979376754-2ff867a4f659?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=3300&q=80)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

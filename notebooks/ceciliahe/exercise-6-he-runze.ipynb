The first case was happened in January 28,2020. From April 2 to May 4, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 virus is quite high and volatile. This period of time could be the outbreak period of the COVID-19 in Canada. On April 5,2020, there are 2778 people was confirmed by COVID-19 which was the largest daily confirmed cases in Canada. On April 16,2020, 251 people dead because of COVID-19, which was the largest daily deaths cases in Canada. From May 7,2020, daily confirmed cases in Canada could have a slightly down trend. There has one good thing need to be noticed is that, since the beginning of June, 80% of the daily recovery cases are more than daily confirmed cases. The situation in Canada due to the COVID-19 could be getting better as I think. \n  \n  Many of my high school classmates are studying in Canada right now, I also ask one of my friend about her daily life in Canada. She told me that most of the companies are still working from home, and she works at home as well. There are very few people on the road, but places like supermarkets and restaurants have returned to normal mostly. At present, people's panic about the COVID-19 has gradually decreased. During this period of time, people's health and safety awareness has been greatly improved.\n\nThe national government in Canada support to date for COVID-191 about 101 million dollars in total. Firsty, the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB) provides financial support to post-secondary students, and recent post-secondary and high school graduates who are unable to find work due to COVID-19. From May to August 2020, the CESB provides a payment to eligible students of 1,250 dollars for each 4-week period, or 2,000 dollars if students have dependants or a disability. Also, as a Canadian employer whose business has been affected by COVID-19, they may be eligible for a subsidy of 75% of employee wages for up to 24 weeks, retroactive from March 15, 2020, to August 29, 2020. In order to prevent layoffs and encourage employers to keep employees in the company during turbulent times, the Canadian government has introduced a wage subsidy policy, which will provide subsidies to companies that are in financial difficulties due to the new crown epidemic. The amount of subsidies is 3 months to all employees. 10% of the salary, up to 1375 dollars per employee, and up to 25000 dollars per employer.\nWhat's more, the Canadian government has also launched many policies to help people stay away from the infections of COVID-19 in their daily lives. Such as encourage customers to limit the number of people shopping together to 2 or 1 person per shopping cart, and promote physical distancing such as in lines at entrances, in check-out lines and inside the stores by using markers every 2 metres. Operators of parks, playgrounds, public swimming pools and campgrounds should limite large gatherings and controlling the number of admissions to facilities to prevent overcrowding to lower the spread of COVID-19. Also, for Public Transportation, drivers and passengers should be wearing non-medical masks or cloth face coverings. \n\nIn fact, there are many policies on the Canadian government official homepage to response with the COVID-19. The correspondence steps is very detailed, which makes me think that the Canadian government is seriously responding to the COVID-19 in this period of time.\n\nReference：\nThe website of the Canadian government's official website dedicated to publishing Corona virus related policies and information：https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

We will go cluster by cluster and see how can we improve customer spending scores:\n### **Cluster 0 (Low Spending Score, Upper-middle Income, All Ages, 68% Males)**\nThis cluster has a great potential because income level is higher than the average income. Most customers in this segment are males which is not common for the dataset. We suggest to take a look at product line that males potentially could buy for themselves, their partners and children. High-end products can be included for this segment.\n\n### **Cluster 1 (Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Old Age, 57% Females)**\nThis cluster is one of the middle segments with respect to income/spending. The cluster consists of males and females with little dominance of latter (by 7%). The segment is already intrested in purchases from the mall and probably have a list of regular products they tend to buy. Analysing those products could help to perform cross-selling of related products as well as offering occasionally high-end upsells. \n\n### **Cluster 2 (High Spending Score, Upper-middle income, Middle Age, 52% Females)**\n\nThis is one of the most profitable segments. This segment contains almost the same distribution of males and females. High-end general purpose products are good stuff to promote in the segment.\n\n### **Cluster 3 (High Spending Score, Low Income, Young Ages, 59% Females)**\n\nCustomers from this segment have already showed a good spending activity, but they most likely limited in terms of budget. They may be good candidates for promotion/coupon campaigns. In worse case, they would not increase their spendings.\n\n### **Cluster 4 (Low Spending Score, Low Income, All Ages, 59% Females)**\n\nThis segment includes customers with low spending score and low income across all ages. There are slightly more women. Customers from this cluster would be happy to save money. Including them to any kind of promotion lists or providing accumulation accounts may help to increase purchase activities.\n\n### **Cluster 5 (Middle Spending Score, Middle Income, Young Age, 66% Females)**\n\nThis is a counterpart of Cluster 1 with a larger percentage of females and younger ages. This segment has a good potetial, so deals that include tranding stuff for young female audiance may help to increase spendings of the segment.\n\n### **Cluster 6 (Low Spending Score, High Income, Middle Ages, 70% Females)**\n\nThis segment is similar to Cluster 0, but with mostly female audience. Hence, suggestion is the same but with main focus on female's needs.\n\n### **Cluster 7 (High Spending Score, High Income, Middle Ages, 60% Females)**\n\nThis is one of the most profitable segments.

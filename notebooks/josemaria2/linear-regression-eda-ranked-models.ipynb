Said that, I would also like to point out several lessons that I have learned by conducting this analysis: \n\n### * Firstly,speding time with preprocessing is really worth it. We all are always looking and testing different algorithms, and that is quite ok. Nevertheless, we should not forget that a simple preprocessing can add extra performance to the model with simple transformations and calculations. \n### * Secondly, comparing and testing different algorithms is part of our job. So no discussion here regarding wether to stick to one technique or try different ones.\n\n\n### As previously stated, if we had to choose one of them, it is clear that we would choose the last one: Random Forest Regressio, since it reaches the highest R2 metric. \n### A preprocessing technique that I have not used is outlier elimination and it would be a good idea to insert it within the pipeline and check the impact on performance. \n\n### A model that I have not tested is Artificial Neural Network, which is a quite powerful one. I will definitely use it in future versions and exercises.

A few conclusions can be drawn here:\n\n**1. People are more prone to overpaying now as compared to last time.**\n\nThe ratio of a player's transfer fee to their actual market value is given by the gradient of the graph. By inspection, the most recent years, namely 2015-2018, have had both the highest gradient and the biggest impact on the aggregated best fit line as there are more lines below the aggregated best fit line than there are above the best fit line.\n\nThus it should be noted that overpayment is a relatively recent phenomenon and it has become more pronounced in recent years.\n\n**HOWEVER**, it is very important to caveat that market values for many players were listed as null values in the DataFrame we were working with, especially for earlier years, and this may lead to inaccuracies within the data. While this does not change the fact that teams are overpaying for players, this may mask the extent of overpayment in past years.\n\n**2. Inflation is a big thing in football transfers, and even more so recently.**\n\nMarket value and transfer fees are both a representation of larger economic forces (e.g. inflation) at play. While it is impossible to determine whether Neymar in 2017 was objectively a better player than Ronaldo in 2009, it cannot be denied that inflation has taken place in that span as the large majority of outlying points are from recent years (2015-2018). \n\n**3. That being said, market value is subjective.**\n\nIt is important to note that these figures are not representative of a player's actual value, and as different clubs will value different players differently, there is no such thing as an inherently quantifiable market value for a player. So it's definitely possible and likely that Juve didn't overpay for an ageing Ronaldo, or PSG for Neymar - after all, the only valuation that actually matters is that of the team buying the player and selling the player.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"goalkeepers = transfers_cleaned[transfers_cleaned['Position']=='Goalkeeper']\ngoalkeepers.sort_values(['Transfer_fee_in_mln'],ascending =False).head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.613909Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.614439Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.635822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.614372Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.635022Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cb = transfers_cleaned[transfers_cleaned['Position']=='Centre-Back']\ncb.sort_values(['Transfer_fee_in_mln'],ascending =False).head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.637798Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.638169Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.664567Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.638139Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:06.663446Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Just a few examples to qualitatively explain my points - prices for elite players have gone up recently even in defensive positions, and the overpayment is very pronounced for defenders.

Of course, this isn't good by any means. \n\nThat being said, 21% is actually remarkably good as these variables say at most little about a player's ability, which should be the main determinant of the transfer fee. This goes to show that at least a certain level of correlation exists between a player's non-ability-related attributes and his transfer fee. The most obvious possible conclusion is that when selling to certain teams, the price range will be higher. This may have less to do with the inherent ability of the player and more of the resources of the owner - Chelsea, Man City and PSG are all owned by really rich people and thus have spent higher fees on players. Whether this correlation is related to the hypothesis that 'as teams get richer, they will buy better players' requires more discussion.\n\nFor that reason, we will carry on to analyse if transfer fees of players can be estimated WITH factors relating to their playing ability.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**How much can we improve our model by?**\n\nSo while quantitatively judging a player's ability may be difficult - although we are sure that Ronaldo and Messi are one tier ahead of everyone else, how do we know where great players like Hazard, Mbappe, Haaland etc stand in respect to each other?\n\nThe best option would be to use FIFA overall and potential ratings as a proxy for a player's inherent present and future quality. While there has and always will be debate about the legitimacy of FIFA ratings, it's the best we have that is closest to a measure of a player's ability.

Data only exists from 2015 to 2021, and transfer data is up till 2018.\n\nFor this, we have no choice but to use only the FIFA 15 to 18 ratings within the dataset.\n\n2. The way data is inputted in the two datasets are different.\n\nFor example, the transfers dataset may list Manchester United as 'Man Utd', while the FIFA dataset lists it as 'Manchester United'. To standardise, I will use fuzzywuzzy to find the most similar team names (e.g. Barcelona and FC Barcelona) above a certain scoring threshold, and standardise the names as such.\n\nAs for player names, only their last names will be included in the data. While this may lead to potential inconsistencies within the data (it was observed that there are three Martinez's in Porto), it will greatly simplify the joining process of the two dataframes together, which was more critical given that this was done during the span of two days.\n\nDue to the presence of certain special characters, all data will be converted to ASCII format as well in order to facilitate joining of the two dataframes. \n\nFinally, a round of manual replacement will be done. However, as it is likely that many values may not be similar still, the target is to end up with 75% of the data from the 2015-2018 transfers.\n\n3. Transfer data may cause inconsistencies within the FIFA dataset.\n\nWas the information in the FIFA dataset collected before or after the transfer was conducted? It is equally likely that both are possible given that there are two transfer windows in a season and FIFA is released in between both of them. \n\nTo prevent ambiguity as much as possible, the transfer data will first be merged on the team the player left (the Team_from column). The null values will then be collected and will be re-merged on the team the player joined (the Team_to column). As such, whether the data was collected before or after the player was transferred, it will be still be accounted for.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fifa_15 = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset/players_15.csv',usecols = ['short_name','overall','potential','club'])\nfifa_15['Season'] = 2015\nfifa_16 = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset/players_16.csv',usecols = ['short_name','overall','potential','club'])\nfifa_16['Season'] = 2016\nfifa_17 = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset/players_17.csv',usecols = ['short_name','overall','potential','club'])\nfifa_17['Season'] = 2017\nfifa_18 = pd.read_csv('../input/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset/players_18.csv',usecols = ['short_name','overall','potential','club'])\nfifa_18['Season'] = 2018","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:07.559066Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:07.559815Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.146166Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:07.559762Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.145405Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fifas_merged = pd.concat([fifa_15,fifa_16,fifa_17,fifa_18],ignore_index=True)\nfifas_merged['Lastname'] = fifas_merged['short_name'].str.split(' ').str[-1]\nfifas_merged = fifas_merged.drop(columns = ['short_name'])\nfifas_merged.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.147397Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.147736Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.73252Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.147703Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.731509Z"},"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from fuzzywuzzy import process\nunique = transfers_cleaned_2015_18.Team_from.unique()\nfor team in fifas_merged.club.unique():\n    for found, score in process.extract(team,unique,limit = 1):\n        if score > 80:\n            fifas_merged['club']=fifas_merged['club'].replace([team],found)\n\nfifas_merged.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.733827Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.734129Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.374609Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:08.734099Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.373601Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fifas_merged['Lastname'] = fifas_merged['Lastname'].str.normalize('NFKD')\\\n       .str.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')\\\n       .str.decode('utf-8')\nfifas_merged['club'] = fifas_merged['club'].str.normalize('NFKD')\\\n       .str.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')\\\n       .str.decode('utf-8')\ntransfers_cleaned_2015_18['Lastname'] = transfers_cleaned_2015_18['Lastname'].str.normalize('NFKD')\\\n       .str.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')\\\n       .str.decode('utf-8')\ntransfers_cleaned_2015_18['Team_from'] = transfers_cleaned_2015_18['Team_from'].str.normalize('NFKD')\\\n       .str.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')\\\n       .str.decode('utf-8')\ntransfers_cleaned_2015_18['Team_to'] = transfers_cleaned_2015_18['Team_to'].str.normalize('NFKD')\\\n       .str.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')\\\n       .str.decode('utf-8')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.375704Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.375974Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.656878Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.375949Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T13:18:23.6561Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#fifas_merged['Lastname']=fifas_merged['Lastname'].replace(to_replace = '.*ić$',value = '.*ic$',regex = True)\nfifas_merged['club']=fifas_merged['club'].replace(to_replace = ['FC Girondins de Bordeaux','Manchester United','Manchester City','Tottenham Hotspur','Olympique Lyonnais','Borussia Dortmund','Wolverhampton Wanderers','Galatasaray SK','FC Bayern München'],\\\n                                                  value = ['G.

The transfer fee of a player is heavily correlated to their market value, rather than their overall/potential.**\n\nIn an earlier run, initialising the RF regressor, I was only able to obtain about 44% accuracy when dropping the market value column (please try it out for yourself too!). This is interesting as if we assume that FIFA ratings are a somewhat accurate representation of conventional opinions of player current and future ability, that the market valuations of players are very much divorced from the actual price a player is sold for. I initially assumed that market value and FIFA judgments of ability were rather correlated, which explains why I wanted to drop the feature. It turns out that both market value and FIFA ratings are far from correlated. \n\nIf we compare our results from the first linear regression (which admittedly is a much simpler model), the effect of adding market value as a consideration far outweighs the effect of adding the FIFA ratings to the model. Should we take heart in the wisdom of the FIFA experts, it is very much possible that teams could be overpaying and/or getting bargains for players in the transfer market.\n\n**2. This model is REALLY limited.**\n\nThis model suffers from a lack of data with only three years' worth of transfer data present, of which only 73% was used due to difficulties in the data cleaning process. Furthermore, FIFA ratings are insufficient in determining the ability of a player, and composite measures (maybe football stats from Opta) would give a more accurate picture of how good/bad a player is. With more data, the model can be improved to a higher accuracy.\n\n**3. Our model is affected by the outliers heavily.**\n\nOur mean-squared error stands at about 47.90, which makes for a root mean-squared-error of about 6.92million. Looking at the previous scatterplot of market value against transfer fees, we see that many players are sold for below 25 million. A rmse of roughly 7 million would thus be rather significant to the predictions given by the model.\n\nHowever, taking into the context of the previous data analysis, 2015-2018 was when most of the outliers on the graph popped up, and the error in predicting big-money transfers such as Neymar's, Mbappe's, Coutinho's etc which all cost above of 100 million would push up the rmse. The accuracy of 80.0% should be focused on instead rather than the mse metric in this case due to the wide variation of transfer fees at one end of the spectrum.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nThank you all for bearing with me, and I hope you enjoyed this dive into Football Transfer Analysis and had as much fun as I had.

Introduction to Business Problem <a name=\"introduction\"></a>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"   ### Background \n  \n  My client is a successful entrepreneur in Europe. It's only been 3 years since he started his business. But now, in 2020, He has 16 Fried Chicken Restaurants in big cities of Europe like Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Amsterdam etc.  And now, he wants to expand his business in other countries. He has a particular interest in Canada. So, he wants to open a new restaurant in Toronto.\n  \n  ### Business Problem\n\nIn this project we will try to find an optimal location for a new __Fried Chicken Restaurant__ in Toronto, Canada. Since there are lots of restaurants in Toronto, we will try to detect locations that are not already so crowded with venues, especially  restaurants. By the way, the place should not be too secluded. \nWe are particularly interested in a potential neighborhood with no Fried Chicken Restaurant in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to the city center as possible to attract more customers, assuming that the first two conditions are met.\n\n   We will use some data science and machine learning techniques to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on these criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by my client.\n  \n\n   ### About Toronto\n  \n  Toronto is Canada’s largest city and a world leader in such areas as business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world. \n  So Toronto has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition. \n  \n  ### Target Audience\n   \n   Specifically, this report will be targeted to my client who wants to find the optimal location to open a new Fried Chicken Joint in Toronto. But the other stakeholders interested in the same kind of opportunity can also benefit from it.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

There are mostly business areas with coffee shops, pizza places, restaurants, bar, etc.. There are also social activity venues. Some of the neighborhoods are close to the University of Toronto. So they are at the center of Toronto. So it means high cost high gain for a new business. Some of the neighborhoods are far away from the center.  \n\n\n- __Cluster 2 :__ 40% of neighborhoods are in this cluster. There are mostly business areas with cafe, restaurants, bar, etc..

Conclusion <a name=\"conclusion\"></a>\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The purpose of this project was to identify Toronto areas close to center with normal number of restaurants and venues in order to aid my client in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Fried Chicken Restaurant. By seeing the density of restaurants and venues from Foursquare data we have identified the borouhgs that don't have a Fried Chicken Restaurant and also have a normal density of venues and restaurants. \n\n1. Regent Park, Harbourfront \n  \n   -  According to the criteria and results of this analysis, it seems as the best option.\n   -  The venues and restaurants density is not saturated.\n   -  There is not other chicken restaurant so close.\n   -  The neighborhood is close to the center of the city and other neighborhoods that don't have a fried chicken restaurant \n\n\n2. Kensington Market, Chinatown, Grange Park \n\n   - It may be the best option but there are two other fried chicken restaurants close by.   \n   - High cost, high gain for a new business\n\n\n3. Fairview, Henry Farm, Oriole \n\n   - Good place to start with a new business in a new country to see how it will work. \n   - Moderate cost, moderate risk.\n\nThe final decission on optimal restaurant location will be made by my client based on specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood, etc."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## I am waiting for your comment to improve my works \n\n## By the way, if you like this notebook thanks for Upvoting :)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

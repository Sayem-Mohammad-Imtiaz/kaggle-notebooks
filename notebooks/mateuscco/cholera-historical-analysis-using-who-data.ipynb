In 2017, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Yemen and Somalia caused 1.227.391 cases, which is 929% higher than 2016 and doubled the previous record of cases. This shows that cholera is still a dangerous disease to a large part of the population who doesn't have access to water sanitation and clean food. **In this kernel I will make an historical analysis of the disease progression and inspect which development and public health indexes are more correlated with the cholera incidence. My goal is to shed a light on this thorny issue. If you like it, please consider giving it an upvote.** \n\nIn order to do so, I utilized data from the World Health Organization, which anually collect reports from its members and compiles them in their website. About three milion cases occur every year, but, as we will see, the number of reported ones is way lower than that. This happens because some of the most affected countries doesn't have enough money and capacity to make a good cholera surveillance. **Therefore, it is necessary to make a disclaimer: this analysis is limited and we are only seeing part of the problem.**\n\nBefore we start, let's understand what Cholera is. It can affects both children and adults and for most of them it won't cause any symptom. However, the bacteria will be present in their faeces for up to 10 days and will possibly infect other people if sanitation is not present. A minority of people will develop acute watery diarrhoea that, if not treated, can kill within hours. Besides that, most cases of cholera can be easily treated with oral rehydration solution. According to WHO, \"a multifaceted approach is key to control cholera, and to reduce deaths. A combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines are used\". Since 1990, three oral vaccines that cost at most $4 have been developed.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Importing data and libs](#importing-data)\n- [Data preparation](#data-prep)\n    * [First look at the data](#prep-first)\n    * [Inspecting supposedly numeric columns](#prep-insp)\n    * [Missing values](#prep-miss)\n- [Exploratory analysis](#eda)\n    * [How is the disease spreading globally over time?](#eda-global-time)\n    * [What are the regions most affected by Cholera?](#eda-region-time)\n    * [Visualizing the disease progression with an animated world map](#eda-country-time)\n    * [How many countries report Cholera cases every year?](#eda-report-time)\n    * [Which country is more affected?](#eda-bar-country)\n    * [Where is the death rate high?](#eda-bar-death-rate)\n    * [Is chorela incidence correlated with human development indexes?](#eda-corr)\n    * [What is the impact of water treatment in the spread of cholera?](#eda-water)\n\n## Importing data and libs <a id ='importing-data'></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Standard packages\nimport json\n\n# Libs to deal with tabular data\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\npd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None\n\n# Plotting packages\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.axes_style(\"darkgrid\")\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.style.use('seaborn')\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# To display stuff in notebook\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/cholera-dataset/data.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data preparation <a id ='data-prep'></a>\n\n### First look at the data <a id ='prep-first'></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.rename(columns={\n    'Number of reported cases of cholera':'Cases',\n    'Number of reported deaths from cholera':'Deaths',\n    'Cholera case fatality rate':'Death rate',\n    'WHO Region':'Region'\n})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Inspecting supposedly numeric columns <a id ='prep-insp'></a>\n\nSince the columns cases, deaths and death rate should be numeric, I tried to look for non-numeric characters to figure out problems.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['Cases'].str.contains('[^0-9\\.]').astype(bool) & df['Cases'].notnull()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['Deaths'].str.contains('[^0-9\\.]').astype(bool) & df['Deaths'].notnull()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df[df['Death rate'].str.contains('[^0-9\\.]').astype(bool) & df['Death rate'].notnull()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the next cells I will fix the dataset in order to keep only numeric data in the cases, deaths and death rate columns.

Global health authorities should look at this issue in a more careful way because there is a vaccine being produced since the beggining of 19th centure and it is cheap.\n- In 2010, Haiti and Dominican Republic had a huge number of cases.

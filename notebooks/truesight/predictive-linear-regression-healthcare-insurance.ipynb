It is the public perception that the rate/charges is determined by many factors, such as age, gender, smoking status, occupation, and so forth. It is essential to understand what factors affect the rates/charges to make informed decision.

Thus, the target feature or y-variable is \"charges\".","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Process:\n### The project will start off with basic descriptive analysis, followed by detailed exploratory data analysis, data visualization on features, and data cleansing.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Potential Impact\n### As a consumer, it is beneficial to understand which factor carries more weight and have more impact on the charges. This can help patients to make informed decision. As for insurance companies, it helps to have a deeper understand their target audience and improve strategy on policy/coverage. Knowledge on specific population can help identify potential opportunities, such as population health, preventive health measures promotion, and so forth. This ultimately can have a positive impact on profitability.

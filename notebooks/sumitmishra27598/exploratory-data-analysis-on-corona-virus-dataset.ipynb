number of cases from one day to next day are completely random as the number of cases increases day by day are independent of each other.\n* As of now let's assume number of new cases each day is proportional to the number of existing cases, it means each day it's get multiplied by a constant.\n* Intuitively it means as the date changes, the number of confirmed cases also increases as they both are directly proportional to each other.\n* So, if we compare total cases from one day to next day, then tracking the changes between number of cases is nothing but the growth factor.\n* Simply growth factor is the ratio between two successive changes and that resultant ratio is the constant that get multiplied each day.\n* So, with existing accumulated data(number of cases each day), we'll predict the expected number of cases for future dates by using Linear Regresion which is one of the simplest but powerful concept of machine learning.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h4>Input and Output:</h4>\n* In this model, we'll take all unique confirmed date and total number of cases for that date as an input.\n*

is unique for every patient.\n* For every confirmed date, it's count value will be sum of total case for that day plus sum of total case for all preceding date(i.e. accumulated count).\n* And the

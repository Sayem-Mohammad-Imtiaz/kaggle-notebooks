The features are selected on the basis of variance that they cause in the output. The feature that causes highest variance is the first principal component. The feature that is responsible for second highest variance is considered the second principal component, and so on. It is important to mention that principal components do not have any correlation with each other.**\n\n*Advantages of PCA\nThere are two main advantages of dimensionality reduction with PCA.\nThe training time of the algorithms reduces significantly with less number of features.\nIt is not always possible to analyze data in high dimensions. For instance if there are 100 features in a dataset. Total number of scatter plots required to visualize the data would be 100(100-1)2 = 4950. Practically it is not possible to analyze data this way.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Normalization of Features\nIt is imperative to mention that a feature set must be normalized before applying PCA. For instance if a feature set has data expressed in units of Kilograms, Light years, or Millions, the variance scale is huge in the training set. If PCA is applied on such a feature set, the resultant loadings for features with high variance will also be large. Hence, principal components will be biased towards features with high variance, leading to false results.** \n\n*Finally, the last point to remember before we start coding is that PCA is a statistical technique and can only be applied to numeric data. Therefore, categorical features are required to be converted into numerical features before PCA can be applied.*"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib as plt\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/iris-flower-dataset/IRIS.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1:**\nThe first preprocessing step is to divide the dataset into a feature set and corresponding labels."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = df.drop('species', 1)\ny = df['species']\nX,y","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)\n#X_train,X_test,y_train,y_test","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**As mentioned earlier, PCA performs best with a normalized feature set.

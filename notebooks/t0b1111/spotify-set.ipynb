Which means user is not concerned about them in first place.\nBut on the other hand energy and loudness gives us more information about user's song choices. In both of them dislike is more right skewed than liked songs. Also if we observe key, 4th key songs are mostly disliked by user where as 3rd key songs are liked by him.So in sense we can conclude that data is not random.

This is a kind of Market Basket analysis.\nAssociation rules tell us that two or more items are related. Metrics allow us to quantify the usefulness of those relationships. In this analysis I will apply different metrics to evaluate association rules and I will interpret support, confidence, and lift metrics. I will use association rules and metrics to increase the sales of a grocery store. The data using in this project will be retrieved from \"https://www.kaggle.com/shazadudwadia/supermarket\".\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n!pip install mlxtend\nfrom mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/supermarket/GroceryStoreDataSet.csv',\n                 names = ['products'], header = None)\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = list(df['products'].apply(lambda x:x.split(',')))\ndata","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"te = TransactionEncoder()\nte_data = te.fit(data).transform(data)\ndf = pd.DataFrame(te_data, columns = te.columns_)\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = apriori(df, min_support = 0.2, use_colnames=True, verbose =1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"association_rules(df1, metric = 'confidence', min_threshold = 0.6)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The interpretation of a row based on support, confidence, and lift metrics:\n - Milk and bread are seen together in 20% of all purchases (support).\n - 80% of customers who buy milk also buy bread (confidence).\n - Sales of bread increased by 1.23 times in shopping with milk (lift).\n\n    According to these results, in order to attract customers' attention to less sold products and to increase the sales of these products, I recommend the grocery market management to place bread and milk on shelves far from each other. I also recommend management placing other targeted products on the shelves in the sections that customers are most likely to pass through to reach milk and bread.\n\n ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

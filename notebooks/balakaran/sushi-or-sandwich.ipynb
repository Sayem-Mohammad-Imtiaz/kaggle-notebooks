OS: Windows 10 (not pro)\n\nInstall docker for windows:\n 1. Docker does not run natively on windows\n 2. If the OS is not Windows 10 pro, docker is set up through Docker Toolbox.\n 3. For setting up Docker Toolbox - see    https://rominirani.com/docker-setup-windows-4d65c3f691eb#.h4iulfohl\n\n**step-1:** \nclick on \"Docker Quickstart Terminal\" on windows to launch. This launches a docker machine - a virtual machine named \"default\" through the oracle virtual box. I increased resource allocation from the default allocation of  1GB RAM and 1 cpu.\n\n**step-2:**\nOpen up command prompt window on Windows OS. Since step-1 created the docker machine, we can issue docker-machine comands from cmd. \n\nThe command \"docker-machine ls\" will list the the running virtual machine along with the name \"default\". Note you can create as many virtual machines as you need from cmd using \"docker-machine create --driver drivername vmname\" command.\n\n**step-3: Running the docker client**\nThe docker clients run on a specific virtual machine.  This means we need to tell the client where the docker host is (oracle virtual box) and to which virtual machine to target\n\nC:\\Users\\B>docker-machine env --shell cmd default\n\nSET DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\nSET DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.99.100:2376\nSET DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\\Users\\B\\.docker\\machine\\machines\\default\nSET DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME=default\nSET COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=true\nREM Run this command to configure your shell:\nREM     @FOR /f \"tokens=*\" %i IN ('docker-machine env --shell cmd default') DO @%i\n\nIf you just run the following on cmd:\n@FOR /f \"tokens=*\" %i IN ('docker-machine env --shell cmd default') DO @%i\n\nAll the aboe env variables will be setup.  We can then issue client (docker) commands from cmd targetting the \"default\" docker virtual machine.\n\n**step-4:**\nNow we want to make the windows folder (from C drive) available to the docker virtual machine named \"default\" so that that the container (or conainers) running on that machine can make use of these folders. Issue the command from CMD:\n\n**C:\\Users\\B> docker run -it --name cookpadcontainer -v /c/Users:/datavol gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-devel**\n\nThis identifies the windows folder /c/Users as /datavol on the docker virtual machine. We also need to make sure that /c/Users windows folder is shared in the \"default\" vm running on your windows machine (usually oracle virtualbox). This is because the host machine is not the windows laptop but the virtual machine running on the windows laptop.\n\nRemember we are targetting \"default\" vm - the above command targets \"default\" vm because we had set upthe env variables (step-3). Make sure on windows \\c\\Users have write permission for training the .\n\nThe above comand results in:\n 1. downloading the tensorflow image;\n 2. creating a container called cookpadcontaner; and \n 3. making the windows folder available to the docker virtual machine.\n\n**step-5:**\nNow you will be inside the named container cookpadcontainer. if you cd /datavol, you can see the folders that were present in C:/Users on windows.\n\n**step-6: Retrieving the Trainer (Inception V3)**\nThe docker image contains the latest GitHub TF tools. To retrieve the training code, execute the following command from inside the container:\n\n**cd /tensorflow\ngit pull**\n\nYour training code will now be in (Inception v3)\n/tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/image_retraining\n\n**step-7: Download and Train Inception**\ncd to /tensorflow and issue the following python command:\n\n    python tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py \\\n    > --bottleneck_dir=/datavol/bottlenecks \\\n    > --how_many_training_steps 1000 \\\n    > --model_dir=/datavol/inception \\\n    > --output_graph=/datavol/retrained_graph.pb \\\n    > --output_labels=/datavol/retrained_labels.txt \\\n    > --image_dir /datavol/Food/sushi_or_sandwich\n\nTo start the container and to get in (interactive):\n\ndocker start -i containername"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ec2a64ff-2859-470d-de00-6cb15d12019a"},"source":"Notes:\n\n790 images each.\nbatch size 10\nIteration  100\nfinal test accuracy is 89.8%\n"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

Here, the MAE is much worse, making this dataset less useable for predictions. \nIt seems to me that the dataset does not help very much to explain what makes a student successful or not. To predict student performance better, probably other variables might be considered, like the quality of the school, the teachers and learning materials used, motivation and attitude of the student, their IQ, the composition of the class and socio-economical factors.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sources:\n\nUSING DATA MINING TO PREDICT SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT PERFORMANCE, Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva\nhttp://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez/student.pdf\n\nLasso: https://github.com/krishnaik06/Advanced-House-Price-Prediction-\n\nKaggle Intermediate Machine Learing Course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning\n\nClassification; https://stackabuse.com/overview-of-classification-methods-in-python-with-scikit-learn/\n\nImage: https://odinland.vn/a-comprehensive-guide-about-the-education-system-in-portugal/?lang=en\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JXrxCJoHuw&list=PLZoTAELRMXVMcRQwR5_J8k9S7cffVFq_U&index=6","metadata":{}}]}

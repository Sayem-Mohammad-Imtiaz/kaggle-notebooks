Simply copy and edit this kernel and modify the query below. *Click Run All the first time* which will install all required software and models for the session. After that, you can simply edit and run the query. \n\nResults are shown inline with Markdown and exported to CSV.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Query Guide\n\nThe input format for queries in [YML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html). Every query is required to have a field named \"query\", which has the search query for finding/retrieving documents. The query should be a series of keywords. The default method does not require any of the words to be present in results as it uses a similarity query. But if a term must be present, it can be prefixed with a plus (+).\n\nExample queries:\n\n**antiviral treatment**<br/>\nReturns all documents with the concept of antiviral treatment\n \n**+antiviral treatment**<br/>\nReturns all documents with the concept of antiviral treatment. Requires matches to have the term antiviral.\n\nColumns:\n\nQueries can have any of the following default columns:\n\n- Date\n- Study\n- Study Link\n- Journal\n- Study Type\n- Sample Size\n- Study Population\n- Matches\n- Entry\n\nAdditional generated columns can also be added. Currently, two types of columns are supported, constant columns and query columns.\n\n- **constant column**: Generates a column with a constant value<br/>\n{name: Name, constant: Value}\n\n- **query column**: Runs a subquery against each matching document to pull out additional information<br/>\n{name: Country, query: country city, question: What location}<br/>\n\nThe column above is named country and has a context query to find text within each search result matching country or city. This is important as the question/answer model work best on small snippets of text vs a whole document. The question field is the actual question to ask of the matching content.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\nfrom cord19reports import install\n\n# Install report dependencies\ninstall()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture --no-display\nfrom cord19reports import report, render\n\ntask = \"\"\"\nname: query\n\nantiviral covid-19 success treatment:\n    query: antiviral covid-19 success treatment\n    columns:\n        - name: Date\n        - name: Study\n        - name: Study Link\n        - name: Journal\n        - name: Study Type\n        - {name: Country, query: what country}\n        - {name: Drugs, query: what drugs tested}\n        - name: Sample Size\n        - name: Study Population\n        - name: Matches\n        - name: Entry\n\"\"\"\n\n# Build and render report\nreport(task)\nrender(\"query\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

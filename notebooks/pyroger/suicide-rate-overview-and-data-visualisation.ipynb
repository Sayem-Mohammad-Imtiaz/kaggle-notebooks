The gap between the numbers seems\nto get smaller with the bigger gap between the first two age categories.\nThe gap between gender remains the same here too, with still a ratio of\n3 to 1 with a bigger gap in the top list category (35-54) where the gap is nearly 4 to 1.\nHere a summary of which countries are in the top 5 list per age category:\n\n35-54 \n\n1. Russian Federation\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Ukraine\n5. France\n\n55-74\n\n1. Japan\n2. Russian Federation\n3. United States\n4. Ukraine\n5. Germany\n\n25-34\n\n1. Russian Federation\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Brazil\n5. Ukraine\n\n15-24\n\n1. Russian Federation\n2. United States\n3. Japan\n4. Brazil\n5. Mexico\n\n75+\n\n1. Japan\n2. United States\n3. Russian Federation\n4. France\n5. Germany\n\n5-14\n\n1. United States\n2. Russian Federation\n3. Mexico\n4. Brazil\n5. Japan\n\nWe observe how Russian Federation and United States are present in every single\ncategory in one of the top three spot, swapping position only with Japan, another country to be\npresent in every single category at the top 3 apart from the 5-14 category where is\nin the lowest position. \nMexico and Brazil, appearing respectively twice and three times seems to cover the younger\nspectrum of the age category (15-24 / 5-14 for Mexico, 5-14 / 15-24 / 25-34 for Brazil) \nwith France and Germany, appearing both twice, covering the older spectrum. \nUkraine is the other European country appearing three times, covering 25-34 / 35-54 / 55-74 years of age.\n\n- Grouping by gender:\n\nAs mentioned before, the gender gap seems to be constant around 3 times more \nmale cases than female.\n\n- Grouping by generation:\n\nThe generation more affected by high suicide rate seems to be the Boomers, followed by\nthe Silent generation, the Generation X, Millenials and G.I. Generation\n\n- Grouping by country:\n\nAfter covering the 15 countries with the highest and lowest number of cases,\nwe observe how Russian Federation and United States cover the top 2 spots with \na quite big gap between them and the third spot (Japan).\nThe gender analysis seems to show the same result, with pretty much the same ratio.\nConsidering the years from 1990 to 1999, where we observe a steady growth in cases, I wanted to highlight the top 5 countries per suicides number. \nWe observe how Russian Federation is always at the first spot, followed by USA and Japan in almost every year.\nOnly the year 1998 and 1999 show Japan taking over USA. Ukraine and Germany complete the list appearing every year with very close numbers. We see France at the bottom of the list only in the year 1990 and 1991.\nSuch result about Russian Federation and United States is predictable because of the size of the two nations. \nBefore excluding this factor from our next analysis, I think was useful to highlight the relationship between population's growth and suicide number in the top 5 countries.\nAfter calculating the suicide number per 100k population ratio, we observe a completely different scenario, with Brazil and the United Kingdom at the first two position albeit with a huge gap.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to summary](#summary)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

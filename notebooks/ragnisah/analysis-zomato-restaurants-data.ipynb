Hence, it is possible that these customers have not rated the food quality as they would have not got enough experiance to rate the quality.\n    - Rated resturants are in places like canttines, Cinema Complex, Tourist places, Big hotels, etc.\n            - These kinds of locations have mostly a bunch of fixed customers who visit frequently.

Given the following data could help us in better ways to reach to conclusion:\n              - Date of establishment of the resturants: If zero rated resturants are opened long ago and still running. This means people have not rated at all knowingly. zero-rating is a false value here.

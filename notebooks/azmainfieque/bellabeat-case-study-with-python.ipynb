I used *Python* to analyze data and *spreadsheet program (Google Sheets)* to visualize data.\n\n\n### About Bellabeat\nWell, *Urška Sršen* and *Sando Mur* founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.\n*Sršen* used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around\nthe world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with\nknowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n![](https://mk0bellabeatcomhqlip.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bb_31.jpg)\n\n### Business Tasks\nI will try to answer these questions:\n* What are some trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr style=\"height:1px;border-top:2px solid #f00\" />\n\n### Let's play with Data!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Loading all the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T16:35:30.785008Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T16:35:30.785471Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T16:35:30.805561Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T16:35:30.785434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T16:35:30.804754Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Then, storing these datasets into new variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_steps = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv\")\nminute_sleep = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteSleep_merged.csv\")\nheartrate_seconds = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/heartrate_seconds_merged.csv\")\ndaily_intensities = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nsleep_day = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nweightloginfo = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")\ndailyCalories = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T17:09:15.991225Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T17:09:15.991658Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T17:09:18.549175Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T17:09:15.991625Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T17:09:18.548081Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Checking ***daily_activity*** & ***sleep_day***.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.384705Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.385016Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.423257Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.384986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.422011Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sleep_day.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.425305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.425634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.439477Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.425604Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-04T16:35:34.438163Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We're seeing that all the **sleep records** has been recorded at 12:00:00 AM only once per day.

In our ***TotalMinutesAsleep Vs TotalSteps*** Viz, it seems that, women having total steps between 5000-10000 per day, having a good sleep record. Also, walking nearby 10000 steps is a standard for female, recommended by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/postcurriculum_session8.pdf). So, we can convince to the non-user that, to build up her good walking and sleeping habit, bellabeat's product will be good choice.\n* From [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/body-weight-and-cancer-risk/adult-bmi.html)'s website, we know that the ideal BMI range for adult is 18.5-24.9. When BMI is over 24.9, that indicates overweight. In our ***Distance Vs BMI*** Viz, we are seeing that overweight women are more willing to lose their weight by walking more distance. So, women who are  fatty, they can use bellabeat products to be slim with more willing.\n* Suppose anyone want to follow a diet where how much time she should consume at her walking is described. At her fifty minute's walking, her instructor said that she should do more fairly activities. So, she can use bellabeat products to follow instructions as we see at ***Type of Activity*** phase.\n* It's always good to having medium heart rate. When a user do more exercise/activity it'll be bad for her. Also, at sleeping heart rate becomes slow as we see at ***Heart rate Vs Hour*** graph. So, bellabeat products can be good assistant when to sleep or measuring type of activities.\n* It's a good trend to consume calories at week days same as weekend at ***Calories Vs Days*** graph. So, when a user will be so busy in her daily activities, bellabeat products reminder will help her to burn her calory. \n\n### And that's it!","metadata":{}}]}

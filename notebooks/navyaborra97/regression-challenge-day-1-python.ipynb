It differs from correlation analysis because it allows you to predict the outcome for new input or inputs you haven’t seen yet.\n\n**What types of regression are there?**\n\nThere are many different types of regression. The specific family of regressions we’ll be learning are called “generalized linear models”. The important thing for you to know is that with this family of models, you need to pick a specific type of regression you’re interested in. The type of regression will depend on what type of data you’re trying to predict.\n\n* **Linear**: When you’re predicting a continuous value. (What temperature will it be today?)\n* **Logistic**: When you’re predicting which category your observation is in. (Is this is a cat or a dog?)What is regression?\n* **Poisson**: When you’re predicting a count value. (How many dogs will I see in the park?)\n\nToday, we’re going to practice picking the right model for our dataset and plotting it. I will demonstrate first on one dataset, then you'll try your hand at another.\n\n___\n\n<center>\n[**You can check out a video that goes with this notebook by clicking here.**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOj-GJAuvPM)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8c4ebe2f81c2de113e1fab8379bdd86eecad355a","_cell_guid":"afad6981-9dee-4dfd-a41b-f4f6917cde21"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Example: Recipes\n____\n\nFor our example, I'm going be working with a dataset of information on various recipes.

(With your dataset you'll need to come up with your question by picking one variable to predict and one to use to predict it).\n\nIn order to build a model, I need to know what type of variable whether or not a recipe is a dessert is. There are three choices:\n\n* **Continuous**. These are numeric variables that can take any value, including decimals. Examples include temperatures or prices.\n* **Count**. These are numeric variables that can only take positive integer values. Examples include the number of people at a party or the number of cars in a parking lot.\n* **Categorical**. These are not numbers. Categorical variables tell you whether or not an observation is part of a specific group. Good examples include gender or whether someone owns more than ten hats.\n\nThe best way to figure out which one is a variable is is to use your knowledge of a dataset and the world in general. For example, I know that whether or not a recipie is a dessert is a *categorical* variable, while the number of calories in a dessert is probably a *count* variable (unless you have a very, very accurate measure of calories, in which case it might be continuous).\n\nThere are some quick tests you can do to double-check, though.

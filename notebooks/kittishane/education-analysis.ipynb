The quality of education can be measure by the  OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (or PISA) as well as the equality of education. Of course, test score is not the most accurate tool to measure education quality but it is what nearest thing we can probably use. Moreover, PISA examination is said to be the most unbiased exam ever.\n\nThe tools I use in this analysis include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, as well as Google BigQuery.

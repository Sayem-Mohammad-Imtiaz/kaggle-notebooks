The rankings are based on a few important life factors that have been shown to directly impact overall perceived happiness, namely:\n- GDP per capita\n- Social support\n- Healthy life expectancy\n- Freedom\n- Generosity\n- Perceptions of corruption\n\nEach factor is a number between 0 (being the worst) and 10 or 1  (being the best) depending on the factor. Based on these factors, the overall Happiness Score of the country is calculated. Then based on these scores, the countries are ranked in order of their Happiness.\n\nIn this, I will be analysing the World Happiness Report dataset for the year 2019, and then comparing it to the data from 2015 to see what has changed.\n\nDatasets used:\n- [Kaggle - World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preparation and Cleaning\n### Importing important libraries and Loading the datasets\nBefore we start, we need to import all the important libraries that are needed for the analysis.\nWe load the datasets into dataframes using Pandas. `happy_one_df` will contain the data for 2015 and `happy_two_df` will contain the data for 2019."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"happy_one_df = pd.read_csv('../input/world-happiness/2015.csv')\nhappy_two_df = pd.read_csv('../input/world-happiness/2019.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### First look\nNow, let us take a look at the datasets by displaying five rows from each.

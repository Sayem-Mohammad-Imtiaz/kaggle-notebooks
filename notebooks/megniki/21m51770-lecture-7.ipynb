(2011), the earthquake left more than 316,000 people dead or missing and 300,000 injured. Over 300,000 homes collapsed or were critically damaged, and 1.3 million people became homeless. At the time, Haiti ranked 145th out of 169 countries on the UN Human Developement Index, and had little experience of large earthquakes in modern times. As a result, the country was unprepared for the earthquake and the impact was devastating.

We first select a set of relevant features and we analyze their impact in the player salary separatedly. Then, we build a predictive model with those features that have a larger influence on the player salary.\n\nSince for each player we have a wide range of statistics at our disposal, we are going to consider for this analysis only some relevant ones, to avoid multicollinearity in our predictors. Thus, we will take into account the minutes per game (MPG), the points per game (POINTS) and the offensive/defensive real plus-minus values (ORPM and DRPM). Furthermore, we are also analyzing other sort of features such as the player position and some social indicators (Twitter and Wikipedia).\n\nLet's go for it!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import required libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\nfrom scipy.stats import f_oneway\nfrom statsmodels.stats.multicomp import MultiComparison\nfrom statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd\nimport math","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Read the data <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2_read\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_players = pd.read_csv(\"../input/social-power-nba/nba_2017_players_with_salary_wiki_twitter.csv\", index_col=0)\ndf_players.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We run a Quick analysis in search for null or invalid values.\nThere are only few nans in 3 shot % and free throws % and twitter interactions.

Still, there is a lot of room for improvement as, on average, **we are off by more than 4.5M per player**, which is an very important amount of money.\n\nFinally, we are going to examine the regression coefficients as an indicator for the importance of each variable on our model. However, this is only an indicator as we cannot compare these coefficients direclty, since the scale varies largely between the different predictors in our model. In other words, the units in which we measure the twitter interactons have nothing to do with the points per game, which makes it impossible to compare them directly."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(lr_model.coef_)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))\nplt.bar(X.columns, lr_model.coef_, color=(0.8, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8))\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.title('Standardized regression coefs.')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Using a second order linear model <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"10_1_second_order\"></a>\n\nFinally, we study the performance of a second order linear model only to observe how the predictions will improve for the train set, but they degrade considerably when using the same model to infer salaries on the test set."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Relationship is not linear, we use a polynomial regression\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)\nX_ = poly.fit_transform(X)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Separate train and test\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_, Y, test_size=0.20, random_state=42)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lr_model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True, normalize=True)\nlr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\nsc = lr_model.score(X_train, y_train)\nprint('R2 score: %.3f' % sc)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make predictions over train set\ny_pred = lr_model.predict(X_train)\nrmse = math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, y_pred))\nprint('RMSE is %.3f.

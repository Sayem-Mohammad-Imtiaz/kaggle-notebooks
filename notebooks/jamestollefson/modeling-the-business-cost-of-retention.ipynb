The key insight I am pursuing here is the tradeoff between model accuracy and ROI - a more accurate model of attrition does not necessarily lead to a higher return on investment of a firm's retention budget. Understanding this and being able to talk intelligently about it is key to creating workable retention strategies that make the HR function truly strategic.\n\nAs background, there has been a great deal of talk for a couple decades now about the need for HR to be more strategic. Aside from any philosophical discussions of the true nature of 'strategy' and strategic thinking, what this normally means is that business leaders want HR to be more like their marketing departments - analytical, results-oriented, and able to directly tie their activities to the firm's desired outcomes (more money!!). Marketing firms today rely quite heavily on predictive analytics and data mining/data science. The future of HR likely lies along this same road. This kernel explores one potential problem such an analytical 'strategic' HR practicioner might reasonably expect to wrestle with."},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"62c3f0a913d160505891991e1eccc43113837f98","_cell_guid":"0a0b90ff-da53-73f7-8f84-ebff8c67b50d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":1},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"b43f38a8284519c8b9e38b8d7b25ef44bde7b477","_cell_guid":"948b7ce6-373e-b06e-e04d-90d875edbd53"},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv')\ndata.head()","execution_count":2},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"86be69c0974bc440cc8125aa89557877e135ab13","_cell_guid":"f0c82be1-d748-87ac-7f5e-40226074654b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Time to do some EDA!

Something I have noticed with HR datasets is that employee behavior seems to exhibit a fair amount of clustering.\n\nFor the sake of intellectual honesty I'm going to split out my train and test sets before I move forward and apply my transformations to them separately. That will reduce the accuracy of my scores in the end probably, but it more accurately reflects the experience of making actual predictions. After all, if I already know what I'm trying to predict, what's the point of predicting it?"},{"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"98c60c8dc4879597a28248962696be431cd5bb07","_cell_guid":"228556a0-7098-bc0d-774e-b7f32d1e168d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nX = data\ny = data['Attrition']\ndel X['Attrition']\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)\n\n\ncluster = KMeans(n_clusters=80, random_state=42).fit_predict(X_train)\nX_train['cluster'] = cluster\nX_train['cluster'].plot(kind='hist', bins=80)\n_ = plt.xlabel('Cluster')\n_ = plt.ylabel('Count')\n_ = plt.title('Histogram of Clusters')\nplt.show()\n\n_ = plt.scatter(x=X_train['Age'], y=X_train['DailyRate'], c=X_train['cluster'], cmap='Blues')\n_ = sns.kdeplot(data=X_train['Age'], data2=X_train['DailyRate'])\n_ = plt.xlabel('Age')\n_ = plt.ylabel('Daily Rate')\n_ = plt.title('Clusters within Age/Daily Rate')\nplt.show()\n\nx = np.corrcoef(X_train['cluster'], y_train)\nprint(x)","execution_count":17},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ffe4bbee2c35cf8c0e5bf6c32c2d10e2597a4fd5","_cell_guid":"0ea552c9-37a4-a53c-6b14-12256950cd82"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It will be interesting to see if this helps.

Starting from this we hypothesized that there may be a relationship between the answer to the items related well-being and those related to job satisfaction in the [Stackoverflow developer survey 2018 Dataset](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/).\n\n***Analysis***\n*Our Kernel workflow*\n\n*Load dataset:*  Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2018 Dataset on Kaggle.\n*Cleaning data:* convertion of the answers* into numerical values, drop nulls and fillna.\n*Aggregation data:* aggregation of the items into two “TotPoints” one for job satisfaction \nand one for well-being.\n*Normalizing data:* normalization of  “Job Satisfaction TotPoints” and “Well-being TotPoints”.\n*Data visualization:* visuazation on a plot of the two scores.\n*Data correlation:* application of the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficents on the dataframe.\n\n*As a *job satisfaction's* indicators we've considerate the answer to the items \"**JobSatisfaction**\" and \"**CareerSatisfaction**\", instead for *well-being* we've considerate \"**SkipMeals**\", \"**ErgonomicDevices**\", \"**Exercise**\" and \"**HoursOutside**\".\n\n**Conclusion**\n*what we’ve reached so far and a look into the future*\n\nFrom the analyzes made so far, the distribution of the frequencies relative to the total job satisfaction score seems to be asymmetric with the peak on the right, while that of the relative frequencies the well-being total score to take the form of a normal curve. Between the two total scores there isn’t a significant correlation. We will try to apply further statistical analysis techniques to see if the results will change and if there’re gender-based differences. \n\nIn the future, we would like to develop a specif survey to be administred to scholarship students, to explore a possible relation between participation in initiatives such as the \"wellness week\" and course satisfaction.\n**\nTeam “DevsWellbeing”**\n\n@elisaromondia |  @Viola P | @BarbaraC | @Gianni Latorre"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a9a422c169d019f196821499eae256a80c9c0192"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**TODO**\n\n1. trasforming the answer to the item *ErgonomicDevices* in numerical value, +1 for each answer.

I used the Testing Hypothesis ML for UX concept and leveraged supervised learning ML methods to predict the likelihood of a pokemon winning a battle. Using the Scikit-learn algorithm cheat-sheet I can find the most applicable regression model to use,implement the models and compare the predicted results with training data and find the Mean Absolute Error of the predictions.\n\n# Methods\n\nUsing the Scikit-Learn algorithm cheat sheet, I determine that the best ML methods to use for my dataset are Regression models. In this project, I'll explore Simple Linear Regression and SVR to predict Pokemon Win Percentages. \n\n1. Simple Linear Regression\n\nSimple linear regression model is used to show or predict the relationship between two variables. The factor that is being predicted is called the dependent variable. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables. In this simple model, a straight line approximates the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable.\n\n2. SVR Regression \n\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of linear regression that gives us the flexibility to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the data.\n "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis: Data Prep\nSetting up the data to the stage of manipulation that was completed in mini-project 1\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#import files\n#pokemon2 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokemon-index-edited/pokemon2.csv\")\npokemon = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokemon-challenge/pokemon.csv\")\ncombat = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokemon-challenge/combats.csv\")\n#tests = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pokemon-challenge/tests.csv\")\n# rename the column in pokemon data with \"#\" as \"number\" as its name\npokemon = pokemon.rename(index=str, columns={\"#\": \"Number\"})\n# Find total win number\ntotal_Wins = len(combat.Winner.value_counts())\n# get the number of wins for each pokemon\nnumberOfWins = combat.groupby('Winner').count()\ncountByFirst = combat.groupby('Second_pokemon').count()\ncountBySecond = combat.groupby('First_pokemon').count()\n# Finding the total fights of each pokemon\nnumberOfWins['Total Fights'] = countByFirst.Winner + countBySecond.Winner\n# Finding the win percentage of each pokemon\nnumberOfWins['Win Percentage']= numberOfWins.First_pokemon/numberOfWins['Total Fights']\nprint(numberOfWins)\n# Merge the the original pokemon dataset with the winning dataset\nresults2 = pd.merge(pokemon, numberOfWins, right_index = True, left_on='Number')\nresults3 = pd.merge(pokemon, numberOfWins, left_on='Number', right_index = True, how='left')\n\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#plot graph of Speed vs Win Percentage\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nsns.regplot(x=\"Speed\", y=\"Win Percentage\", data=results3, logistic=True).set_title(\"Speed vs Win Percentage\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis: Simple Linear Regression\nBased on what I found in previous my previous project, I know that the Speed of the Pokemon strongly correlations to the Win Percentage.

The Simple Linear Regression method is great when I know the one factor that strongly correlates to the variable I am predicting. With the SVR method, I approached it from a more proper ML way by splitting the dataset into Train Set and Test Set, trained the model, used the model to predict Win Percentages, and then compared the predicted Win Percentages with actual Win Percentages. To determine the accuracy of the results I also calculated the mean absolute error of the results. \n\nTo futher the exploration, I would try more regression methods and compare the mean absolute error results with that of the SVR's to determine if other methods can be more accurate.

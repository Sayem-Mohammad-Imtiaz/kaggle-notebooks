The direction I would take to further this work is to continue with exploratory analysis with the goal of coming up with a win percentage prediction model where I can predict a pokemon's win percentage by finding its stats doppelganger(s). A stretch goal will be to leverage Machine Learning to predict the win percentage. \n\nOverall this project has been fun, though frustrating at times. As a beginner, I wasted alot of time figuring out errors that i realized was caused by not running all code after code changes. I have learned that the nice clean UI of Kaggle that allows breaking code into blocks makes it easy to forget that Python is still being ran in a sequential manner in the backend. Another big challenge is cleaning and setting the dataset up for Kaggle. It took me a significant amount of time to realize that some of the errors i was getting has to do with the structure of the dataset. I had to make sure that even though the dataset looks right in excel, it is properly labelled and structured in Kaggle as well. I eventually found a different dataset to workaround some issues with my previous pokemon dataset. \n\n\nReferences:\nhttp://benalexkeen.com/parallel-coordinates-in-matplotlib/"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

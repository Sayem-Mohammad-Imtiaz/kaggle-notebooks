This is also part 26 of interview with machine learning heroes. In this episode, I\\'m honored to be joined by Abhishek Thakur, chief data scientist at boost.ai, and also the world\\'s first, and at the time of recording, only triple Grand Master on Kaggle. Abhishek has been working as a data scientist for the past few years. He also has a background in computer science with a master\\'s degree from the University of Bonn. We talked about his journey into data science, his Kaggle experience and his current projects. Enjoy the show.\\n\\nSanyam Bhutani  1:38  \\nHi, everyone. Thanks for tuning in.

A joint World Health Organization (WHO)-China fact-finding mission estimated that the epidemic in China peaked between late January and early February 2020. The majority of reports have been from Hubei and surrounding provinces, but numerous cases have been reported in other provinces and municipalities throughout China. \n\n<br>\n<br>\nTo get to know this virus better, I think it's important that we all invest the effort and resources we have. I'm glad to see so many Data Scientists here sharing their visualizations and analysis.</p>\n\n![](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/images/health/1_-conditions/infectious-diseases/coronavirus-hero.ashx?h=500&la=en&mh=500&mw=1300&w=1297&hash=6464CC9E4F6364821A5973E670CFB3342C2D9AF4)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Quick overview of data\n\ndf.describe()\ndf.info()\ndf.isnull().sum()\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.rename(columns={\"SNo\" : \"serial_number\",\n           \"ObservationDate\" : \"observation_date\",\n           \"Province/State\" : \"state\",\n           \"Country/Region\" : \"country\",\n           \"Last Update\" : \"last_update\",\n           \"Confirmed\" : \"confirmed\",\n           \"Deaths\" : \"deaths\",\n           \"Recovered\" : \"recovered\"},\n          inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Grouping confirmed, recovered and death cases per country\ngrouped_country = df.groupby([\"country\"] ,as_index=False)[\"confirmed\",\"recovered\",\"deaths\"].last().sort_values(by=\"confirmed\",ascending=False)\n\n# Using just first 10 countries with most cases\nmost_common_countries = grouped_country.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# FUNCTION TO SHOW ACTUAL VALUES ON BARPLOT\n\ndef show_valushowes_on_bars(axs):\n    def _show_on_single_plot(ax):\n        for p in ax.patches:\n            _x = p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2\n            _y = p.get_y() + p.get_height()\n            value = '{:.2f}'.format(p.get_height())\n            ax.text(_x, _y, value, ha=\"center\")\n\n    if isinstance(axs, np.ndarray):\n        for idx, ax in np.ndenumerate(axs):\n            _show_on_single_plot(ax)\n    else:\n        _show_on_single_plot(axs)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Barplot: confirmed,recovered and death cases per country\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(13,23))\n\n# AXIS 1\nplt.subplot(311)\nvis_1 = sns.barplot(x=\"country\",y=\"confirmed\",data=most_common_countries)\nvis_1.set_title(\"Confirmed cases\")\nshow_valushowes_on_bars(vis_1)\n\n# AXIS 2\nplt.subplot(312)\nvis_2 = sns.barplot(x=\"country\",y=\"recovered\",data=most_common_countries,palette=\"bright\")\nvis_2.set_title(\"Recovered cases\")\nshow_valushowes_on_bars(vis_2)\n\n# AXIS 3\nplt.subplot(313)\nvis_3 = sns.barplot(x=\"country\",y=\"deaths\",data=most_common_countries,palette=\"dark\")\nvis_3.set_title(\"Death cases\")\nshow_valushowes_on_bars(vis_3)\nplt.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig_1 = px.bar(most_common_countries,x=\"country\", y=\"confirmed\",color=\"deaths\",text=\"recovered\",title=\"Countries with most cases.\")\nfig_1.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*As we can see, Italy has the largest increase in confirmed cases.

In this project, we intend to build models to estimate the poverty levels of residents in the regions where Kiva has active loans.\n\nWe analyze correlations between funded amounts and the sector/activity, country and the region's [Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/2019-MPI), a measure of poverty in a region.\n\nWe then predict funded amounts given parameters such as MPI, sector etc and also classify payment interval patterns. We also briefly attempt to analyze the data for bias in lending.\n\n---\n\n## Authors: \n\nIshaan Malhi - UC Berkeley, M.Eng in EECS\n\nZiqian Qin - UC Berkeley, M.Eng. in EECS\n\n---\n\nSubmitted for the fulfillment of the Data 200 Graduate Student Project - \n\nOption 1.

Kiva's mission is \"to expand financial access to help underserved communities thrive.\"\n\n> Kiva **relies on a network of field partners to administer the loans on the ground**. These field partners can be **microfinance institutions, social impact businesses, schools or non-profit organizations**. Kiva includes personal stories of each person who needs a loan so that their lenders can connect with their entrepreneurs on a human level.\n\n<font size=\"1\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiva_(organization)</font>\n\n### 1. Framing the Question\n\n#### Objective\n\nThe dataset obtained is from Kiva.org's [Kaggle Competition in 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding). The aim of the competition was provide Kiva.org with a better understanding of their impact on the localities they serve.\n\nThe original Kaggle competition does not provide any specific prediction problem and leaves the analysis open ended. In this project, we design our own objectives to understand patterns in the microlending space.\n\nSome of our key objectives are:\n\n1. Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns or characteristics in the data to help Kiva.org get insights around lending patterns.\n2. Try to predict the poverty levels of regions given loan amounts and sectors requiring loans.\n3. Predict funded amounts, sectors and poverty levels of an area via supervised learning approaches.\n4. **Explore bias in lending**: We explore if certain parts of society have a higher loan approval rate than others. This is an open ended analysis and our experiments try to show the **negative effects** of machine learning algorithms in a FinTech space if not analyzed for bias.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"colab":{},"colab_type":"code","id":"jZdfVgxJPcTt","scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Import required libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport plotly.offline as pyo\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\npyo.init_notebook_mode()\n\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set()\ntitleid=0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"WCgCgvFa5c3g"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.

When lender counts are >= 200 and < 1200, the regression lines\nshow that men get higher funded amounts. This doesn't give us any strong evidence of algorithmic bias, it just gives\nus some form of loose correlation. \n\n**An important note here is that a machine learning model that predicts funded amount based on other features, that takes the gender column as a feature will fit a curve that will predict a higher funded amount of men for lender counts >= 200 < 1200.** The question of whether to include gender data into a model is thus questionable. A  model can predict higher amounts of women where lender counts <= 200 as well. Moreover, gender could be embedded into the activity column if women perform specific activities that they need funds for. For e.g, in the bar plot above, we see that there are relatively more women in the clothing sector. Does that mean that including a sector information as a feature also introduces bias?\n\nFurther analysis on the region and number of rejected loans would be needed to establish bias.

Conclusion & Future Work\n\n## Summary\n\nWe set out to analyze Kiva.org's lending patterns and understand the distribution of loans across the globe. We analyzed the loan distribution across sectors, countries and activities.\n\nA significant part of the analysis involved seeing the distribution of loans across countries and to find any geographical clustering.\n\nHere are our key findings:\n\n1. Kenya saw a large amount of growth in the initial months of Kiva.org launching (subject to the fact that the dataset is from the time when Kiva.org launched).\n\n2. We see that Agriculture, Food and Retails are the largest sectors that get funded on [Kiva.org](http://kiva.org/)\n\n3. We see certain countries (such as Rwanda) that have a majority of loans under irregular repayment intervals. Irregular payments is a deciding factor of the loan amount.\n\n4. We see that most sectors have a majority repayment interval under monthly payments. \n\n**Interesting Finding**: For sectors like Agriculture where a microloan would be expected to be paid after a long time, or paid irregularly due to the seasonal aspect of Agriculture, especially in developing countries.\n\n5. We see a certain clustering among neighboring countries in terms of funded amounts, thus showing a potential spillover effect.\n\n6. Countries with similar MPI have a large difference between the total funded amount. This is due to weaker peer to peer networks by way of lower number of lenders.\n\n7. We see there is a strong linear correlation between total funded amount and total lender count for nations. Thus lender count is a good predictor of the strength of the microlending network.\n\n**Interesting Finding**: Countries with lower number of lenders also get higher funded amounts. Therefore, a stronger peer to peer microloan network might not mean more lenders, but lenders willing to invest larger amounts of money.\n\n8. We briefly analyze bias to see the distribution of loans for men and women and pose open ended questions for considering bias in machine learning models. We discuss the question of including features if they may contain certain implicit bias.\n\n9. Finally, we do a classification task to classify a loan as 'regular' or 'irregular' payment, as a rough proxy for the likelihood of getting a loan. We use feature engineering techniques such as principal component analysis, one hot encoding and data transformation to clean and transform the data. We then use a logistic regression model to train using cross validation and calculate the confusion matrix using a test subset.\n\nOverall, we go through the entire data science lifecycle in this project and frequently iterate between forming questions, cleaning data, doing EDA and running inference tasks.\n\n## Evaluation of our approach\n\nOur approach involved posing questions, running EDA and drawing inferences based on the EDA. \n\nSince there wasn't a prediction problem setup in the dataset, a large part of our EDA was to understand correlations between features and evaluate which features could be converted to outcome variables such that they gave unique insights. Potentially, another approach could be to draw additional external data to see what loans do not get funded.\n\nOur approach to finding bias in lending was via one specific set of features. Arguably, other features such as the tags assigned to the loan, the payment period etc could also have been used to check for bias.\n\n## Methods we used\n\nIn this project, we used a set of supervised and unsupervised learning models. For supervised methods, we used cross-validation to measure their performance.\n\nModels we used:\n\n1. Linear Regression\n2. Logistic Regression\n3. Random Forest Classifier\n4. Random Forest Regressor\n5. Principle Component Analysis\n\nFor Q1 we used linear regression trying to find the relationship between funded amount and MPI.\n\nFor Q2 we used both linear regression and a random forest regressor. The random forest approach proved to have a better performance.\n\nQ3 is a classification problem so we started from logistic regression. Then we improve the accuracy by applying random forest classifier. We visualized the results by confusion matrices and decision boundaries.\n\nWhen classifying repayment intervals we used PCA to find useful features.\n\n## Limitations\n\n1. The large amount of `null` values of the data posed a problem. We decided to drop the `null` valued data to prevent zero value bias into the EDA. We found setting null values into the dataset actually skewed the metrics on funded amounts quite a bit.\n\n2. Lack of a prediction variable made most of our analysis open ended. We posed questions and ran inferences tasks based on what we thought would be beneficial in a microlending context, however the inference is depdendent on what the microlending company deems important.\n\n3. We were limited by a computational environment and we could not one hot encode all activities due to the feature set reaching very large values. A faster approach to this problem would probably involve using parallel processing libraries on a scalable cluster.\n\n## Future Work\n\nFuture work can involve the following:\n\n1. Analyzing the social bias introduced by including or removing the `gender_borrower` column.\n2. Analyzing the social bias caused by implicit information embedded into features such as `sector` that have a correlation to the gender of the borrower.\n3. Using Neural Networks for classification and regressions tasks with better metric scores.\n4. Using ensemble methods such as Bagging, Boosting for better metric scores.\n5. Exploring hyperparameter search algorithms such as [GridSearch](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) to find the most optimal hyperparameters for a model.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank the Faculty, Staff and Students of CS200 for the opportunity to work on this project as well as their support and feedback.

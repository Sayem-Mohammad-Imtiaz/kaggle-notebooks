However, we know that the calculation is correct  by looking at the final_df above and do some calculation by ourselves. We also went on cardealer websites such as carmax to check if it is possible for cars to have negative inflation rate. Surprisingly, we do find some cars listed on our top-10 rankings usually have a very low depreciation ratio and sometimes negative ratio on Carmax. \n\nThe explaination for the negativce depreciation ratio is the inflation we are experiencing now in the US. Because the microchip industry has been heavily affected by Covid-19 and many factories in worldwide had to shut down, the car industry was also strongly affected because cars need microchip. To avoid waiting a long period time for a car, the consumer demand of cars goes from buying a new car to buying a used car,making the used car market heated in the past year. ","metadata":{}}]}

E.g. Is there a significant trend to travel to certain station at certain time. \n* The number of scooters needed for each station on weekday and weekends.\n* The change in number of scooters after each day of operation at each station. \n\nPossible business insights: \n* The analysis can suggest a reasonable battery capacity of the scooters to the stakeholders.\n* It provides insights on optimizing the allocation of scooters such that the demand can be fulfilled to the best extent.

People travel the most from 7 am to 9 am and from 16 pm to 18 pm in weekdays, while travel the most from 10 am to 18 pm in weekends.  \n* The trips in weekdays morning tend to start from scooter stations near the transit stations, such as 69 and 70, to those stations far away from the transit stops, while the trips in afternoon show a revesed pattern, i.e. from the workplace back to stations near the transit stops.   \n* The analysis calculates the estimated minimal scooters needed for each station in weekdays and weekends seperately. Most the stations need fewer than 30 scooters in weekdays. The demand will become fewer than 10 in weekends.\n* The analysis shows the daily change on the number of scooters at each station. San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th) will have around 20 extra scooters every weekday, which could be re-allocated to other stations. During weekends, the change in the numbers are not that big.

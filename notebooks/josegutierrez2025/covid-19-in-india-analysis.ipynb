I learned how to import a dataset on a Kaggle notebook. After importing the dataset, I learned how to analyze it. I was able to display the dataset to see all the different rows, columns, and values. I learned how to pull the data out in order to perform a specific task. \n   \n   I learned how to use matplotlib, pandas, and numpy to graph a dataset. I was able to interpret the data I had previously pulled out. I learned how to use numpy to fix the issues with my coding. With this data, I was able to make bar and line plot graphs out of it. I learned how to label, title, and display the graphs. \n   \n   This coding experience has taught me a lot about the topic. I learned that coding takes a lot of time to understand. There are many instances where you will try to get a result you want, but it will constantly say \"error\". For me, this learning process was all about trial and error and understanding the values, variables, functions, arguements, and strings I am typing. However, when it clicks and the code works, it is one of the best feelings in the world as you get to see the process it took and how you learned to perform a specific task you wanted to be done.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

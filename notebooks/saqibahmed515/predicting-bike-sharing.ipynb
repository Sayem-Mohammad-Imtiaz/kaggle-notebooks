The hidden layer will use the sigmoid function ($f(x)=1/(1+e^{-x})$) for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation function is $f(x)=x$. A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs to the neurons on the next layer. This process is called *forward propagation*.\n\nWe use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural network.

If you train the network too long or have too many hidden nodes, it can become overly specific to the training set and will fail to generalize to the validation set. That is, the loss on the validation set will start increasing as the training set loss drops.\n\nWe've also been using a method known as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network. The idea is that for each training pass, you grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set. You use many more training passes than with normal gradient descent, but each pass is much faster. This ends up training the network more efficiently.\n\n### The number of iterations\nThis is the number of batches of samples from the training data we'll use to train the network. The more iterations you use, the better the model will fit the data. However, this process can have sharply diminishing returns and can waste computational resources if you use too many iterations.  You want to find a number here where the network has a low training loss, and the validation loss is at a minimum. The ideal number of iterations would be a level that stops shortly after the validation loss is no longer decreasing.\n\n### The learning rate\nThis scales the size of weight updates. If this is too big, the weights tend to explode and the network fails to fit the data. Normally a good choice to start at is 0.1; however, if you effectively divide the learning rate by n_records, try starting out with a learning rate of 1. In either case, if the network has problems fitting the data, try reducing the learning rate. Note that the lower the learning rate, the smaller the steps are in the weight updates and the longer it takes for the neural network to converge.\n\n### The number of hidden nodes\nIn a model where all the weights are optimized, the more hidden nodes you have, the more accurate the predictions of the model will be.  (A fully optimized model could have weights of zero, after all.) However, the more hidden nodes you have, the harder it will be to optimize the weights of the model, and the more likely it will be that suboptimal weights will lead to overfitting. With overfitting, the model will memorize the training data instead of learning the true pattern, and won't generalize well to unseen data.  \n\nTry a few different numbers and see how it affects the performance. You can look at the losses dictionary for a metric of the network performance. If the number of hidden units is too low, then the model won't have enough space to learn and if it is too high there are too many options for the direction that the learning can take. The trick here is to find the right balance in number of hidden units you choose.  You'll generally find that the best number of hidden nodes to use ends up being between the number of input and output nodes."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\n\nN_i = train_features.shape[1]\nnetwork = NeuralNetwork(N_i, hidden_nodes, output_nodes, learning_rate)\n\nlosses = {'train':[], 'validation':[]}\nfor ii in range(iterations):\n    # Go through a random batch of 128 records from the training data set\n    batch = np.random.choice(train_features.index, size=128)\n    X, y = train_features.iloc[batch].values, train_targets.iloc[batch]['cnt']\n                             \n    network.train(X, y)\n    \n    # Printing out the training progress\n    train_loss = MSE(network.run(train_features).T, train_targets['cnt'].values)\n    val_loss = MSE(network.run(val_features).T, val_targets['cnt'].values)\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\rProgress: {:2.1f}\".format(100 * ii/float(iterations)) \\\n                     + \"% ...

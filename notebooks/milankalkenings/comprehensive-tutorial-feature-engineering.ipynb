Motivation and General Advices</h1>\n\nReworking features to uncover **key relationships** between features and outcome is called **Feature Engineering**. It might be helpful to have some domain knowledge in order to understand the data best.\n\nFeature Engineering relies on the resulting insights of [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis).\nThe combination of Feature Engineering and EDA occurs in different phases of the whole modeling process, e.g. during post-modeling, based on Residual Analysis. **Residual Analysis** is the process of analyzing which feature values lead to false predictions.\n\n\n### Key relationships may be between the outcome and\n* a transformation of a feature / different representation of a feature\n* a functional relationship between features e.g. product or ratio of multiple features \n\n\n### Feature Engineering helps us to obtain a good trade-off between:\n* accuracy\n* simplicity\n* robustness\n\n### A good Mindset for Feature Engineering leads to:\n* Simplifying relationships with the target to either **binary flags** or **monotonic functions, linear if possible**.\n* Treating each transformation as one element in your ensembled machine learning model (just like in  [Pipelining](https://www.kaggle.com/milankalkenings/no-pipelines-you-are-probably-doing-it-wrong))","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"sec11\"></a>\n***\n<h1 style=\"background-color:DodgerBlue; color:white\" >-> 1.1. Feature-Target Relations and Monotony</h1>\n\nAs mentioned above, it is best practice to create features which have a **monotonic relationship** with the target. This is due to:\n\n* The relationship is easy to interpret for Data Analysts\n* Machine Learning algorithms might converge faster\n* Machine Learning algorithms in most cases provide better predictions with features like these\n\n\n\n\nBut what exactly are these monotonic relationships? Let me give you an example:\nImagine having data about some employees of your department, and you want to find out the relationship between years of deployment (*years*) and the *salary* of the employees.

Combine Features </h1>\n\nMany machine learning algorithms utilize feature interactions and combinations implicitly. However, experience has shown that it still might be a good idea to combine features manually, because we can't rely on our model 'doing all the work'.\n\n\nFinding and combining features could be important for standing out in Kaggle competitions, but finding useful combinations might be a non-trivial problem. Suggestions from **domain experts** are oftentimes the best entry point to detecting valuable combinations.\n\nBesides relying on domain experts, we could try every possible combination of features to identify *predictive* (i.e. model improving) ones. This approach would take too much time, but at least we can already find many of the most important combinations if we follow these guidelines: \n* **effect sparsity:** the fewer features are part of the combination, the higher the chance for the combination to be predictive (including singletons, i.e. uncombined features). We should focus on combinations between 2 or 3 features.\n* **heredity:** the combination $(feat_1, feat_2)$ should only be considered to be predictive, if at least one of the features, $feat_1$ or $feat_2$, is already known to be predictive.[$^{1}$](#note)\n* **priority:** in most cases, the interpretability and the predictivity of a combination is better when the original features aren't transformed ([scaled](#sec21), encoded, [log-transformed](#log)...).

Combine Features using Equations</h1>\n\n\nThere are multiple ways of combining features as introduced in [this video from Jeff Heaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4pWmkxEikM). Combining features demands you to wrap your mind around the given data and to think of new features you could create by combining the given ones. A combination can be seen as a formula/equation for a new feature.\n\nProbably the most common, and most interpretable **building blocks** of these equations are:\n\n* Products of numerical features (E.g. daily cigarettes ⋅ days or area = width ⋅ length)\n* Ratios of numerical features (E.g. $\\frac{price}{gram}$)\n* Sums of numerical features (E.g. weight of passengers + weight of the transported goods)\n* Differences of numerical values (E.g. workdays - sick days). One often uses differences to subtract means\n\nThe whole equation for a new feature parent\nthat describes the likelihood of an employee going on parental leave (*parent*), given the numerical features age, and the years of employment (*empl*), as well as the binary categorical features *sex* (female), and the marital status (*married*) could look like this:\n\n$\\large\n     \\text{parent} =C (1+0.7married)(\\frac{empl}{age^5}+0.5\\frac{empl}{age^5}) \n$\n\nTake a moment to think about the way the binary categorical features affect this equation.\n\nLet's apply this equation to some data to see if it works:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"married = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\nempl = [2, 5, 4, 15, 2, 6, 1]\nage = [25, 27, 41, 43, 28, 29, 22]\nfemale = [0, 1,  1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\nvalues = list(zip(married, empl, age, female))\nnames = ['married', 'empl', 'age', 'female']\ndf = pd.DataFrame(values, columns=names)\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.58756Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.587989Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.610003Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.587928Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.608886Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"c = 10_000_000 # a constant for better readability\n\ndef parent(row):\n    return  c * (1 + 0.5*row['married'])*(row['empl']/(row['age']**5) + 0.5*row['female']*row['empl']/(row['age']**5))\n    \n\n    \nparent = df.apply(parent, axis=1) # axis=1 for row-wise operation\ndf_with_parent = pd.concat([df, parent.rename('parent')], axis=1)\ndf_with_parent","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.611859Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.61243Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.637396Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.612384Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-09T08:52:09.635967Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, young people who are employed for several years are very likely to go on parental leave.

This method is especially important if your project demands you to focus on a particular subgroup of our observations, or when you already figured out any frequent sets in your Dataset.\n\n* Use this method for commonly fulfilled conditions \n* The conditions should contain multiple features, to evade *collinearity*\n* Construct the condition based on your project goals or frequent patterns in your data\n* You can find frequent patterns in your data using the [Apriori Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guVvtZ7ZClw)\n\n\nImagine your Data Exploration reveals the fact that a particular combination of features occurs frequently with a particular outcome. In such a case, it might be interesting to create a *binary flag*, indicating the particular combination. Of course, the algorithm could find out this relationship automatically, but we can never be sure about it. \n\nFor example, we could have found out, that all young customers, who already bought multiple products from our company are very interested in our new product. Let's call these young people *young fans*.

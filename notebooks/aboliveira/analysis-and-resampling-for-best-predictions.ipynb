Most choose the fiber optic internet service, with no online security, no online backup, no device protection, and no tech support. They also seem to mostly not have a partner or dependents.\n\n#### Potential Problems:\n- It is possible that there is a problem with the fiber optic internet service, as it has the highest churn rate of the internet services provided.

It combines an **initial keyword search** with a recommendation system, so you can first make a precise query to find exactly what you are looking for and then click on a result to find further **related research** to widen your scope. Since it's based on latent relationships within the whole dataset, this can help to spark new insights! \n\nIt was built on the basis of several of my notebooks. Here a quick overview of what happens in each one of them (for detailed information and reproducible code have a look inside):\n\n[Data preparation](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/cord-19-create-dataframe):\n* data loading, cleaning and merging\n* identification of the methods section of each paper and **extraction of study design**\n* **language detection** to remove non-english articles (they would cause noise in our topic model)\n* export as one clean dataframe\n\n    \n\n[Whoosh Search](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/whoosh-search):\n* [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) is a fast, pure Python search engine library. It allows you to build a customized search engine that uses the **Okapi BM25F** ranking function\n* we implement a **customized tokenizer** for the use of [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) to better handle **biomedical, scientific and clinical vocabulary**\n* allows **boolean queries** (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) and **phrase queries** with double quotes\n* **search specific fields** (abstract, authors, doi, methods, ...), for example: \n    * journal:(Studies in Natural Products Chemistry)\n    * authors:drosten\n    * doi:10.1101/2020.01.31.929042\n    * title:hydroxychloroquine AND methods:(randomized controlled trial)\n\n[Topic Model](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/topic-modeling-finding-related-articles):\n* [scispacy](https://allenai.github.io/scispacy/) for biomedical, scientific and clinical vocabulary\n* lemmatization and stop word removal to improve **text quality**\n* **bigrams and trigrams** to consider word pairs and triples (such as 'infectious disease' or 'public health')\n* Latend Dirichlet Allocation for **unsupervised discovery of 50 fine-grained topics** (to find latent relationships in the corpus)\n* view each paper as a mixture of topics to find related articles that have a similar topic-mixture"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Topic Model"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.core.display import HTML\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To learn the latent topics in an unsupervised fashion we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This is generative statistical model which assumes that each document is a mixture of a given number of topics. Here, **a topic is a distribution over words**.\n\nFor our approach, we set the number of topics to 50. As the following plot shows, we get very **fine-grained topics that still seem meaningful and don't have too much overlap**. In our case, overlap isn't a big problem either, because we are not trying to assign one specific topic to each paper, but rather a mixture of topics. \nTo compute the distance between papers we use the **Jensen-Shannon divergence** of their topic distributions. This distance can then be interpreted as a measure for **topic-wise similarity** to find related articles.\n\n*If the plot is cut, you can download the HTML [here](https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/discovid-files)*."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"IFrame(src='https://dwolffram.github.io/cord19_lda_topics/', width=850, height=900)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# HTML(filename='../input/discovid-files/lda_topics.html') # this causes display issues","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before removing the non-English articles, interestingly, the following topics had been discovered:\n\nTopic #46: der die und bei mit von eine ist werden zu für sind oder einer des den nicht das als nach zur auf durch auch ein <br />\nTopic #40: de les des en une est dans du par un ou sont pour plus au que avec chez sur d'une qui cas être pas ces <br />\nTopic #32: de en el los que se con las por un es para pacientes como más virus son tratamiento su infección puede ha casos enfermedad entre <br />\nTopic #7: un che con sono nel alla più ha tra gli degli come rischio ed pazienti nella nei osteonecrosis ad essere stato studio salute anche have <br />\n\nAs you can see, there was one for German, French, Spanish and Italian.

At the end of the day, we need robust and reliable results and not an unverifiable output from a blackbox model, that might or might not be true. The risk of missing the context or the assumptions made in a paper, by reducing it to some keyphrases or extracted numbers, seems too high at this stage, that's why we leave further conclusions up to domain experts.

If the HR dept is unable to do so,\n\n- The former employeesâ€™ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners\n\n- A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent\n\n- More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatise themselves to the company\n\nA large company named XYZ, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market.\n\nThe management of the company has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.\n\nPlaying the role of a Lead Data Analyst in the firm, this project has been assigned to me.\nJoin me as I tread on this journey of exploration and attempt to figure out the main causes behind the attrition rate of company XYZ.\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Patch\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the Employee Survey Data \ndf1=pd.read_csv('../input/employee_survey_data.csv')\nprint(df1.columns)\ndf1.head()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the Employee General Data \ndf2=pd.read_csv('../input/general_data.csv')\nprint(df2.columns)\ndf2.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing the Manager Survey Data\ndf3=pd.read_csv('../input/manager_survey_data.csv')\nprint(df3.columns)\ndf3.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=df1.merge(df2,on='EmployeeID',how='inner')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Creating a master dataset by merging all 3 datasets\ndf=df.merge(df3,on='EmployeeID',how='inner')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"skip"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Finding out about the data types and null values present in the dataset across columns\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"slideshow":{"slide_type":"slide"}},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We know that the average number of employees at XYZ are approximately 4000.

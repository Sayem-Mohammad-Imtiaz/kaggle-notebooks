To figure this out we figure out the average amount of sales of each video game that have a certain trait. We tested five variables - critic score, user score, genre, platform, and ESRB rating. We believed that the a high quality (high user and critic score), E-rated, role-playing, PC game would be the best combination but from our analysis we discovered that a high quality, M-rated, platforming, PS4 game had the most average sales per game.

During our years of video game experience, both highly anticipated and barely advertised video games have reached the top of the selling charts. So, what makes the most profitable video game? \n\nOthers have hypothesized and tried to prove their hypothesis with reasoning (see \"Recipe for Creating the Best Selling Video Games - EXPOSED\"), but I have not seen a report using big data to prove these hypotheses. There was a similar report using this data set (see \"Video games sales vs ratings and critic biases\") but it only focused on the rating aspect of video games and we would like to explore as many of these characteristics as possible. These top selling games varied in many ways - genre, quality, rating, platform availability, pricing, etc - and we are wondering which combination of these factors would make for the highest selling game. \n\nThe data set used in this report only had five variables we could test to see if it contributed to the video game's sales - ESRB rating, genre, platform, critic score, and user score. We hypothesize that the golden combination would be an E-rated game in the role-playing genre available on the PC with high critic and user scores. An E-rated game would have the highest audience availability and most likely appeal to people of all ages. A game in the role-playing genre would allow players to try play the game as if it were real or fill a fantasy and role play as a hero. Essentially, a role-playing game would be best selling because your personality and choice affects the game which would attract a lot of sales and players. We believe the PC would be the highest selling platform because although everyone may not have a console, most households have computers so you would have more overall sales. Finally, critic score and user score should be higher for high selling games as a higher quality game would get more sales purely by reputation."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e55728c-5b52-cb41-38a0-05ec096996b1","_uuid":"1f5a9390d9fae2c54160d5f42e3d26722e052b17"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Data ##\nThe data set I will be using is \"Video Game Sales and Ratings.\" This data was collected by a \"...web scrape from VGChartz and Metacritic along with manually entered year of release values for most games with a missing year of release\" (Video Games Sales and Ratings) and then put into a CSV file which makes the data easy to read and to utilize."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fcbf09ba-c899-7d23-1831-339b0e8c89ac","_uuid":"9b63985589bd1cdc06da5522302f4ef3f9142776"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Modules ##\n\n - csv: type of file we are reading\n - pandas: puts the data in a dictionary structure that is easy to work with\n - matplotlib: plotting library that is essential for most other plotting module\n - seaborn: easy to use plotting module"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d41b874e-516c-0626-dd6a-1edb60f58b8f","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false,"_uuid":"103e59a1d2f0a79aa9116ab4449fd8e5d82d60c4","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import csv\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sb\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"328e6745-d2e5-80a1-7c1c-f81f3546edd7","_uuid":"38f3c8edb68cbe0aff435c8154b0434d1685c5c6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analysis ##\n\nHere we read the csv data set and convert it into a pandas data frame which will make the data easier to work with"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ee9fa878-607b-4536-ddce-55d3487ca717","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false,"_uuid":"b4cce4863c05092ab1ac3f856e2051ea511daed3","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reader = pd.read_csv('../input/Video_Game_Sales_as_of_Jan_2017.csv')\ngameData = pd.DataFrame(reader)\ngameData","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"270bf1fe-91b7-1b2d-a48a-a25908665790","_uuid":"06c0a0aa621c81f5605e9699527ae6c2099e7ee7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we want to see if there is a relationship between critic score/user score and global sales to see if quality games actually do sell more so we create a scatter plot comparing critic score to global sales and figure out the correlation value."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4b22dfec-8f88-369b-061e-3fa8ad40ab88","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":false,"_uuid":"df1ecb559f5eecc83a2129eb47440b615704260f","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\nplt.plot(gameData['Critic_Score'], gameData['Global_Sales'], '.', alpha = 0.5)\nplt.xlabel('Critic Score')\nplt.ylabel('Gloabl Sales')\nplt.title('Does Critic Score affect Global Sales?')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9f729f8b-6cce-926b-c3c2-2ef5f82a8266","_uuid":"47856965a46f092155e9d9e7a9cf7c03e22e84de"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As predicted, higher critic scores generally lead to higher sales.

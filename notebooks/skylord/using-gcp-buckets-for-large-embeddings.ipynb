From there you can access your data via the following two methods. \n\n1. Access data via the client storage API \n2. Data is publicly available  - anyone with the link can access the data\n\n+++++++++++++  ***Note***  +++++++++++++\n\nAs per the tasks submission guidelines: To be valid, a submission must be contained in a single notebook made public on or before the submission deadline. Participants are free to use additional datasets in addition to the official Kaggle dataset, but those datasets must also be publicly available on either Kaggle, Allen.ai, or Semantic Scholar in order for the submission to be valid. Participants must also accept the competition rules.\nSource: [Tasks description](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks?taskId=568)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

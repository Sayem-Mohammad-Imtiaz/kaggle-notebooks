Conclusion\n\nBetting on either the Colts or the Bengals when they are favored would be a losing proposition, becuase neither of these teams have covered in more than half of such games.  This seems to be even more true for the lowly Bengals.  The Colts have covered in 48% of all games that they have been favored in, while the Bengals have only covered 46% of games they have been favored in.\n\nOver the past 5 years, the Bengals have had a rough stretch.  They have not had a single winning season while losing by an average of almost 5 points a game (including losing by an average of 6.58 points a game on the road).  \n\nThe Colts have been relatively decent over the past 5 years, posting 2 winning seasons and one 8-8 season.  Over the same 5 year time frame they have been winning games by an average of 0.5 points per game.","metadata":{}}]}

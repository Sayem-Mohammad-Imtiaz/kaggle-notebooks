Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations.\nIn 2015 there are lots of flight delays in United States for some reason. Nearly one third of all flights in our data set have delays.\n\nThe main reasons for flight delays are wheather related but in some cases there are also airline or airport related flight delays. This document examines and shows the delay and cancellation causes in several aspects.\n\nI have come up with tableau data visualisation to show case the delay of flights using 366,000 observations of the dataset and provide a holistic destination map data visualisation in tableau.    \n\nPlease feel free to play around with different flight combinations to observe the visualisations\n\nThe following visualisations comprises of \n\n#### 1.

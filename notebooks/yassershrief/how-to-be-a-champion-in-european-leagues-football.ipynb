It considers several factors including the type of pass, pass end-point and length of the pass.\n\nExpected Points (xPTS) - measures the likelihood of a certaing game to bring points to the team.\n\nThese metrics let us look much deeper into football statistics and understand performance of players and teams in general and realize the role of luck and skill in it.

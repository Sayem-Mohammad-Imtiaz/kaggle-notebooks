For this reason, we will use accuracy and recall scores to evaluate our model performance.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load Classification Packages and Accuracy Packages for the analysis","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas_profiling as pf\npd.set_option('display.max_column', 60)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, recall_score, precision_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\nprint('complete')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/churn-in-telecoms-dataset/bigml_59c28831336c6604c800002a.csv')\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking the dimension of the dataset\nrows, cols = data.shape\nprint(f'The number of rows in our dataset are {rows} \\nWhile the number of columns are {cols}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# display the columns\ndata.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"let's replace empty space in our columns with underscore ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# replace space in the columns with underscore\ndata.columns = data.columns.str.replace(' ', '_')\ndata.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# descriptive statistics\ndata.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.select_dtypes('number').head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets chech how these attributes correlated to our target variable\ndata.corr()['churn']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lets visualiza our target variable\nchurn = data['churn'].value_counts()\nsns.barplot(churn.index, churn.values)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we can see that the number of custumners that leaved were lesser than customers that stay","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Dealing with Categorical columns**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# dealing with categorical columns \ndata.select_dtypes('object').head(4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nyou may have noticed from the above data(info), that we have 4 object types, and 3 of these object types are useful for our analysis.

Any reason is a serious cry for help and is conveyed in silence most of the times. Anxiety, depression, domestic violence, hopelessness, poverty, oppression, disappointment are just very few reasons for people to resort to such drastic measures. Not every time people suffereing have the courage or the drive to speak up about it neither with their friends nor families. When you see someone that is definitely not in their right mental health, the best and the most basic thing we can do as humans is to talk to them and encourage them with a positive attitude to address it. Different types of mental health treatments can help cope with different mental illness. \n    \n    With the dataset provided by WHO, it is shocking to realize that people attempting suicide spans across every age group starting from as young as 5 year olds. \n    \n    The main goal of this data visualization is to identify the contries that really need to put together mental health awarenes campaigns to better serve their citizens.

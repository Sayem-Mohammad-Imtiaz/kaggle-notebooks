The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.\n\nThe term “linearity” in algebra refers to a linear relationship between two or more variables. If we draw this relationship in a two-dimensional space (between two variables), we get a straight line.\n\nLinear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value **(y)** based on a given independent variable **(x)**. So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between **x (input)** and **y(output)**. Hence, the name is Linear Regression. If we plot the independent variable **(x)** on the x-axis and dependent variable **(y)** on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line that best fits the data points, as shown in the figure below.\n\nWe know that the equation of a straight line is basically:\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**The equation of the above line is :**\n\n### Y= mx +

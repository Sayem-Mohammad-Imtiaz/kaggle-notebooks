Conclusion"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Using this data we were able to answer some basic questions on the customers and why the leave the company.\n\n- We saw that customers who use the `Fiber optic` service are very likely to churn the company, this is very important insight, as it should be understood the reason behind this, maybe there are competing companies which provide the same service but with better offers.\n\n- We also saw how the churn rate changes for different customer tenure, new customers find very different companies to choose from, and therefore, the company should invest a lot in keeping these customers, and making sure they turn into loyal customers.\n\n- With this data alone, it would be hard to actually understand what the customers like, and how to make sure they don't churn. Some important information is needed in this context, such as:\n    - Service price information.\n    - Time series data for customer's monthly charges, since they signed a contract with the company.\n    - Other competing companies services information."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

It corresponds to the months of Fall. The presence of a large number of dried leaves probably aid in spread the forest fires. An analysis of the weather data during this period can indicate if weather conditions have a role to play in this.\n- The state of Mato Grosso has the most number of forest fires. Amazon comes 10th in the list. \n- Even after so much talk about forest fires, there is no decreasing trend in the forest fires in any states."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

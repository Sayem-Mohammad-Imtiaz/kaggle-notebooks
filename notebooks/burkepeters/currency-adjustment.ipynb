By translating all of the indexes to a common currency, it would be easier to compare them.\n\nThe basic task is to translate all indexes to a common currency and the example is given with USD. \n\nFor example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HSI) is quoted in HKD, so our basic DataFrame will contain OHLC prices in HKD while our processed DataFrame will also include a translation to USD. \n\nThere is no way to find the exchange rates from the basic DataFrame alone without pulling in external data in some form. This could be done easily enough by incorporating even a single point in time exchange rate and back-filling (as the author of the processed DataFrame has done). \n\nHowever, we may want to compare index prices in terms of a currency other than USD. This can easily be done if we know at least one other exchange rate, in this case their exchange rates against the USD.\n\nWe are not given the bid and ask, so we will assume the prices given are the midpoint (or one or the other, as long as it is consistent). \n\nFor example, we can use the two quotes CAD/USD and USD/HKD to calculate the market-implied quote on the CAD/HKD cross rate. \n\nBegin by considering the transactions required to sell CAD and buy HKD, going through the CAD/USD and USD/HKD currency pairs. \n\nWe can view this process intuitively as:\n\n(Sell CAD, Buy HKD) = (Sell CAD, Buy USD) + (Sell USD, Buy HKD)\n\nNote that the \"Buy USD\" and \"Sell USD\" in the expressions on the right-hand side of the equal sign will cancel out to give the CAD/HKD cross rate. \n\nIn equation form, we can represent this relationship as follows: \n\n$$(\\frac{CAD}{HKD}) = (\\frac{CAD}{USD})(\\frac{USD}{HKD})$$\n\nNow, let's incorporate the bid-offer rates in order to do the CAD/HKD calculation. \n\nA rule of thumb is that when we speak of a bid or offer exchange rate, we are referring to the bid or offer for the currency in the denominator (the base currency). \n\nSo, in the above equation, we are looking to \"Buy HKD\" in the denominator, so we are looking for an **offer** rate, thus we will be calculating the offer rate for CAD/HKD. \n\nNext, we look at the first term on the right side of the equation, we are going to \"Buy USD\", so again, we need the offer rate but this time for CAD/USD. \n\nFinally, when we look at the second term on the right side of the equation, we get \"Buy HKD\" in the denominator, so again, we need the offer rate but this time for USD/HKD. \n\nThis is all to say that when we are calculating these rates, if we are looking to buy or sell, they simply need to all be the offer or bid rates. \n\n**CONVERSION**: Depending on the quotes provided, it may be necessary to invert one of the quotes in order to complete the calculation. \n\nConsider the case of calculating the implied GBP/EUR cross rate if you are given USD/GBP and USD/EUR quotes. \n\nSimply using the provided quotes will not generate the desired GBP/EUR cross rate. \n\nInstead, because the USD is in the numerator in both currency pairs, we will have to invert one of the pairs to derive the GBP/EUR cross rate. \n\nWe can invert the USD/GBP quote and use that in our calculation instead.

thats all for now. Im trying to undestand how to apply these algorithims. But in resume:\n    \n    Random Forest performed better than decision tree...at the moment, i cant explain much why this occur, but i will keep learning...\n    \n    Plese, leave your comments, i'll be so glad if someone can explain to me how my model performed ! \n    \n    Thank you !

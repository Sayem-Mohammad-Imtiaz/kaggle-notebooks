Looks like we finally see an increase in performance. This was somehow expected, since 11 features was quite a low number to begin with, and 78 (and 170) features have the potential of giving us much more information. There is however something slightly controversial: when using a degree of 2, the non-regularised model surprisingly outperforms the regularised ones, but this is not the case when using a degree of 3. A possible explanation could be that the simple regression using degree 2 features does not suffer from overfitting yet (and therefore regularisation is neither necessary nor advised), while when using degree 3 features, the simple model actually begins to overfit, and regularisation starts doing a better job. This would also explain the poor performance of the non-regularised linear regression on the set with degree 3 features.\n\nAnother interesting observation is that Ridge is the best of the regularised regressions in both degree 2 and 3. This is probably because, as we saw earlier, there is some multicollinearity between several of the features. Applying a polynomial transformation does not change this (in fact, if anything, it would worsen it), and one of the main advantages of the L2 penalty is, precisely, that it helps address multicollinearity."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a2b8be52ce24cf31c541a35674ad398eb6c2c2a1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Support Vector Machines (SVM)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe4d7d95bc9714827f876992362c5c69c9cd70d4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A _Support Vector Machine (SVM)_ aims to maximize the margin between data points and a separating hyperplane.

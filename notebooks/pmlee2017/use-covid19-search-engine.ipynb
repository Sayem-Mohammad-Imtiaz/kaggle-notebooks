We have performed clustering on the datapoints and have used PCA to reduce the number of dimensions and visualize them in three dimensions. With word cloud, we have been able to get an idea of the topic of each cluster. And finally, we build a demo to test out two settings, one with the embeddings on title only and the other one on both title and abstract.\n\nWe have observed some differences while comparing the returned results between using only title and both title and abstract. From the point of view of a search engine, users often only use several keywords as queries, hence it is more reasonable to compare with embeddings infered from only title because they are also short and precise. On the other hand, the embeddings with title and abstract have proven to be useful in clustering because they contain more information.\n\nThe takeaway message here is that embeddings with title are useful for query searching, and embeddings with title and abstract are useful for clustering.\n\n# Next steps\n\nFrom this study, while embeddings using USE have been able to recommend some relevant articles for the input queries, there is still room for improvement as we have seen that the confidence of the model given by the similarity score is not exceptional, we will proceed by fine tuning the USE model on the CORD19 research challenge corpus, and as a comparison we will carry out the same task with the BioBERT model.

With these 2 graphs I can clearly see the year when most movies were made and the exact same thing but with TV Shows.\n#\nI can also answer the question I made above which says \"How Many More Movies Are Released In The Past 20 Years And Is It More Then How Many TV Shows Are Released?\" The answer is that there are more Movies in the span of 20 years than there are of TV Shows. It isn't very clear if you look at them from far away but if you look at the y section in both datas you will see that in the movies data the maximum amount of movies created is 700 whilst the TV Shows only show 400 as their maximum.

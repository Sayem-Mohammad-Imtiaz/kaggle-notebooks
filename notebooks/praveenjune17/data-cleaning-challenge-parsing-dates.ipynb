Today, we're going to work with dates. To get started, click the blue \"Fork Notebook\" button in the upper, right hand corner. This will create a private copy of this notebook that you can edit and play with. Once you're finished with the exercises, you can choose to make your notebook public to share with others. :)\n\n> **Your turn!** As we work through this notebook, you'll see some notebook cells (a block of either code or text) that has \"Your Turn!\" written in it. These are exercises for you to do to help cement your understanding of the concepts we're talking about. Once you've written the code to answer a specific question, you can run the code by clicking inside the cell (box with code in it) with the code you want to run and then hit CTRL + ENTER (CMD + ENTER on a Mac). You can also click in a cell and then click on the right \"play\" arrow to the left of the code. If you want to run all the code in your notebook, you can use the double, \"fast forward\" arrows at the bottom of the notebook editor.\n\nHere's what we're going to do today:\n\n* [Get our environment set up](#Get-our-environment-set-up)\n* [Check the data type of our date column](#Check-the-data-type-of-our-date-column)\n* [Convert our date columns to datetime](#Convert-our-date-columns-to-datetime)\n* [Select just the day of the month from our column](#Select-just-the-day-of-the-month-from-our-column)\n* [Plot the day of the month to check the date parsing](#Plot-the-day-of-the-month-to-the-date-parsing)\n\nLet's get started!"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5cd5061f-ae30-4837-a53b-690ffd5c5830","_uuid":"9d82bf13584b8e682962fbb96131f2447d741679"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Get our environment set up\n________\n\nThe first thing we'll need to do is load in the libraries and datasets we'll be using.

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also lets you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# More practice!\n___\n\nIf you're interested in graphing time series, [check out this Learn tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/time-series-plotting-optional).\n\nYou can also look into passing columns that you know have dates in them to the `parse_dates` argument in `read_csv`. (The documention [is here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html).) Do note that this method can be very slow, but depending on your needs it may sometimes be handy to use.\n\nFor an extra challenge, you can try try parsing the column `Last Known Eruption` from the `volcanos` dataframe. This column contains a mixture of text (\"Unknown\") and years both before the common era (BCE, also known as BC) and in the common era (CE, also known as AD)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e88be9c-982c-43c2-8169-ba9ae5e8a8df","_uuid":"b647eb891e9818d466b484e45e00f9d95ce585b4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"volcanos['Last Known Eruption'].sample(5)","execution_count":38,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4757793a9bfc43de3b06706f9c11785c48a249c4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Check if a digit in present in the string if it is then split the string by a single space and return the year else return unknow\nvolcanos['Last Known Eruption year'] = volcanos['Last Known Eruption'].apply(lambda x : x.split()[0] if any([i.isdigit() for i in x]) else 'Unknown')","execution_count":65,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"ec01125ee52f35c01d720d9c02fa91bde0f08a66"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0070bd67001f591a59f3d7bf5dece976bc7ae7dd"},"cell_type":"code","source":"volcanos['Last Known Eruption year']","execution_count":67,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"9c3eed7f43a5f7fe312ca30ac0133c52083aec95"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"a8874df64ba1637fd089cbbd0d98f20efd5a2c96"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"ce66a59382ee34d7c58ebd7fcefcd35ed519d77f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b6679be7b095ca0e992a8185f38142666e015276"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"874129d2b5eda1743199835bfc0b319bfce8b198"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"c6ed903d3f65605aed03725e23f473b7ef8302ab"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"cfca78f0bb00d96538a194c4ae729c0b1fec84b4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"00eae340d0819b7f7c0600bd724ec732361fda51"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"ae33b42e6b5b166c2ff96cdcff3f1036105af9c1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e690d50ad8401b5db544ca273831c15f63a0ec42"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"4959aa870296c0cc905a1d9944e8e86990b4b52d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"56ba709608ada58840dd037aa0a6b9d0b30f6cc3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"77abadc1fbc5b5e25b13d0168981eb9c040f380c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e6a70e9d82a96142447e10fabe5fcb36cc20e9c7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"1cb3d632dac5231dcbb0962b178e443bf109e0f8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"c77a623d752342cf730a6c271c4df36ee01fb870"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2e24ce23f58002643a1938e6903d06f6a94694cc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"b3576dc1053337b8121bb4fd5d1ea84e4733920f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"7d35447c90e2fdd3e682b15d1731e58d8ca531c5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"2c0f745c8ae319db317e6fd8493989cfa4d3b552"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

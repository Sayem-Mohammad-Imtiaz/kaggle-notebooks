However, early and accurate diagnosis of this disease increases the effectiveness of \ncancer treatment, thereby increasing survival rates.**\n\n\n**Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the most common method to diagnose breast cancer. A clinician examines a sample\nunder a microscope and classifies the sample as benign or malignant. However, \nthis method could result in false negatives and false positives through human error.

strategies that could aid early classification \nand diagnoses of breast cancer. One of the core objectives of a practitioner is to accurately diagnose cancer patients and minimize instances of false positives and false negatives. This analysis clearly indicates that the integration of machine learning in the field of oncology has the potential to improve the decision-making ability of healthcare clinicians.**\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# THANK YOU :D","metadata":{}}]}

learning possible? if yes explain**.\nAnswer\nAcording to me there is supervised machine learning is possible as \"Supervised learning\" is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n\nY = f(X)\n\nThe goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.\n\nIt is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\n\n    > FINAL PREDICTIONS FROM THE DATA SET ARE;- \n    -----Countries having DECENT GDP per capita are having more SCORE for happiness.( Rich folks are more happy).\n    -----Countries having low SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR ONE ANOTHER do not have a good life span period.\n    -----Countries having DECENT GDP per capita are having more rate of corruption.\n    -----Countries having more CDP per capita are having better RANKS in the comparison.\nRICH COUNTIRES HAVE MORE CORRUPTION AND PEOPLE THEIR ARE HAVING MORE RIGHTS TO MAKE THIER CHOICES ,NOT EVEN THIS THE RICH COUNTIRES HAD MADE TO THE TOP OF THE TALLY AND HOLD MORE RANKS.\nWHERE PEOPLE DONT COMMUNICATE OR HAVE VERY LESS SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS , THEY ARE NOT HAPPY AND HENCE THEIR LIFE SPAN IS SLIGHTLY LOW AS COMPARED TO THE COUNTIRES WHERE SOCIAL RELATIONS ARE MORE PREFERRED\n        \n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCREATED By;- HRITIK CHAUAHN {18SCSE1140026}\n             CNCS\n             DATA SCIENCE \n             CAT 3\n             ACTIVITY 5\n             GROUP 4\n**             \n# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

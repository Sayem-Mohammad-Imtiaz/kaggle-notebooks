As per Wikipedia definition, customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers. Customer churn rate is a key business metric in any industry and company providing services to end customers, because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.\n\nIn a highly competitive business landscape, the ever increasing rate of customer churn or attrition is a big challenge in front of telecom service providers today. It takes subtantial effort and investment to lure in new customers, while the danger of losing existing customers to competitors is always lurking. Hence, the importance to analyze and understand the reasons of customer's churn had never been felt more. The more the CSPs are able to retain their existing customer base, the better they will perform in the long run.\n\nIn this notebook, we will try to analyze the factors which contribute to the possibility of customer's churn. This analysis is performed based on the publicly available dataset from IBM.\n\n![customer-churn.jpg](https://www.livechatinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/customer-churn.jpg)\nImage Credit: https://www.livechatinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/customer-churn.jpg"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c047266ec064cdbc87749b4e309d356b05e911ba"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### We will follow this simple solution approach for exploratory data analysis:\n1.

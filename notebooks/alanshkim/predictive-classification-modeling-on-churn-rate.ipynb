In this predictive analysis, 3 classification algorithms were performed:\n\n1. Logistic Regression (plus feature selection)\n2. Random Forest \n3. Support Vector Machine\n\nAs shown on the model accuracy results dataframe above, support vector machine had the highest score while logistic regression with chi-squared univariate feature selection had the lowest score. Regardless of the difference in accuracy score, each algorithm comes with their own set of pros and cons. \n\nFor example, although SVM and Random Forest provide the highest accuracy, the systematic functions of both algorithms are generally considered black boxes meaning that only the response/result is accounted for and the function/approach to how the result was produced is of little interest. After all, a forest consists of a large number of deep decision trees, where each tree is trained on bagged data using random selection of features, so gaining a full understanding of the decision process by examining each individual tree is infeasible. As for SVM, the data are transformed by kernel method to another space, which is not related to input space or, in other words, the data before and after SVM implementation are not in the same dimensionality thus cannot be compared. That is why for the SVM performance, feature importance has been excluded not by choice but due to impossibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the logistic regressions clearly had lower accuracy than the two counterpart algorithms. However, they compensate with interpretability as the model can measure how relevant a predictor is (based on the coefficient size) and its direction of association (positive or negative relationship). But then again, logistic regression assumes linearity of the data which, in the real world, is rarely the case.\n\nIs best accuracy the goal? Is determination of feature importance the goal even though the accuracy may suffer? In the end, which method to implement into the business model, again, is determined by business logic, intuition, and goals."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

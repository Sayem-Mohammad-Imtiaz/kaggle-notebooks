If you're unsure how to do this or would like to work with your own data, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial.\n\nOnce you have selected a dataset, click on the **[+ ADD DATASET]** option in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.  \n\n![ex6_search_dataset](https://i.imgur.com/QDEKwYp.png)\n\nOnce you have found the dataset, click on the **[Add]** button to attach it to the notebook.  You can check that it was successful by looking at the **Workspace** dropdown menu to the right of the notebook -- look for an **input** folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset.\n\n![ex6_dataset_added](https://i.imgur.com/oVlEBPx.png)\n\nYou can click on the carat to the right of the name of the dataset to double-check that it contains a CSV file.

You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.  \n\n![ex6_filepath](https://i.imgur.com/pWe0sVb.png)\n\nAfter you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for `my_filepath` in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid filepath.

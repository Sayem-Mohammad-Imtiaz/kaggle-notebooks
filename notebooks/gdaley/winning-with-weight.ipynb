However, if we just leave it at that, we will have neglected several important factors, such as:\n\n - the competition between horses in a race &mdash; _how does one horse's weight compare with others in the same race?_\n - the weight of the horse + jockey (declared_weight) &mdash; _if the horse is already huge, will he notice a few more pounds?_\n - the distance of the race &mdash; _carrying 120lbs over 1000 metres is usually a lot easier than carrying 120lbs over 2000 metres._\n\nIn most handicap races, the weight carried should be between 113 and 133lbs, according to the current handicapping policy described on the [HKJC website][1].\n\nHowever, not all races are the same, and one of the features of handicap races is that horses are grouped into classes, depending on their performance history. In this context, the term \"Handicap\" means a race in which the weights to be carried by the horses are adjusted by the handicapper for the intended purpose of equalising their chances of winning. (As an aside, there is also another category of races in addition to handicaps, known as \"Weight-for-Age\", which means any race for which weights are allotted according to the age and sex of the horse; but we will only consider handicap races here).\n\n[1]: http://www.hkjc.com/english/racinginfo/handicap_policy.asp"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bd773186-8c09-ae92-39c3-7ae76d2b4c5b"},"source":"## Does race class make a difference?"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"df499f9c-9540-9e14-80b9-22f26ed1e3bb"},"outputs":[],"source":"df_runs['race_class'] = df_runs.apply(lambda run: df_races.loc[run['race_id'], 'race_class'], axis=1)\ndf_class_runs = df_runs.groupby('race_class')\ndf_class_runs['actual_weight'].mean()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1b490f97-e018-84f8-561e-70c4675895f0"},"source":"From the table above, we can see that horses running in the higher race classes tend to carry slightly more weight.

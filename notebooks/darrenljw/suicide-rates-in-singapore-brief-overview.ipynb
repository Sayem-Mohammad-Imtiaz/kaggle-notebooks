{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Talking about suicide is a gloomly topic. It is hard to wrap your head around what suicides are going through in their life to wanting to take their lifes' away. Singapore is a well-known for many things and it is often described as one of Asia's economic \"tigers\". Beside our glory branding, we are also ranked second place in terms of the most overworked city in the world after Tokyo [Mire Gonzalez](https://theindependent.sg/singapore-ranks-as-second-most-overworked-city-in-the-world-study/)   Suicide was considered illegal in Singapore until recently, 1 Jan 2020, this law was being revoked [SSO](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr309-). Having a curious mind, I decided to explore how the suicide rate evolved over time in Singapore compared to the rest of the world. Unfortuntely, the dataset only has information uptill 2016 but nevertheless it should give us enough insights of how the suicide rate in Singapore changes over time as Singapore develops.

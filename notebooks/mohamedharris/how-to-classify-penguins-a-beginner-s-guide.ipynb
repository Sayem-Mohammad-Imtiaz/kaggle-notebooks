The problem statement we have in our hand is to classify the species of the penguin, given the different predictor variables. We have the dataset available in hand which has the following predictors and targets.\n\n### Predictors:\n* Sex\n* Culmen Length (mm)\n* Culmen Depth (mm)\n* Flipper Length (mm)\n* Body Mass (g)\n* Island\n\n### Target - Species:\n* Adelie\n* Chinstrap\n* Gentoo","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Problem Type:\n\n### Supervised Learning:\nSupervised learning is a type of training the system by providing labelled inputs. While we feed the system the input features, we also say the expected output. In this case, we are training the system with predictors (independant variables) along with the target (dependant variable).\n\n### Classification:\nClassification is a subset of supervised learning where the output or dependant variable is discrete. We have the 'Species' feature as the target which is discrete.\n\nHence this is a classification problem. However this dataset can also be used to carry out clustering tasks as well. We are not covering clustering in this notebook.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Libraries and Datasets","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first thing to do is to import the required libraries.

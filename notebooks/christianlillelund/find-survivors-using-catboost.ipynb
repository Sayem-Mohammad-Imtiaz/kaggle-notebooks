CatBoost's an open-source ML library that uses gradient boosting on decision trees and has a rich toolkit for things like GPU-based training, model analysis, live metrics and visualization. In this nootebook we'll look at CatBoost using the Estonia dataset.\n\nAbout the data: The datset contains details, like names, age, gender and fate of the 989 passengers abord the MS Estonia at the night of the sinking, 28 September 1994. The MS Estonia was a cruise ferry built in 1979/80 and used to the capricious wheater of the Baltic Sea, but at the night of the 28 a mixture of mechanical failures and poor decision-making collided, which led to her sinking. The diasater claimed 852 lives, which are all accounted for the in data.\n\nNote: Unfortunealy CatBoost plots do not work on Kaggle, but if you run the notebook they do.\n\nFind CatBoost at: https://catboost.ai/\n\nTechnical introduction: https://catboost.ai/news/catboost-enables-fast-gradient-boosting-on-decision-trees-using-gpus\n\nAlso check out Félix Revert's excellent article on CatBoost: https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-learn-catboost-now-390fb3895f76","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.reset_option('^display.', silent=True)\npd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)\n\n# Load the full dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/passenger-list-for-the-estonia-ferry-disaster/estonia-passenger-list.csv')\n\n# List the first five passengers and their fate\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature preparation\n\nFirst let's check for any null values in the data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check for null values\nnull_value_stats = df.isnull().sum(axis=0)\nnull_value_stats[null_value_stats != 0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lucky for us, there weren't any.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Introduction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this study, I present a dataset where it shows the daily average temperature of a lot of cities over almost 20 years. The idea here is to present to the reader some interesting python codes, some statistical tools, and some data exploration concepts. The motivation to write this study was to show how we can use statistics to explore data, and how some statistics tools can be used in a real-life.\n\nFirst I start with some Initial Exploration (session 1) where I use some simple Python commands to know a little bit about the dataset we have. Then I present a Time series plot and outliers (session 1.1) where the idea is to answer the following question: How has the temperature changed over the years 1995 to 2014? Next (session 1.2) I use a Boxplot to answer What is the variation of the temperature in a year? Histograms and the concept of symmetry are presented in session 1.3.\n\nSome probability (session 2) is discussed to answer these questions: what is the probability to have a temperature greater than 70F (21C) in a city? and How to know which city is colder than another one?\n\nI use a simple question (How to know if a temperature is unusual?) to show an example of how to use statistics to make decisions (session 3). Then I return to Histograms (session 4) to show a normality test. I take advantage of the histograms and present an usage of the Central Limit Theorem (session 4.1)\n\nFinally, on the Hypothesis test (session 5) I explain why I use the normality test to answer: How to compare the temperature of two cities?\n\nIn the next study, I'll use the concepts seen here to build a suggestion system. The final idea is to make an algorithm where to a given city, go to the dataset, and show the cities that have the same temperature profile.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Here are all the libraries I'll use in this study\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure\nfrom matplotlib import colors \nfrom matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter \nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport pylab\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency \nfrom pandas import DataFrame\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\nfrom scipy.stats import shapiro\nfrom scipy.stats import kstest \n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/daily-temperature-of-major-cities/city_temperature.csv\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

I would like to explain a little bit about **1) boxplots** and **2) some interpretation of the results we've seen in the plot above.**\n\n1) The rectangles shown in the plot are the interquartile range. Let's see the boxplot for January. The upper side of the rectangle is around 33F. This upper side is the 3rd quartile (or the 75th percentile). It means that 75% of the temperature in January is below 33F. Or if you wish, 25% of the time the temperature is above 33F. The lower side of the rectangle shows the 1st quartile (or the 25th percentile). It means that 25% of the temperature in January is below to 18F (approximately).\n\nSo, with that information, we can see that 50% of the data is in the range of the rectangle. 50% of the time the temperature is between 33F and 18F.\n\nIf we take a look at the temperature of July, for example, we're going to see that the range of the temperature is smaller than in January. It means that the temperature in July is more concentrated, grouped (or less distributed). Going back to January, the red line (around 28F) is the median (or the 2nd quartile also known as 50% percentile). The idea is the same as the 1st and 3rd quartile. It means that 28F is in the middle, 50% of the temperatures in January are above 28F and 50% is below it.\n\nLet's take a look at the minimum and maximum shown on the boxplot. We can see, taking January as an example, that we have -3F and 53F as a minimum and maximum, respectively. Those values are calculated based on the difference between the 3rd and 1st quartile (size of the rectangle known as an interquartile range). These min and max are interesting because can show us the values that are outside that range. Those values are known as outliers. If you take a look at the boxplot for March, April, July, and October you would see some outliers. Those values are considered unusual. This doesn't mean that we should remove those values, the decision to keep or delete them is up to the person who is analyzing the data.\n\n\n2) The first thing I would like to highlight is the range between the maximum and minimum temperatures. You can see that the range for January is much bigger than the range for July. It means that the variation of temperature in January is bigger than July, where the difference between the higher and the lower temperature of the month is not so big as January is.\n\nThe second thing to highlight is the outliers. The temperature of 45F and 50F is an unusual temperature for March but not for January."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.3 Histogram and symmetry"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lastly, I'd like to mention the symmetry/asymmetry of the data.

In general to do this task we could use the t-test (or Student's t-test). However, to compare two cities using the t-test we need first to make sure if the temperature distribution is normal. In that case, we saw that the distribution is not normal. Thus, I need to look for another stats tool that allows me to compare two different groups. The option is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nI'll first compare the temperature of Halifax in two different years 1995 and 2013.\n\nBefore that, I'll see the average temperature for both years."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_halifax = df[(df.City=='Halifax')]\n\ndf_halifax_1995 = df_halifax[(df_halifax.Year==1995)]\n\ndf_halifax_2013 = df_halifax[(df_halifax.Year==2013)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_halifax_2013['AvgTemperature'].mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_halifax_1995['AvgTemperature'].mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that the average temperature of both years are very close to each other.

The idea behind the t-test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is the hypothesis test, where we have a null hypothesis (often called H0) and an alternative hypothesis (Ha). In my case my H0 is \"There is no difference between the groups\" and the Ha is \"There is difference between the groups\". Then, we run the test and it calculates the p-value. With this result, we decide based on a threshold (named alpha) if we will reject or no the null hypothesis. In general, a common value to alpha is 0.05. It means, in the case above where the p-value is 0.82 we will fail to reject H0. In other words, we will not reject the hypothesis H0. So, we'll assume that those groups of values (the group temperatures of 1995 and 2013) are similar. Just a quick note, when we say that we \"reject to fail H0\" this doesn't mean that we ACCEPT the hypothesis. I think this is a matter for another article and it's not the scope of the present study.\n\nLet's see a case where the groups are different."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_beijing = df[(df.City=='Beijing')]\ndf_beijing_1995 = df_beijing[(df_beijing.Year==1995)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"stats.ks_2samp(df_halifax_1995['AvgTemperature'],df_beijing_1995['AvgTemperature']) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"See the p-value is close to 0 (3.2 x 10^-12).

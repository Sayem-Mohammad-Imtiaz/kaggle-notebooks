Recently, USA has achieved to nearly 40 people fully vaccination per hunderd people which is a very gerat result. However, those countries which are relatively low-income countries in Africa and middle-east still waiting for their first does of vaccine from COVAX which is the COVID-19 vaccine delivery project from WHO.

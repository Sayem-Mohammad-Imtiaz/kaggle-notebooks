Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.\n\nThe co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth. \n\n**Business Task**\nAnalyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends and insights for Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n**Business Objectives:**\n\n* What are the trends identified?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n**Key Stakeholders:**\n* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur: Mathematician, Bellabeat’s cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n* Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts guiding Bellabeat's marketing strategy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## STEP 2: PREPARE\n\n**Information on Data Source:**<br>\nThe data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.\nGenerated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.\n30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.\nData collected includes:<br>\n(1) physical activity recorded in minutes, <br>\n(2) heart rate, <br>\n(3) sleep monitoring,<br> \n(4) daily activity and <br>\n(5) steps.<br>\n\n**Limitations of Data Set:**<br>\nData collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, <br>diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.\n<br><br>\nSample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.\nAs data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.\n\n**Is Data ROCCC?**<br>\nA good data

The app can make the users aware of their calory intake and burnt rate information to be vigilant about their habits.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

When tannins are naturally present in the winemaking process or added through aging, the wine will have a more bitter taste. Because tannins also tend to dry out your mouth, people often confuse the tannin level with the “dryness” of a wine, which actually refers to how sweet or not sweet a wine is. The red winemaking process incorporates more tannins, giving some red wines a distinctively dry and bitter finish.\n\n\nBody: Wines get characterized as having a light body, full body or somewhere in between. The “body” of the wine refers to how heavy or light it feels in your mouth. Generally, red wines have a fuller body than whites, as do wines made from grapes grown in warmer regions, rather than cooler ones.\n\n\nAlcohol: The higher the percentage of alcohol in your glass of wine, the more it will warm your throat and the back of your mouth. Measured in percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), most wines contain 11 to 13 percent alcohol, but can range from 5.5 percent all the way up to 20 percent."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the above info we can consider alcohol content matters most and we have seen in the correleation already.\nand next what is intersting is the body of wine.\n\nfrom another source i foind that\n\nWines Under 12.5% alcohol (the alcohol percentage should always be written on the wine’s label) are said to light-bodied. These are generally the white wines we think of as crisp and refreshing. Good examples of these wines are Riesling, Italian Prosecco and Vinho Verde.\n\nWines between 12.5% and 13.5% are considered medium-bodied. Good examples of these wines are Rose, French Burgundy, Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc.\n\nFinally, any wine over 13.5% alcohol is considered full-bodied. Some wines that are normally over this alcohol level and considered full-bodied are Zinfandel, Syrah/Shiraz, Cabernet, Merlot and Malbec. While the majority of wines over 13.5% alcohol are usually red, Chardonnay is a great example of a white that often can also be considered full-bodied."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Alcohol percent < 12.5 => light-bodied\n\nAlcohol percent 12.5 to 13.5 => medium-bodied\n\nAlcohol percent > 13.5  => full-bodied"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data[data['alcohol']<12.5].shape)\nprint(data[(data['alcohol']>=12.5) & (data['alcohol']<=13.5)].shape)\nprint(data[data['alcohol']>13.5].shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"from the above results we can cleary see \nthere are:-\n    \n1508 ligth bodied \n\n78  medium bodied\n\n12  full bodied"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndata.loc[data['alcohol']<12.5, 'body'] = 'Light body' \ndata.loc[data['alcohol']>13.5, 'body'] = 'Full body' \ndata.loc[(data['alcohol']>=12.5)& (data['alcohol']<=13.5),'body']='Half body' ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let us hot encode the body column . i will be using the so called manual method , i will replace the values \n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['body'] = data['body'].replace(to_replace='Light body' , value =0)\ndata['body'] = data['body'].replace(to_replace='Half body' , value =1)\ndata['body'] = data['body'].replace(to_replace='Full body' , value =2)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['body'] = data['body'].astype('category')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.corr()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = data.drop(columns=['quality'])\ny = data['quality']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from  sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,cross_val_score\n\nX_train,X_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2,random_state=47)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":" from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n    \nrf1 = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=200)\n\nrf1.fit(X_train,y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rf1.score(X_train,y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report\npred_rfc = rf1.predict(X_test)\nprint(classification_report(y_test, pred_rfc))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well using randomForest classifier we got arounf 73 percent of accuracy on test set"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

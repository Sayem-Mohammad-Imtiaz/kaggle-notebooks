Common knowledge dictates that this disease is highly linked with habits such as smoking or sedentary behaviour; other diseases such as obesity and diabetes and also genetics. Predicting the likelihood of a person having heart failure would be extremely valuable to the medical field as early diagnosis would enhance the possibility of sound recovery. Machine learning would be a tool to forecast whether a particular patient is likely to suffer from heart failure and hence obtain more resources for treatment.\n\nThis dataset that concerns this notebook was provided in the journal article [Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5) by Davide Chicco & Giuseppe Jurman. It contains a set of features that can be used to predict whether a fatal heart failure will occur in that person.

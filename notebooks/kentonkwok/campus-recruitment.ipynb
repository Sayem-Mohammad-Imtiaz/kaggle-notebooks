Typically, these placement positions are quite competitive, since their numbers are limited. Thus, career-oriented students may want to understand what choices they can make to maximise their success in landing their first job.\n\n## Dataset\nKindly provided by Ben Roshan D (MBA in Business Analytics at Jain University Bangalore), this data set consists of placement data of students in some campus. It includes secondary and higher secondary school percentage and specialization. It also includes degree specialization, type and work experience and salary offers to the placed students.\n\n## Questions\nWe aim to solve these set of questions included with the dataset.\n1. Which factor influenced a candidate in getting placed?\n2. Does percentage matters for one to get placed?\n3. Which degree specialization is much demanded by corporate?\n4.

Conclusion\n\n\nA Random Forest classifier was used to model the factors responsible for successful Campus Placements of students studying for an MBA, achieving an F1 accuracy of 90%. Using this classifier, it was noted that secondary school percentages was the best predictor for whether a person could get a placement. I digress, this seems weird but gives some insight into the question of whether an individual's success is already predetermined during childhood. The worst predictors were degree types.\n\nUsing a t-test, we found that percentage indeed matters with a high degree of significance. A proportion z-test gave the result that those who study the Marketing and Finance specialisation are more demanded by corporates than those who study Marketing and HR, with a p-value of about 0.1%. However, we also spot a slight correlation that those who study the Finance specialisation tend to have higher overall percentages. Thus, this may be the underlying cause of the two deductions we made.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Context\n\nContext copy-pasted from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivan118/healthcare-analytics).\n\nMedCamp organizes health camps in several cities with low work-life balance. They reach out to working people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, MedCamp provides them the facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls (depending on the format of the camp).\n\nMedCamp has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between “Registration” and the Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In the last 4 years, they have stored data of ~110,000 registrations they have done.\n\nOne of the huge costs in arranging these camps is the amount of inventory you need to carry. If you carry more than the required inventory, you incur unnecessarily high costs. On the other hand, if you carry less than the required inventory for conducting these medical checks, people end up having bab experience.\n\nThe Process:\nMedCamp employees/volunteers reach out to people and drive registrations.\nDuring the camp, People who “ShowUp” either undergo the medical tests or visit stalls depending on the format of the health camp."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-summary\"></a>\n## 2. Summary\n\n- Training set has initially ~110k rows and test set ~ 30k rows.\n- There indeed is a big dropout rate. Out of ~110k registrations, roughly 20k has a health outcome. Therefore training set ends up being smaller than the test set.\n- Whereas health scores from camp 1 and 2 are nearly uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, health scores from Camp 3 are just binary (0 or 1).\n\n- Naive Bayes on all numerical variables (train-test split using 20% test) yields 66.6% accuracy, while AUC was 0.72. The result is not great result since 67% of health outcomes are positive in the original dataset.\n\n- Some next steps could be feature engineering on dates, maybe using this [example](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-with-datetime-feature-engineering-predicting-healthcare-appointment-no-shows-5e4ca3a85f96) and just trying more models."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport altair as alt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, plot_roc_curve, accuracy_score\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session\n\ntrain_folder = \"/kaggle/input/healthcare-analytics/Train/\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-data\"></a>\n## 3.

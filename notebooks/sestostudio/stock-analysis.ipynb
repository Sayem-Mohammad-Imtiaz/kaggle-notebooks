The formula for this indicator is:\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1010/1*sTy16YVV5JSyuYk7gYLsbQ.png)\n\nFor stock technical analysis, we have the golden cross and the death cross, which represents the intersection between the Moving Average of 50 days (Short-term) and 200 days (Long-term). If the short term MA stays below the long term MA, the market is considered as bearish and the price is expected to fall. If the short term MA crosses the long term MA at the golden cross, the market is expected to break through.\n\nOr to put it simply, if we see a death cross, consider shorting your stock.

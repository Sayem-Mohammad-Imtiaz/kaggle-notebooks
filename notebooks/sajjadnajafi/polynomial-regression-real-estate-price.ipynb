Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.\n\nThe explanatory (independent) variables resulting from the polynomial expansion of the \"baseline\" variables are known as higher-degree terms. Such variables are also used in classification settings.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression)\n\n**Although polynomial regression is technically a special case of multiple linear regression, the interpretation of a fitted polynomial regression model requires a somewhat different perspective. It is often difficult to interpret the individual coefficients in a polynomial regression fit, since the underlying monomials can be highly correlated.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import Libraries:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-10T13:58:16.701238Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-10T13:58:16.701692Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-10T13:58:17.722308Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-10T13:58:16.70166Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-10T13:58:17.721117Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Adding Dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This dataset has 8 columns.

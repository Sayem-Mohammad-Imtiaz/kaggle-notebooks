Type 0 (typical angina) is likely related to normal condition, thus indicates lower risk of heart attack. Type 3 (asymptomatic) is unclear, but tends to indicate risk of heart attack in this data set;\n- For **resting eletrocardiographic results**, type 1 (having ST-T wave changes) is likely related to risk of heart attack. These wave changes possibly signal [unsatisfactory blood pressure control](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380254/). Type 0 (normal) and 2 (hypertrophy) are likely related to lower risk of heart attack. However, left ventricular hypertrophy ([diagnosed on ECG](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0002870368900355)) is related to [cardiovascular morbidity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000287030125488X);\n- For **maximum heart rate achieved**, it is possible to observe that higher heart rate values are related to higher risk of heart attack (see further information [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19615487/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20shown%20that,pressure%20by%2010%20mm%20Hg.));\n- For **slope of peak exercise ST-segment**, type 2 (downsloping) is likely related to risk of heart attack. ST segment depression during exercise is possibly linked to coronary artery diseases and/or anatomically or functionally severe coronary obstruction (see [here](https://www.jacc.org/doi/abs/10.1016/0735-1097(95)00085-I)). Type 0 (upsloping) might be related to an [ischemic response to exercise](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11868055/), which means shortage of oxygen caused by restriction in blood supply to tissues. Although it [might be normal to see mild upsloping ST-segment during heavy exercise](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487312444370), one must carefully analyse the context in order to yield prognostic value from it.

With that in mind, one can see how this low prevalence can affect a small data set such as this one we are using.

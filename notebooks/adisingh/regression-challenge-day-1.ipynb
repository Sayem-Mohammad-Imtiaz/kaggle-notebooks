(With your dataset you'll need to come up with your question by picking one variable to predict and one to use to predict it).\n\nIn order to build a model, I need to know what type of variable whether or not a recipe is a dessert is. There are three choices:\n\n* **Continuous**. These are numeric variables that can take any value, including decimals. Examples include temperatures or prices.\n* **Count**. These are numeric variables that can only take positive integer values. Examples include the number of people at a party or the number of cars in a parking lot.\n* **Categorical**. These are not numbers. Categorical variables tell you whether or not an observation is part of a specific group. Good examples include gender or whether someone owns more than ten hats.\n\nThe best way to figure out which one is a variable is is to use your knowledge of a dataset and the world in general. For example, I know that whether or not a recipie is a dessert is a *categorical* variable, while the number of calories in a dessert is probably a *count* variable (unless you have a very, very accurate measure of calories, in which case it might be continuous).\n\nThere are some quick tests you can do to double-check, though. For example, I might want to know if the ratings for a recipie are categorical, count, or continuous. First, I can check if they're numeric:","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6dc1f11b-5d4b-4f28-869a-958fd7aa282d","_uuid":"409e34e284429408d4225b71d3fae9263dbd2c90"},"source":"# are the ratings all numeric?\nprint(\"Is this variable numeric?\")\nis.numeric(recpies$rating)","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"97e80dea-1db9-43a3-9609-de333f3c30ed","_uuid":"21d2e83ef0fc129f0e08e610358ab646afeef2f1"},"source":"So I know it's represented by a numeric variable in this dataframe. This means that ratings are probably not things like \"very good\" or \"very bad\".\n\nNext, I can check if all the values are integers (whole numbers). If so, it's probably a count variable. If not, it's probably continuous.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7ed0b43f-e731-4001-b286-ab15a7288d09","_uuid":"85a343c580fe208edcbc7b2fa2ba00c5d6553a08","collapsed":true},"source":"# are the ratings all integers?\nprint(\"Is this variable only integers?\")\nall.equal(recpies$rating, as.integer(recpies$rating)) == T","cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8470cacf-c9f7-4a1c-964a-02d12acf4c95","_uuid":"7f0c8a44b23130b6faf15ec078351c7e6f5476ae"},"source":"So, in this dataset, ratings are a continuous variable.

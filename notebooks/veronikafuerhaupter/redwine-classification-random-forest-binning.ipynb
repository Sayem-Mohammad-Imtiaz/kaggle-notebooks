Conclusion\n\nWe loaded the data and had a quick look. As a result we can state:\n- There are instances of red wine with 11 features of chemical values and identified quality with classes 3,4,5,6,7 and 8.\n- There is no missing data.\n- Some classes are underrepresented.\n\nWe visualized the data and found out:\n- No features are significantly correlated, so we kept every features.\n- The boxplots for every class show that points outside the interquartile range are not related to the imbalancy in the data. \n\nWe deleted outliers by trial and error comparing the amount of classified outliers with the outliers in the pairplot\nWe standardized our training and test data and trained a random forest model. We used random forest because we are dealing with classification and experience showed high performance adressing classification. \nFor optimizing the parameters, we used Gridsearch searching widely used parameters. \n\nThe evaluation of the predicted results showed a lack of performance predicting the underrepresented quality classification right. \nTherefore, we categorized the different classes into bad, medium and good quality and retrained the model using the modified categories. \nAs a different approach we oversampled the underrepresented classes with SMOTE and retrained the model using the initial classes. \nIn the end we combined binning with oversampling. When oversampling the data, we always made sure, only the training data is oversampled, test data is kept in its initial state.\n\nBinning the data without any oversampling data treatment worked out best regarding the accuracy score of ~88-90%. But those results need to be looked at critically since they will never classify a wine with poor quality and also when classifying excellent quality the performance is lacking. \nAny oversampling approach failed to improve the single classification or the binned classification better. \n\nThe feature importance confirmed what we could already guessed from the boxplots.

I will not explain the complete concept of KNN here.\nBut a brief explanation is enough to give you and idea. \nLets take a real life example. Suppose there are two basket B1 & B2. B1 has 80% RED BALLS, B2 has 90% BLACK BALLS.\nNow when your friend tells you to get one ball with your eyes covered from B1 & ask you which color it can be?\nSO in this case, your mind thins in a programmed way. It thinks B1 has mostly RED BALLS, so probably the\nball will be red. \nSo what your mind analyzed? \nBasically your mind analyzed the probability of ball being red and black. But our ball was form B1 so the\nprobability of being RED was more. Which you calculated according to the number of other balls already presented\nin the basket 1. You can other balls were neighbour of the ball which you drew. So most of the neighbours of the\nball which you drew were RED, so you said it must be red. \n\nKNN works in the same way, when you try to predict the category of a point(which we call classification), it first finds out its neighbour. By \ndefault it consider 5 nearest points(neighbour) and find out the category of all the points. then it find out\nwhich category has most number of points and assign it to the new point. By default KNN algo takes 5 neighbour.\nBut you can change according to your algorithmm and case. That is why KNN decision boundary mostly not \nlinear as Logistic regression. KNN is a type of Non-Linear classification.\n'''"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Create Feature & Target Matrix"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_animals.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#X = df_animals.iloc[:, 1: 17].values\nX=df_animals.loc[:, [\"milk\", \"backbone\", \"toothed\", \"venomous\", \"domestic\", \"aquatic\"]].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = df_animals.iloc[:, 17].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Split Data Into Train & Test Set"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Create Classifier"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric=\"minkowski\", p=2) \n# n_neighbors: number of neighbors.

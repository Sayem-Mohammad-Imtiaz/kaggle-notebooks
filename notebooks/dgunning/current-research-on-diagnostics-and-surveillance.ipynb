If the target antigen is present in sufficient concentrations in the sample, it will bind to specific antibodies fixed to a paper strip enclosed in a plastic casing and generate a visually detectable signal, typically within 30 minutes. The antigen(s) detected are expressed only when the virus is actively replicating; therefore, such tests are best used to identify acute or early infection.\n\n**WHO does not currently recommend the use of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care, although research into their performance and potential diagnostic utility is highly encouraged**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Important finding on antibody tests\n\nFrom [Rapid point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a community screening setting shows low sensitivity 2020-April](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0033350620301141)\n\n**Results**\nOf 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR.

Let's break down the graph to gain an understanding.\n\nEach bullet chart is a measurement of the average monthly charges compared against the average charges of customers who churn and customers who stay. The dark blue bar is the average monthly charges of customers that do not leave, the green bar is the average monthly charges of churned customers and the black vertical line is the the target value which represents the average monthly charges across the entire sample size. On the right side of the graph we see the actual monthly average costs for churned customers and how much over the target average it falls.\n\nNow that we have an understanding of what the graph represents we can see that for every contract type, the average monthly charges of customers that churn are not only higher than the target value but are vastly higher than the customers that do not churn. Since the target is the average across the sample size we would expect to see a target value a bit higher than that of the average charges of customer that retained the service and that is exactly what we find.\n\nWhat is interesting is the gap difference between the target and retained customer charges, the gap widens as the contract term gets shorter. Also, the average charges of customers that churn increases as the gap between target and retention charges decreases. There is a reason for this.\n\nAs we saw earlier, **Month-to-month contracts make up 55%** of the company's contract agreements and we also saw that **43% of these customers end up leaving**. Because these contracts make up such a high number of the contracts there are many more customers under this contract umbrella. With a higher sample size and over 40% churn rate, we would expect to see the target value somewhere in the middle between charges of customers that churned and those that did not, and that is exactly what we find. The goal in this contract type would be to find some convergence in the 3 different charge areas, that is to bring the target, churn, and retained averages all closer to the same average amount that would have a higher probability of retention.\n\nThe next two graphs show the trend as we would expect to see it for the target value and the retained customer average charges. This gap begins to decrease as the sample size shrinks and the percentage of churn decreases, with 11% churn on One Year contracts and only 3% on Two Year. Because the churn rate is much smaller, the average charges across the entire sample size decrease and converges closer the the retention average. However, there is still a huge discrepancy on the charges of those customers that are lost. We can see that the lower the churn rate of a contract type, the higher average monthly cost for those that do ultimately churn. This is also an area we can explore to determine the how we can bring that high monthly charge down closer to the target.\n\nNow that we have the data analysis complete and have an idea of some characteristics that relate to churn, let's explore how we can present the findings to the business to decrease churn and ultimately increase retention.\n\n****"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Presentation of Data:\n\nStay tuned as we prepare to present the data and then implement our predictive model"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bank Customer Churn Research Project\n\n**Research question:**\nThis notebook will focus on determining which non-sociodemographic customer attributes can help us predict whether or not the customer will leave the bank.\n\nMore specifically, we will explore some of the features of the clients provided in the dataset, such as:\n- Credit Score\n- Tenure\n- Balance\n- Number of products\n- Salary\n\n**Explanation:**\nI want to eliminate the distortion caused by some sociodemographic attributes (e.g. age, sex) since they can predetermine the psychologial and behavioral aspects of a customer. For example, younger people are likely to be more flexible in terms of choosing the bank, while people of older ages may experience difficulty in switching between banks.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, I want to focus only on business-related features of a customer (if we can say so).\n\n\n**Motivation:**\nI work for a bank and one of my recent projects was connected with determining customer attributes which influence customers activity. I did the research by manually exploring the database and plotting excel graphs. Now that I've gained some skills in Python, I could possibly find some new insights and use Machine Learning tools to predict customers' activity based on their characteristics.\n\n**Expected resuls:**\n1. A set of factors which determine a customer's decision to leave the bank + their correlation coefficients.\n2. A model that helps predict whether or not the customer will leave the bank.\n\n**Practical value:**\n\nThe model will have a practical application in the banking sector, particularly for the bank I work for. This solution will help us find weak spots in our customer base and thus re-activate the customers which are likely to leave the bank.\n\n**Further research:**\n\nAfter I find some interesting insights from this research, I wish to conduct a more detailed product-related analalysis. Particularly, I want to find out what specific banking products (deposits, current accounts, credit cards etc.) make the customer stay with the bank."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset used:\nPlease find the link for the dataset used in this project: https://www.kaggle.com/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers\n\n**Content of the dataset**:\n- **RowNumber:** corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output.\n- **CustomerId:** contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.\n- **Surname:** the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.\n- **CreditScore:** can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.\n- **Geography:** a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.\n- **Gender:** it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.\n- **Age:** this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.\n- **Tenure:** refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n- **Balance:** also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n- **NumOfProducts:** refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\n- **HasCrCard:** denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.\n- **IsActiveMember:** active customers are less likely to leave the bank.\n- **EstimatedSalary:** as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.\n- **Exited:** whether or not the customer left the bank.  (0=No,1=Yes)\n\n**Data cleaning:**\n\n**Step 1**\n\nThe provided Dataset is quite clean and does not contain any outlier values. This was chekced with the use of the following functions:\n- .isnull().values.any()\n- .info()\n- .describe()\n\nHowever, if we get back to our initial purpose, we will not need all of the features to be included in our final dataset. Therefore, I deleted some of the columns which constitute sociodemographic aspects of a customer (e.g. 'Surname', 'Gender', 'Age').\n\n**Step 2**\n\nRight now the dataset contains values from three countries: Germany, Spain, France.\nWe don't know where the data comes from, whether it's from one single bank, or an aggregata data. So, to avoid the dilution of insights, let's focus on one country. If the analysis provides some actionable insights, the findings could be extrapolated on other countries. Maybe we will still need the aggregate data, so I will save a copy of the original dataset.\n\nFor now, the dataset is ready to go.

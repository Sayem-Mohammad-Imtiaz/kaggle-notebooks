A few rules associated with this broad statement are as follows: the next state is entirely dependent on the previous state. The next state is determined on a probabilistic basis\n\nTo put this into the context of a Meaningful Random Headlines generator, we used a dataset containing ABC news headlines. That dataset contains x number of words where there are probably many words used multiple times. For each word in the dataset,the words directly after are grouped together where words that occur more often are weighted more heavily. When generating text, a random word is chosen and from that a random word from the list of words is selected continuously until the desired word count is reached.The more often a word appears after another, the higher the probability that it will be selected in the text generator.\n\nWhile the concept is simple, the hardest part of creating a generator using Markov Chains is to ensure you have enough text in your dataset so the text you generate doesnâ€™t end up being the same words over and over.\n\nHowever, in order to effectively generate meaningful headlines,you will need to provide a dataset that will contains headlines of similar categories and add weights to the probabilities of the words selected.

Right now, its main use is for building Markov models of large corpora of text, and generating random sentences from that. But, in theory, it could be used for other applications. It is good in generating sentences that fits the model.Especially the markovify.Text model gives you a sentences that start with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation,and it does not repeat the same sentence twice\n\nThis module can be installed using pip:\n\npip install markovify","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Dataset\n\nThis includes the entire corpus of articles published by the ABC website in the given time range.

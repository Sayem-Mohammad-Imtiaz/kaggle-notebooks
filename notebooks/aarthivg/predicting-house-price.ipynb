determine the price\n* yr_built is having good effect on price, even though it is not having a linear relationship with price, it is influencing price too\n* zipcode, same as latitude is having some influence\n* waterfront and view are also having effect on price, which is observed from bivariate too\n* The number of bathrooms is having little effect on price as we saw from bivariate, but number of bedrooms is not having that much effect.","metadata":{}}]}

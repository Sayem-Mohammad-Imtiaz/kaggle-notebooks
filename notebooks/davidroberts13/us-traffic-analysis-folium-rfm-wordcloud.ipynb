These accidents claim the lives and livelihoods of millions of people a year all over the world.  A study by the Department of Transportation's, [National Highway Traffic Saftey Administration](https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812013) (NHTSA), placed a price tag of over a quarter-trillion dollars in 2010.  I have seen several projects diving into this problem from the perspective of loss of life property or employment, all of which are noble in nature. I want to explore something else, something more trivial, and infuriating TRAFFIC! That's right, and I will be analyzing and building a machine learning model to predict an accident's impact on traffic. Through analysis of observations like weather, time of year, location, and many more, we might be able to alleviate the modern leech on our precious free time.\n   \n   By better understanding the critical factors influencing a collision effect on traffic flow, we can reduce the number of total crashes and limit the time they steal from us. If done correctly, this work could help add precious time to our days.  To defeat them, we first understand them as Sun Tzu said, \"know your opponent, and you will never lose'. We must learn what makes traffic tick, and we will do it through careful feature engineering and model choice. If we can establish a pattern,  we would deploy available resources to combat these conditions that worsen traffic. \n\nThis analysis will help inform the driver of critical areas better and plan their route accordingly and decision-makers on the local level and above on resource allocation. \n   \n   *TLDR* Car crashes have many issues associated with them that are horrible and life-changing. Traffic, however, affects us the most regularly. This analysis will aim to understand better the conditions that make a crash cause a higher traffic load."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### *Data:*\nThis US-Accident Dataset is a countrywide dataset covering 49 US states. It has 3.5 million separate traffic accidents taking place from **February 2016** to **December 2019**. \nBased on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n* Information describing the collision\n* Various measurements and observations of the weather\n* Types of roadway or infrastructure involved \nWe choose to use the data's entirety in our predictive efforts to better our target audience of governmental decision-makers.

While types, abilities, effort values, individual values and held\n\n\nitems play their own roles, it is important to look at base stats as well.  There are tournaments\n\n\nwhere teams are limited based on the base stat totals of its members, so as to promote fair play.\n\n\nAfter looking into various pieces of data, it is now known that the average base stat total of one such\n\n\nPokemon is 435.1025.  For individual stats, speed is often considered one of the most, if not the most \n\n\nimportant; as going first can mean winning or losing in games.  The average speed of all Pokemon falls\n\n\nat an average of 68.2775.  While in competitive battles, the speed stat of most Pokemon fall above 90.\n\n\nWith legendary Pokemon serving as the main draws and mascots of games, they unexpectedly\n\n\ncarry the stongest of base stats.

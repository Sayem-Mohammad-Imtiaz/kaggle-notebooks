Currently, they look at the details of each customer and based on this information, decide which offer should be given to which customer.\n\nNow, the bank can potentially have millions of customers. Does it make sense to look at the details of each customer separately and then make a decision? Certainly not! It is a manual process and will take a huge amount of time.\n\nSo what can the bank do?

Centroids of newly formed clusters do not change\n2. Points remain in the same cluster\n3. Maximum number of iterations are reached\n\nWe can stop the algorithm if the centroids of newly formed clusters are not changing. Even after multiple iterations, if we are getting the same centroids for all the clusters, we can say that the algorithm is not learning any new pattern and it is a sign to stop the training.\n\nAnother clear sign that we should stop the training process if the points remain in the same cluster even after training the algorithm for multiple iterations.\n\nFinally, we can stop the training if the maximum number of iterations is reached. Suppose if we have set the number of iterations as 100. The process will repeat for 100 iterations before stopping.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"+3\" color=\"purple\"><b>Importing the Library</b></font>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nplt.style.use(\"fivethirtyeight\")\n\n# for interactive visualizations\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected = True)\nfrom plotly import tools\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"+3\" color=\"purple\"><b>Reading the Dataset</b></font>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"### Loading the Datasets\nmall_data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/Mall_Customers.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Read the top 5 rows using plotly library\ndata = ff.create_table(mall_data.head())\npy.iplot(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"##### Check the Descriptions of the datasets using plotly library. \ndesc = ff.create_table(mall_data.describe())\npy.iplot(desc)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#### Visualizing the null values using missingo function\n\nimport missingno as msno\nmsno.matrix(mall_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"+3\" color=\"purple\"><b>Data Visualization</b></font>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = (16,5))\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nsns.distplot(mall_data['Age'])\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nsns.distplot(mall_data['Annual Income (k$)'])\n\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nsns.distplot(mall_data['Spending Score (1-100)'])\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- In Age columns most people belong to 18 to 50 Age, \n- Maximum Annual Income 45k to 90k.\n- Maximum Spending Sore is 50","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Prepare Data\ndf = mall_data.groupby('Gender').size()\n\n# Make the plot with pandas\ndf.plot(kind='pie', subplots=True, figsize=(15, 8))\nplt.title(\"Pie Chart of Vehicle Class -

What can we learn from that? Is it because the player with the ball chooses to shoot from far away, in order to make sure that the shot will not be blocked? is it because the defending player want to have a buffer that would allow him to compensate for a speed disadvantage? either way, this distance represents some kind of FEAR. We will explore this fear factor in the following script using Kaggle's great new feature that allows extracting data from multiple data sets in one script. Namely, we would use the 2014-2015 NBA shots data set with a players data set from the same year which I have uploaded. \n\nIn this script:\n\n 1. How does the height and other factor affect the defender distance?\n 2. Who are the players who keep their defenders closest?\n 3.

This does make sense since 3P% is not the perfect measure for how big of a threat a players poses if it doesn't take into account the number of threes he actually makes (and of course this figure is very noisy for players who took fewer shots).\n\nPau Gasol is a clear out-liar though. Clearly defenders don't take him as seriously as they should when he shots from down town. It probably has something to do with the general lack-of-grace of his style.","metadata":{"_uuid":"db870ef1e2a2e112efdc19c919e6e440877dee0a","_cell_guid":"0c9c2a16-ed3d-d58f-4a6c-c91eb4b9e8ec"}},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"18fd954a37a8a39842bdf94b8d0a8a4e30228655","_cell_guid":"c5168278-3e84-8ddf-efc3-3e6aa2159c0d","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"players[players.Name == 'pau gasol']","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9f53c38061bc6a3bb68f61a7596c0e3121def17","_cell_guid":"75d29f04-33b6-eae1-5c4a-d2ca2c836921","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"players['Average_shot_distance'] = players.Name.apply(lambda x: np.mean(shots.SHOT_DIST[shots.player_name == x]))","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a16b3ab78ff2fc0b088b8572d9a599bbc57d7114","_cell_guid":"49503b9e-54b9-88c8-49ae-325d7784e294","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"X = players[['Height','Average_shot_distance','PTS','3PM','Age','Average_Def_Dist']]\n\nX = X[np.isnan(X.Height) == False]\nX = X[np.isnan(X.Average_shot_distance) == False]\n\nX_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X.drop(['Average_Def_Dist'], axis = 1))\ny = X.Average_Def_Dist*0.3048\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_std, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_train,y_train)\n\nmodel.predict(X_test)\n\nplt.barh(range(len(X.columns)-1),model.coef_)\nplt.yticks(range(len(X.columns)-1),['Height','Average_shot_distance','PTS','3PM','Age'], fontsize = 10)\nplt.title('Regression Coefficients')\n\nprint('R^2 on training...',model.score(X_train,y_train))\nprint('R^2 on test...',model.score(X_test,y_test))","execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Predicting the average shot distance is easier, given that there's lower variance in such configuration. \n\nWe see that the defender gets closer the older the attacker is, and the more points and 3Ps he makes.\n\nThe taller and further from the basket the attacker is, on the other side, the further the defender stays from the shooter. \n\nSo, it seems that the 3PM, general points and height coefficients  represent a situation where the defender chooses his distance from the attacker based on the attacker average shooting skills - the better they are , the close the defender would be.\n\nThe age can be a proxy to a different situation, where the defender would get closer to an older player knowing that he is not fast enough and is therefore less likely to pass him.","metadata":{"_uuid":"ff284ff0caea85702c401f19860c5f714fec5f13","_cell_guid":"ca1a7a8b-9a31-a358-8a87-8ce562df3b5d"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The rise of Stephen Curry\n\nWhile Curry's numbers were already quite amazing in 2014, it was by the end of 2015 when he won his first MVP award, and since then is arguably the best player in the world (a title he shares with at least 3 other players in today's interesting league). \n\nDid his great season and progress change the way defenders treated him, in terms distance at least?\n\nlet's look at the average defender distance during a 3-points shot and the aggregated 3 points percentage along the year.

Average weighted F1 score was 0.69 and 0.64 on train and test respectively. \n\nRandom Forest also gave similar scores but the class counts in RF predictions showed that minority classes were being misclassified, i.e. almost all restaurants with \"rare\" ratings were being misclassified as having a more \"common\" rating.

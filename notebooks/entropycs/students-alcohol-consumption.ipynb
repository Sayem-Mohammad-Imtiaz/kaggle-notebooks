Of course, it is impossible to answer that question given the fact that we have data from only two schools. The only question that could be answered with the dataset provided is if alcohol consumption is \"somehow related\" to school performance for the students of that school and for that particular year, and it turned out that it does not.\n\nA serious study would require a large sample of randomly selected students and schools.\n\nThe causal implication of alcohol consumption to school performance can only be proved by means of running a controlled experiment. Unfortunately, that cannot be done in practice, sice we can not ask students to consume large amounts of alcohol during an accademic year.\n\nA final note about \"research ethics\" is worth mentioning. It is highly surprising that the authors of the study have disclosed the real names of the schools from which the data was gathered. Morevoer, if we take into account that the dataset is, by no means, statistically significant. That could lead to all sorts of mistakes and misunderstandings that should have been avoided.

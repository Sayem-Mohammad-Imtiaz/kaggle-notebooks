The aim of this project is not to achieve the highest accuracy rating possible but to build a model using simple classification methods. More robust models are outside the scope of this project. This is because it is important to get a better understanding of the data using simpler models first before using more complex models. Further, it may be that the simpler models may solve the problem and also have the benefit of providing more interpretable results than the complex models. \n\n## The Data\n\nWe use the data set provided by the \"HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists\" Kaggle competition. This data set has 19158 rows and 14 columns.\n\n\nColumns are as follows:\n\n- enrollee_id : Unique ID for candidate\n\n- city: City code\n\n- city_ development _index : Developement index of the city (scaled)\n\n- gender: Gender of candidate\n\n- relevent_experience: Relevant experience of candidate\n\n- enrolled_university: Type of University course enrolled if any\n\n- education_level: Education level of candidate\n\n- major_discipline :Education major discipline of candidate\n\n- experience: Candidate total experience in years\n\n- company_size: No of employees in current employer's company\n\n- company_type : Type of current employer\n\n- lastnewjob: Difference in years between previous job and current job\n\n- training_hours: training hours completed\n\n- target: 0 – Not looking for job change, 1 – Looking for a job change","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are going to go through each variable seperately, clean it, perform EDA, and prepare it for modeling.

Deep-learning models for example may give better results however,that is outside the scope of this project.","metadata":{}}]}

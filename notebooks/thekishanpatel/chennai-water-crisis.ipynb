Climate change is most readily associated with the melting of artic/antartic ice-caps, but it also leads to more antithetical phenomena, such as droughts; an example of the latter can be seen in Chennai, historically kwown as Madras--a major metropolis in southern India. This exercise explores Chennai's 'water histoty' over nearly the last 20 years--including the recent crisis. \n\nChennai has four major reservoirs that supply water for the populus. The combined capacity of these 4 reservoirs is ~11057 mcft. The four major reservoirs are: POONDI, CHOLAVARAM, RED-HILLS, CHEMBARAMBAKKAM. In this exercise, we evaulate the water-levels and the rainfall-levels in these four reservoirs to evaluate the severity of the crisis.

On their way to explore the Mars, the shapeship undergoes series of internal component failure in the navigation and flight parts. It was time for the crew to repair the issues . But there was one Imposter one Betrayer one Anamoly among them and to identify who that is there are set of tasks which has to be performed in the data to reveal who is the imposter in the dataset.\n\nTo understand what this this project really focuses on is that there are many realtime cases we are witnessing on tracking abonormal data which possess a serious threat to the business in the field of IT, health and various other sectors. Even though the cyber security teams are forging to figure out the anomaly behaviour in the transactions, the system built using algorithms are not efficient enough to capture all anomaly's. Huge millions of money are lost due to the cyber attacks. It not only affects the business revenue but also the reputation and trust of doing business with the firm.\n\n## Where to find the Imposter ?\nTO find the imposter in our spaceship, we use [umenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab), where we consider speed_6005 which has the dataset with 2500 rows of the speed for specific sensors in the spaceship.\n\n**CSV name**: speed_6005.csv\n\nIn these dataset above, The crew will analyse the dataset with time-series visualizations and perform analysis to detect the anomaly records and thereby capture the imposter.

Hence, when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.\n\n1. How Isolation Forest works<br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*d-4xINDQHv0G82o2GUApJQ.png)<br>\nAbove I show examples of the procedure after four splits, respectively. In this case, I had only two features `x` and `y` and four observations to check. The first condition is the one that distinguishes a normal observation from an anomaly. If `x` is bigger than 120, then the observation is an outlier and is coloured in red. Then, normal and anomalous data points can be distinguished based on average path length: **shorter paths indicates that we have anomalies**, while **longer path shows that there are normal observations**.\n\n2. Anomaly Score<br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1704/1*D78QLbcwXesymhquuofnOg.png)<br>\nThe isolation forest needs an Anomaly Score to have an idea of how anomalous a data point is. Its values lie between 0 and 1. The anomaly score is defined as:<br>\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/3000/1*GMWS-FkTTYWaRgOhKV_QCQ.png)<br>\nwhere `E(h(x))` is the average of `h(x)`, which is the path length from the root node to the external node `x`, while `c(n)` is the average of `h(x)` given n and is used to normalize `h(x)`. There are three possible situations:\n - When the score of the observation is close to 1, the path length is very small, and then the data point is easily isolated. We have an **anomaly**.\n - When the score of that observation is smaller than 0.5, the path length is large, and then we have a **normal data point**.\n - If all the observations have an anomaly score around 0.5, then the **entire sample doesn’t have any anomaly**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Algorithm Workflow\n\n> Isolation forest is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** for anomaly detection that works on the principle of isolating anomalies, instead of the most common techniques of profiling normal points.\n> 1.

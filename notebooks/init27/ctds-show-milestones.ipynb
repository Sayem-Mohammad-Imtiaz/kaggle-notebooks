[Read More about it here](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science/discussion/168310#936323). \n\n\nAfter some Chai and brainstorming, the idea of hosting a competition was born, to make the \"stars\" (actually dates, but that was more dramatic), align, the timelines chosen were:\n\n- Launching the competition on the date when the **first recording** was done.\n- In true spirit of the podcast, hosting a few events to encourage participation by all levels of participants.\n- Again, Kaggle Hereos and legend Kernel Grandmasters agreed to being judges for the competition!\n- Finally,

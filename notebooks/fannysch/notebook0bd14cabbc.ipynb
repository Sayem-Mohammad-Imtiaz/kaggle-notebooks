Each respondent in this happiness survey is asked the same questions in his or her own language to produce statistically comparable results.\n| https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx\n\n### Dissecting the data: \n* Country name (country_name): The country's name\n* Life ladder (score): The final \"happiness score\" a country receives based on the sum of the following six factors.\n* Log GDP per Capita (log_gdp): The logarithm of the real GDP per Capita supplied by the International Monetary Fund.\n* Social support (social_support): The perceived amount of social support, obtained via the question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?\"\n* Healthy life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy): Number of years of life expectancy for people born in the observed year (without underlying conditions).\n* Freedom to make life choices (freedom): The perceived amount of freedom of life choices, obtained via the question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”\n* Generosity (generosity): Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n* Perception of corruption (corruption): The perceived amount of corruption in the interviewee's country, obtained via the questions: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”.\n* Positive / Negative Affect: The positive / negative affect is a representation of the subjective happiness of the observed sample size of a country averaged over the last three years. Around 1000 subjects are questioned face-to-face or via telephone each year for most countries (some countries are underrepresented for various reasons, e.g. struck by war).

This helped us to start our analysis and give us a hint about our research questions. Next, we plotted the correlation matrices so that we could analyse which indicators have the most impact on the score. We found out that especially GDP, Life Expectancy and Social Support were the most important influences in the happiness score. \nThe most interesting contries usually are the most extreme data. For us, this were the top and bottom 10 countries. We found out that the score of the top 10 countries slighty decrease over time except for Venezuela. Unfortunately, we couldn't really find the reasons for the huge drop for Venezuela in our data but with a little googling, we learned that in 2010, poverty and inflation began to rise and in 2013 shortages in e.g. flour, milk and other necessary resources caused malnutritions. In 2016, Venezuelas president degreed an \"economic emergency\". After that, the borders were opened for import and the economy started to get better again. All these increases and decreases can be seen in the second last diagram in section 3. \nLastly, we compared the continents and looked at their development in detail. Overall, Oceania seems to have the highest average happiness score over the years. The specific details can be found in section 4. \n\nWe were very excited while working with the data set. Having seen the different impacts an indicator can have and analysing the development of said indicators with regards to different countries, continents or just time was interesting and fascinating. Nevertheless, the data set carries much more information than we discovered and it will always be intriguing to occasionally check the new World Happiness Report. ","metadata":{}}]}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Logistic Regression"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression). Mathematically, a binary logistic model has a dependent variable with two possible values, such as pass/fail which is represented by an indicator variable, where the two values are labeled \"0\" and \"1\". In the logistic model, the log-odds (the logarithm of the odds) for the value labeled \"1\" is a linear combination of one or more independent variables (\"predictors\"); the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled \"1\" can vary between 0 (certainly the value \"0\") and 1 (certainly the value \"1\"), hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name. The unit of measurement for the log-odds scale is called a logit, from logistic unit, hence the alternative names. Analogous models with a different sigmoid function instead of the logistic function can also be used, such as the probit model; the defining characteristic of the logistic model is that increasing one of the independent variables multiplicatively scales the odds of the given outcome at a constant rate, with each independent variable having its own parameter; for a binary dependent variable this generalizes the odds ratio."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Libraries and Utilities"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/biomechanical-features-of-orthopedic-patients/column_2C_weka.csv\")\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.describe().T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"f,ax=plt.subplots(figsize = (6,6))\nsns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot= True,linewidths=0.5,fmt = \".2f\",ax=ax)\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.yticks(rotation=0)\nplt.title('Correlation Map')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data[\"class\"] = [\"a\" if each == \"Abnormal\" else \"n\" for each in data[\"class\"]]\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = data.iloc[:,0:6].values\ny = data.iloc[:,-1].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Train Test Split"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x_train, x_test,y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x,y, test_size = 0.13, random_state= 0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Standard Scaler"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sc = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc.fit_transform(x_train)\nX_test = sc.transform(x_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Accuracy"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lr = LogisticRegression()\nlr.fit(X_train,y_train)\nlr_score = lr.score(X_test,y_test)\nprint(\"Logistic Regression Accuracy: \"\"%.2f\" % lr_score);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prediction"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(y_pred)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(y_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pr = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"y_pred\",\"y_test\"], index= None)\npr[\"y_pred\"] = y_pred\npr[\"y_test\"] = y_test\npredictions = []\nfor i in range(0,pr.shape[0]):\n    if pr.iloc[i,0] == pr.iloc[i,1]:\n        predictions.append(\"True\")\n    else:\n        predictions.append(\"False\")\npr[\"prediction\"] = predictions\npr.head(15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Confusion Matrix"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one (in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix).

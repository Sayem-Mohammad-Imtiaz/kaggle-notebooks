It seems that as a country increases their literacy rate, the birthrate experiences a reduction. What does this mean? One suggestion is perhaps populations are able to be more literate being freed of parental responsibilities. Consider China with the largest population, literacy rate of 90.9% and birthrate of 13.25, which had been given a policy restricting birthrate. Did this policy lend to the improving the literacy rate in later years? In comparison, the United States which did not experience such implementations has a strong literacy rate of 97% with a low birthrate of 14.14.\nLiteracy increases critical thinking and perhaps this results in delaying the creation of families due to work commitments. \n\nThe top 5 countries in the dataset with the lowest birthrate all have literacy rates over 93.5% (Hong Kong rate). Interesting to think about is how the impact of affairs between Hong Kong and China may translate to the country's literacy rates in the years ahead, with or without birthrate experiencing change.

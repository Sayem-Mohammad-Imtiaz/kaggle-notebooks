{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What's this notebook?\nThis notebook is an analysis done over a couple of hours on the popular songs on Spotify for 2019.\n\n## Why this notebook?\nTried Spotify for a couple weeks, wasn't extremely appealing. Then saw the data, had a few subjective opinions, and thought I'd confirm things that I thought I already knew.\n\n## For whom is this notebook?\nWell, anyone who's not looking for serious data analysis and very intense machine learning. Although, there is one track that's got some explicit terms on it's title. So it's kinda PG+(?) :P\n\n## What are assumptions made during this analysis?\n* All analyses are based only on the numbers in the data. \n* Any opinions are based on data, and probably my own subjective thoughts, well they're mostly duh! moments in them. \n* No major analyses done.\n  * Except for that one pairplot visualization towards the end which shouldn't really be done, but it's easier than generating so many other graphs in separate plots and unnecessarily complicating this\n* External Factors for the track (Sentiment for the song, release dates, lyrics, YouTube likes/dislikes/views/comments/whatever etc.) not considered.\n* Correlation does not equal causation. So, Pop music doesn't mean the death of metal (but would it kill to have a couple of Jazz or Metal or Rock or something besides Pop in the top 50?! ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the data, the file has got an encoding that's not UTF-8\nsong_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/top50spotify2019/top50.csv\", encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\n# Read the 2018 data from another user, this will only be used for comparing popular artists from the previous years.\nsong_data_2018 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018/top2018.csv\")\n\n# There was an Unnamed column which was basically the index, which I'll be dropping.\nsong_data.drop(\"Unnamed: 0\",axis=1,inplace=True)\n# Format the columns into a more accessible format.

The playstyle is now more oriented toward early three point shot and fast offensive transitions. Many analyst have been wondering if this basketball revolution benefits to the show and helps the team to win the matches. \n\nThe case is of great interest because the NBA (and in general the american sports) is one of the first sports where the data analytics are heavily exploited to increase the efficiency of the teams. The raising of three point shots comes just from the Big Data analysis.\n\nOne of the most relevant example is the landing in NBA of Daryl Morey as the General Manager of the Houston Rockets in 2006: his experience in the computer science and statistics world leads to a data driven playstyle. The criticisms were not missing from NBA fans and former players. Nevertheless, data are now used by any NBA team and it is one crucial aspect to take into account to build a winning team.\n\nIn our analysis we want to explore the efficiency of the three point shots and asking if there is an ideal amount of threes to maximize the chance of victory. In order to achieve our purposes we build a machine learning model capable to predict the probability to win. Thereafter we adopt our machine learning model to visualize the non-linear dependence between the three point shots attempted and the chance of winning.

The colours represent the target class, with orange indicating ‘No Rain Tomorrow’ and blue - ‘Rain Tomorrow’. The first and third scatterplot show clear separation of target classes at approximately 65% thershold of humidity level at 3pm: the humidity above that threshold significantly increases chances of rain the next day. Similarly, pressure below 1005 hpa signals higher probability of the rain the next day. Although sparsity of datapoints below 1005 hpa threshold indicates that in general pressure below that level occurs rarely in Australia. Finally, sunshine for more than 7 hours during the day reduces probability of rain the next day. Negative correlation between ‘Sunshine’ and ‘Humidity’ can be also noticed, which may be explained by the fact that the sunshine may reduce the level of humidity.\n\nTo investigate the effect that the feature selection has on predicitive accuracy, I have tested the accuracy of SVM prediction on 3 datasets containing 8 features, 3 features and 2 features. Before training SVM classifier I have standardised data to standard deviation 1 and mean 0. Then, I have balanced the data by Random Undersampling and held out 25% of test data for measuring accuracy. I have used cross-validation grid search to select the best hyperparameters. Radial kernel with C100 and Gamma 0.001 worked best for 8 and 3 dimensional dataset, while linear kernal with C10 was selected for 2 dimensional feature space. As expected, the accuracy decreased with lower amount of features. Interestingly, reducing dimensions from 8 features to 3 features lowered the accuracy by only 1.08%, while reducing dimensions from 3 features to 2 features cut the accuracy by 3.09%.

Note that due to vagaries of releases, re-releases, re-issues and general madness, sometimes the release years are not what you'd expect.\n* Added - the earliest date you added the track to your collection.\n* Beats Per Minute (BPM) - The tempo of the song.\n* Energy - The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic. song\n* Danceability - The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song.\n* Loudness (dB) - The higher the value, the louder the song.\n* Liveness - The higher the value, the more likely the song is a live recording.\n* Valence - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song.\n* Length - The duration of the song.\n* Acousticness - The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.\n* Speechiness - The higher the value the more spoken word the song contains.\n* Popularity - The higher the value the more popular the song is.\n\nHowever, for the dataset provided the 'year' category wasn't included.\nIt can be assumed all these songs were released in 2019.\n\nWith all this information. I wondered if there was a clear distinction for the variables provided and the popularity scored provided by spotify?\n\nLet's find out!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, log_loss\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"songs_df = pd.read_csv('../input/top50spotify2019/top50.csv',encoding='ISO-8859-1')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inspection/Cleaning\nWe will begin by inspecting and cleaning the dataset. \n1.

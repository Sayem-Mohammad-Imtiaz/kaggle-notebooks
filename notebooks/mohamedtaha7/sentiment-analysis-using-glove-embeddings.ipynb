simply sorting the most frequent words in a vector, and for the word occurrence in a sentence, it is replaced by the vector with it's value set to 1 and all other values are 0s\n\nFor example, if the first word here is 'Movies', it will be represented as [1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nA big disadvantage of one-hot-encoding that it doesn't represent the difference and similarity between words, so it treats words such as 'Movie' and 'Film' as two completely different words, although the meaning is very close.\n\n**Word Embeddings**\n\n![](https://x-wei.github.io/images/Ng_DLMooc_c5wk2/pasted_image.png)\n\nOn the other hand, a word embedding is a pre-trained feature representation of a word learned from a larger corpus, which helps the model to distinguish more between words and treat words like 'Movie'

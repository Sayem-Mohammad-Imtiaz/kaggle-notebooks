In this case study, I am presented a scenario where I will be working for Urška Sršen and I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into **how consumers are using their smart devices**. \n\nIn order to help guide Bellabeat in unlocking new growth opportunities, I am requested by Urška Sršen to analyze available consumer data, which for this scenario I am to use a dataset by [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)). This dataset contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. These thirty Fitbit users had consented to the submission of personal tracker data, which includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It also includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits. \n\n<br>\n\n#### **Key Stakeholders**:\n\n*     **Urska Srsen** - Bellabeat cofounder and CCO\n*     **Sando Mur** - Bellabeat cofounder\n*     **Bellabeat marketing analytics team**\n    \n#### **Bellabeat's Key Products**:\n\n*     **Bellabeat app**: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n*     **Leaf**: Worn as either a bracelet, necklace, or clip; the Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n*     **Time**: A wellness watch that uses smart technology to track the user's activity, sleep, and stress.\n*     **Spring**: A water bottle that tracks daily water intake. The bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track the users hydration levels.\n*     **Bellabeat membership**: A subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.\n\n<br>\n\n## <ins>Business Objective</ins>\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n\nAs this dataset has more than 10 csv files available, I am encouraged by Sršen to use as much as I can in order aid my research.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n#just in case i need to visualize missing values\nimport missingno as msno\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-05T09:08:55.9357Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-05T09:08:55.936538Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-05T09:08:56.298249Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-05T09:08:55.936404Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-05T09:08:56.297213Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Prepare Phase**\n\nThe datasets are gathered internally by FitBit, therefore the data can be safely assumed to be unbias and credible.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Summary of my findings:\nAfter analyzing the data, I have found some insightful information that may be of interest for Bellabeat. As a reminder, Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. Here are some business marketing recommendations that I can give to Bellabeat:\n1. I suggest Bellabeat to give notifications to their users who had been idle during the day to consider doing some light exercises. And with my previous finding that shows that being sedentary is associating to lack of sleep, it shows that the more idle you are, the lesser the quality of one's sleep may be. Therefore, this reason may serve as a good incentive to encourage users to be more active as this may allow them to sleep better when it's time for bed. \n\n2. I recommend Bellabeat to notify/remind users to do some exercises between 5pm and 7pm as this is when most users finish work and start exercising based on the data. This is also a great opportunity to encourage those who might have a goal to lose weight to start exercising on this time frame. \n\n3. Bellabeat should consider notifying users the importance of at least getting more than 8000 steps per day as this will benefit the users in the long run. This is based on a [research](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0324-daily-step-count.html) by CDC that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Therefore, it is highly recommended for Bellabeat to consider this advice into consideration for their next marketing strategy. \n\n4. As users tend exercise more on Saturdays, Bellabeat can use this information to remind users to do some exercise on Saturdays as they are more likely to be more motivated. Also, there seems to be a noticable drop in activity when it is Sunday. Therefore, I recommend Bellabeat to encourage users to be more proactive during the Sundays as, based on the data, users tend to be a bit more laidback on Sundays. Users also seem to oversleep the most on Sunday, therefore Bellabeat should consider advising their users to be mindful of this as oversleeping is associated with risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and death ([source](https://amerisleep.com/blog/oversleeping-the-health-effects/))\n\n6. Bellabeat should notify users when their heart-rate detected to be outside the range of 60-100 BPM as this may signify a potential underlying health condition that the user may not be aware of.\n\n7. By combining the fact that Tuesday has the most steps taken and that average total intensity is the highest, this might be the very reason why the users on this dataset are undersleeping the most on Tuesday. Bellabeat should consider advising their users to exercise meditation so as to calm themselves on stressful days. ","metadata":{}}]}

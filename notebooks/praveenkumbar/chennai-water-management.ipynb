Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is the biggest cultural, economic and educational centre of south India. Population of Chennai is close to 9 million and is the 36th largest urban area by population in the world\n\nChennai is entirely dependent on ground water resources to meet its water needs. Ground water resources in Chennai are replenished by rain water and the city's average rainfall is 1,276 mm1.\n\nFollowing are the major sources of water supply for Chennai city.\n\nFour major reservoirs in Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam\nFollowing are the major sources of water supply for Chennai city.\n\n1. Four major reservoirs in Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam\n2. Cauvery water from Veeranam lake\n3. Desalination plants at Nemelli and Minjur\n4. Aquifers in Neyveli, Minjur and Panchetty\n5. Tamaraipakkam, Poondi and Minjur Agriculture wells\n6. CMWSSB Boreweels\n7. Retteri lake\n\nThe above one is also roughly the descending order in which the contribution is made to overall fresh water requirements of the city. In addition to this, people make use of borewells and private tankers for their water needs.\n\nChennai is facing an acute water shortage due to shortage of rainfall for the past three years (and we had one of the worst floods in history the year before that!). As a result, the water in these resources are depleting along with the groundwater level.

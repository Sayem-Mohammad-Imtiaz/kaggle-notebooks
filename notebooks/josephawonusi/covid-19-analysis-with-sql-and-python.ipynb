others, only the (cumulative) total;\n* Total number of vaccinations - this is the absolute number of total immunizations in the country;\n* Total number of people vaccinated - a person, depending on the immunization scheme, will receive one or more (typically 2) vaccines; at a certain moment, the number of vaccination might be larger than the number of people;\n* Total number of people fully vaccinated - this is the number of people that received the entire set of immunization according to the immunization scheme (typically 2); at a certain moment in time, there might be a certain number of people that received one vaccine and another number (smaller) of people that received all vaccines in the scheme;\n* Daily vaccinations (raw) - for a certain data entry, the number of vaccination

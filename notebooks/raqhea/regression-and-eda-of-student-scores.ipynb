Preparing the Dataset and Building a Model\nIn order to build a model, we should have a good understanding of the dataset. We can try to build a linear model because of the linear correlation between `pretest` and `posttest` scores. If it performs well, I won't try to dive deep into the model building process","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# I won't use every categorical variable, `school`, `classroom`, `student_id` variables will be excluded\ncat_feats = ['school_setting', 'school_type', 'teaching_method', 'gender', 'lunch']\n\ntarget = dataset['posttest'].values\ndata = dataset.iloc[:, :-1]\n\ndata = pd.get_dummies(data, columns = cat_feats)\n# scale the data\ndata_mean = data.loc[:, ['n_student', 'pretest']].mean().values\ndata_std = data.loc[:, ['n_student', 'pretest']].std().values\ndata.loc[:, ['n_student', 'pretest']] = (data.loc[:, ['n_student', 'pretest']] - data_mean) / data_std\n# normalize the target data using pretest's mean and std\ntarget = (target - data_mean[1]) / data_std[1]\n\ndata.drop(columns=['school', 'classroom', 'student_id'], inplace = True)\ndata.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-24T17:06:52.509158Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-24T17:06:52.509647Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-24T17:06:52.571696Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-24T17:06:52.509615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-24T17:06:52.57089Z"},"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def adjusted_r2(y_true, y_pred):\n    \"\"\" \n    Returns adjusted R^2 score of the given true target data and predictions, adjusted r^2 also penalizes additional independent variables in the training set.\n    Variable `p` on the below is the number of independent variables used to predict the target. \n    \"\"\"\n    N = y_true.shape[0]\n    r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)\n    p = 13\n    score = 1 - ( (1-r2) * (N-1) ) / (N - p - 1)\n    return score\n\nx_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, target, test_size = .25)\n\nlr = LinearRegression().fit(x_train, y_train)\ntrain_preds = lr.predict(x_train)\npreds = lr.predict(x_test)\n\n\nprint(\"Linear model's performance on the training and test data\")\nprint(\"train: \\t MSE: %f | MAE: %f | R^2: %f | Adjusted R^2: %f\"%(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_preds), mean_absolute_error(y_train, train_preds), r2_score(y_train, train_preds), adjusted_r2(y_train, train_preds)))\nprint(\"test: \\t MSE: %f | MAE: %f | R^2: %f | Adjusted R^2: %f\"%(mean_squared_error(y_test, preds), mean_absolute_error(y_test, preds), r2_score(y_test, preds), adjusted_r2(y_test, preds)))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-24T17:07:55.694506Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-24T17:07:55.694903Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-24T17:07:55.776069Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-24T17:07:55.694878Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-24T17:07:55.775287Z"},"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\nWell, at first I thought that there are not enough data for the prediction. But with given features, the linear model did a pretty good job. \nWe can say that model didn't overfit the training data and it's quite robust since r^2 and adjusted r^2 don't differ too much.\n\nSince I don't work on tabular data too much, I thought it would be a good exercise to do exploratory analysis on this dataset. If you read this far, I'm glad. \nPlease upvote if you liked the notebook. Thank you very much for your time :)","metadata":{}}]}

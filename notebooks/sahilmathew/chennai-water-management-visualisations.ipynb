{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following project seeks to visualize the dam and rainfall levels in the four main dams supplying water to the south indian city of Chennai. \n\nChennai hit an acute water crisis in 2019. 19th June was declared 'Day Zero' implying that the city has completely run out of water. As we will see below, Chennai recieves healthy rainfall through the year, even more than the average rainfall of London. \nIndescriminate borewell digging, encroachment of catchment areas, loss of farmland have led to dire crisis the city faces. \n\nThere are four dams around Chennai- Poondi, Redhills, Cholavaram and Chembarambakkam, that are responsible for catering to the city's needs. However, we see that the water levels in these dams approached close to zero in 2019. \n\nI have visualised the water levels in these dams and the rainfall it receives from 2004 to 2019. The data has been made availible by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewarage Board. \n\n*Note: I have avoided using units in these graphs for this draft as I have found quite a few discrepencies among other kernels uploaded on this page. Hence, I would urge you to use the graphs as purely a visual tool. *\n\n\nSources:\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/07/18/742688141/the-water-crisis-in-chennai-whos-to-blame-how-do-you-fix-it](http://)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Chennai_water_crisis](http://)\n\n[https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/chennai-water-crisis-a-wake-up-call-for-indian-cities-66024](http://)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#importing all the required libraries ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"level=pd.read_csv('../input/chennai_reservoir_levels.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rainfall=pd.read_csv('../input/chennai_reservoir_rainfall.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rainfall['Date']=pd.to_datetime(rainfall['Date'])\nlevel['Date']=pd.to_datetime(level['Date'])\n#converting date column to a timestamp ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#creating a new column called year.\nrainfall['Year']=rainfall['Date'].map(lambda x: x.year)\nlevel['Year']=level['Date'].map(lambda x:x.year)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"meanlvl=level.groupby('Year').agg('mean')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"meanlvl=meanlvl.reset_index()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"meanlvl\n#the mean level of the dam ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nx=meanlvl['Year']\ny=meanlvl['POONDI']\ny1=meanlvl['CHOLAVARAM']\ny2=meanlvl['REDHILLS']\ny3=meanlvl['CHEMBARAMBAKKAM']\nfig= plt.figure()\naxes = fig.add_axes([0.3, 0.3, 0.9, 0.9])\naxes.set_title('Reservoir Levels (2004-2019)')\naxes.set_xlabel('Year')\naxes.set_ylabel('Water level (mcft)')\naxes.plot(x,y,'b',label='Poondi')\naxes.plot(x,y1,'r',label='Cholavaram')\naxes.plot(x,y2,'g',label='Redhills')\naxes.plot(x,y3,'orange',label='Chembarambakkam')\naxes.legend()\nplt.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see from the graph above, the water levels in all four dams approaches 0 in 2019.

If rainfall is present, there has to be another explanation of why these dams are drying up. One reason could be the over exploitation of ground water in the city which has run the water table dry, this puts pressure on the reservoirs to supply all the water. Groundwater has to be replinished, but this is near impossible with catchment areas being encroached. Unchecked development and a concrete cover all over the city prevents water from seeping into the ground. \nRain water harvesting was implemented in Chennai from 2000, however, it seems that the muncipal organizations have become complacent in checking these policies. \nI hope the chennai water board will implement a strong water management strategy that keeps the ecology of water systems in the middle.

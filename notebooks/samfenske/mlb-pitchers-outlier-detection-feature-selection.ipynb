Notice that the white blocks outline an identity matrix, because a variable is always going to be 100% correlated with itself. An example of two variables with a high ratio is hits and runs. The more hits a pitcher gives up, the more likely they are to give up runs. In certain instances one may avoid letting up runs, but over a long career they are going to be very closely correlated. An example of two variables with a low ratio is saves and innings pitched. Saves are typicaly reserved for a closing pitcher to come in and pitch the very last inning of the game.

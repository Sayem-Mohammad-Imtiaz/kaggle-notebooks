That's no news, everyone knows that by now. Every industry is being affected by AI, AI/ML startups are booming ... No doubt, now sounds like the perfect time to be a data scientist !  \nThat being said, two industries stand out for me when it comes to applying machine learning : **Healthcare and Economic Development**. Not that other applications aren't useful or interesting but those two are, in my opinion, showing how we can really use technology to make the world a better place. Some impressive projects on those fields are being conducted right now by several teams; *Stanford* has an ongoing project about predicting poverty rates with satellite imagery, how impressive is that ?!\n\nHere in Kaggle, we already have experience with the first one (healthcare), for example, every year there's the *Data Science Bowl* challenge where competitors do their very best to achieve something unprecedented, in 2017, the competition's goal was to **improve cancer screening care and prevention**.  \nI was very excited and pleased when I got the email informing me about the Kiva Crowdfunding challenge and it's nice to know that this is only the beggining, with many more other competitions to come in the Data Science for Good program.\n\nBeing myself very interested in those issues and taking courses such as *Microeconomics* and *Data Analysis for Social Scientists* (If interested, you can find both courses [here](https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/), excellent content proposed by MIT and Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab), I decided to publish a notebook in this challenge and take the opportunity to use everything I've learned so far.     \n**Through this notebook**, I hope that not only will you learn some Data Analysis / Machine Learning stuff, but also (and maybe mostly) learn a lot about economics (I'll do my best), learn about poverty challenges in the countries where Kiva is heavily involved, learn about how you can collect data that's useful in those problems and hopefully inspire you to apply your data science skills to build a better living place in the future !\n\n**P.S : This will be a work in progress for at least a month. I will constantly try to improve the content, add new stuff and make use of any interesting new dataset that gets published for this competition.**\n\nEnjoy !"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d19172c98fd068ec72e017358fe5879e82fb06a5","_cell_guid":"8d34051f-a274-40bc-ba9c-0c0dfb3cbe05"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of contents\n***\n\n* [About Kiva and the challenge](#introduction)\n\n* [1.

When you go to kiva.org, you can choose a theme (Refugees, Shelter, Health ...) or a country and you'll get a list of all the loans you can fund with a description of the borrower, his needs and the time he'll need for repayment. So far, Kiva has funded more than 1 billion dollars to 2 million borrowers and is considered a major actor in the fight against poverty, especially in many African countries.\n\nIn this challenge, the ultimate goal is to obtain as precise informations as possible about the poverty level of each borrower / region because that would help setting investment priorities. Kagglers are invited to use Kiva's data as well as any external public datasets to build their poverty estimation model.  \nAs for Kiva's data, here's what we've got : \n* **kiva_loans** : That's the dataset that contains most of the informations about the loans (id of borrower, amount of loan, time of repayment, reason for borrowing ...)\n* **kiva_mpi_region_locations** : This dataset contains the MPI of many regions (subnational) in the world.\n* **loan_theme_ids** : This dataset has the same unique_id as the kiva_loans (id of loan) and contains information about the theme of the loan.\n* **loan_themes_by_region** : This dataset contains specific informations about geolocation of the loans.\n\nThis notebook will be divided into two parts : \n1. First I will conduct an EDA using mainly the 4 datasets provided by Kiva. \n2. After that, I'll try to use the informations I got from the EDA and external public datasets to build a model for poverty level estimation."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f8535617e3348e7e9f76a56c3d3347e7967c5c82","_cell_guid":"8e5fc6b2-fb5f-4232-98f2-5d509b705b85","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport math\nimport missingno as msno\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid')\npalette = plt.get_cmap('Set1')\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4ff1b507a8d3eb704239921713c87eaac10d566c","_cell_guid":"2270d1a8-c607-490c-87f1-4054801d1831"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

It refers to Purchasing Power Parity.

Indeed, an estimated **1.374 billion people live on less than  1.25 \\$ per day** (at 2005 U.S. PPP) and around **2.6 billion (which is basically 40% of the worlds's population !!) live on less than \\$ 2 per day**. Those impoverished people suffer from : undernutrition / poor health, live in environmentally degraded areas, have little literacy ...\n\nAs you can see, poverty seems to be defined exactly by the way it's actually measured, but what's wrong with that definition ? **In developing countries, many of the poor work in the informal sector and lack verifiable income records => income data isn't reliable**. Suppose you're the government and you have a specific program that benefits the poorest or you're Kiva and you want to know who's in the most critical condition, then relying on income based poverty measures in developing countries will be misleading and using unreliable information to identify eligible households can result in funds being diverted to richer households and leave fewer resources for the programâ€™s intended beneficiaries.

Getting city-wise data is a different story, let alone district data for example.         \nAs you can see in this challenge, most of the datasets that were uploaded by kagglers to help with the given task actually provided coutry-wise informations.     \nThose informations usually can help getting some insights but can't do much when it comes to building a granular model for poverty estimation.\n\nLooking for sources for data, the first two that come to mind are **The World Bank and The DHS Program**. The later one proved to be a goldmine so let's talk about it in a more detailed fashion.\n\n\n### 2.4.1 What's the DHS Program ?\n<a id='data'></a>\n\nThe Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program is responsible for collecting and disseminating accurate, nationally representative data on health and population in developing countries. Since 1984, The DHS Program has provided technical assistance to more than 300 demographic and health surveys in over 90 countries.   \nSo looking into that, I found that the DHS Program has some extremely detailed data. For exemple if you select one country, it can in fact give you the survey results for each household that responded to the survey !! Amazing right ? Well that comes with some costs (completely worth it though) : \n* First of all, You have to log in the website, build a project and explain what data you want to have access to and what do you want to do with it.  Your answers are verified afterwards and if everything goes well, they'll give you authorization to download and use the data. That being said, you don't have the right to publicly share that data  (for example uploading it as a public dataset on Kaggle), it's for private usage only. You can of course share the results you obtain by your usage.\n* After downloading the data, you'll notice that the raw data is hard to deal with : You get hundreds and hundreds of columns with weird names and you have to process all of that. They have a couple of video tutorials on their website for people  who'll use their data for the first time to understand the norms they're using and how to find the information you're looking for.\n\nThankfully, in our case, a Kaggler got his hands dirty and did a wonderful job with this DHS data. As I was struggling to retrieve information from the raw DHS data, [FrÃ©dÃ©ric Kosmowski](https://www.kaggle.com/fkosmowski) published his awesome [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/fkosmowski/matching-kiva-s-borrowers-with-dhs-clusters) that produces a new dataset that matches Kiva's loans to DHS data.\nI want to put emphasis on the fact the work he has done is phenomenal. If you go over his R code you'll notice that there's a lot done there. Not only that, I contacted him saying asking for some guidance regarding my own model and he has been very helpful. Since then, we've been constantly exchanging and I want to thank him for that. It felt good collaborating with a fellow Kaggler on a competition that's actually a part of the #DataScienceForGood program.\n\nSo let's get to work using the DHS data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5b6332e6d087ca5f14d747c8c2ff0b48445ebef8","_cell_guid":"3f26b2ab-efa3-48d7-a078-87b4a54d4b6d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"According to Kiva provided data, the most precise model was considering the MPI on a regional level.

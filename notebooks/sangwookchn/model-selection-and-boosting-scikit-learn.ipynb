I added some useful notes along the way to clarify things. This notebook's content is from A-Z Datascience course, and I hope this will be useful to those who want to review materials covered, or anyone who wants to learn the basics of Model Selection and Boosting.\n\n## Content:\n### 1. K-Fold Cross Validation\n### 2. Grid Search\n### 3. XGBoost\n--------\nThese techniques above are used to improve model performance. \n\n# 1. K-Fold Cross Validation\nThis technique is useful to evaluate bias and variance more accurately. It splits the training set into k groups, and in each iteration, the algorithm chooses different test fold (individual section) for testing. This allows every part of the training set to be used for testing.\n\n### Dataset overview"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndataset = pd.read_csv('../input/social-network-ads/Social_Network_Ads.csv')\ndataset.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6a800e1fba6f02286998464c0bdae6e3c508dd40"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Using this fictional dataset, the company wants to know whether a customer will buy its product based on age and estimated salary.\n\nI will add the Cross Validation part to a standard Kernel SVM model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2429c71c13be77bfc85988cd0fbfe15c1643799c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = dataset.iloc[:, [2,3]]\ny = dataset.iloc[:, 4]\n\n#split test and train set\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)\n\n#feature scaling\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsc = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = sc.transform(X_train)\n\n#building the model\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nclassifier = SVC(kernel = 'rbf', random_state = 0)\nclassifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)\n\n#predicting based on the model\ny_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a0a96cb15ccf09f2c67cbf74a9e07f07bfab09e5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Now Let's apply K-Fold Cross Validation**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bbbf535c7aaeb5fcce44dd71f36ad547473c272f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\naccuracies = cross_val_score(estimator = classifier, X = X_train, y = Y_train, cv = 10)\n#cv --> number of parts (folds): 10 is the most common practice\n#estimator --> put the trained model.\nprint(accuracies)\nprint(accuracies.mean()) #this is a better evaluation of the model.\nprint(accuracies.std()) #to get a sense of variance and bias","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9377011c8b48075d34a82d0a2852b177256d1f3b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Using the mean of all the accuracies is a better estimation of the overall performance of the mode. \n\n# 2.

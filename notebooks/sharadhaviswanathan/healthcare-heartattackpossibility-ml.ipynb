Over half a million Americans die of heart disease each year - almost **1 in every 4** deaths - with costs of health services, care and productivity loss amounting to over **200M$** each year.\n\nMore specifically, **1 in every 5** heart attacks is silent - with the damage being done and the person impacted is unaware of it. Early action is critical and knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack could help. It would be even more beneficial if we can effectively predict the possibility of a heart attack and take preventive action.\n\nHeart attack (a.k.a *myocardial infraction*) happens when a part of the heart muscle doesn't get enough blood. And the more time passes without restoration of blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Coronary artery disease (**CAD**) is the major cause for heart attacks and is caused by plaque build-up in the arterial walls and other parts of the body. Plaque is made up of deposits of cholesterol and other substances. Plaque build up causes the arteries to narrow and over time, this can block (partially or wholly) blood flow.\n\nRisk factors include age, family history and lifestyle choices. While age and family history can't be controlled, appropriate lifestyle choices can help mitigate the incidence of heart attacks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About the data set\nThis database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.

This is interesting to note, as one reason why the higher rate of  attrition in the sales department is due to the fact higher level of stress. This maybe related to companies profits and sales where they will have  to meet deadlines and sales goals to increase the companies sales per quarter and from the same quarter last year. The Year over year (YoY) performance metric is very important to companies as it gauges how well the company is doing and helps guides through the current year. This increase in pressure from stakeholders can trickle down to sales executives and associates which ultimately increases stress. I am not indicating there isn't stress in the HR and R&D department, I am just suggesting it may be a different kind of stress.

People tend to leave during the early stages of the company they are working if they they are going into their first company.

People tend to leave if the monthly income is <2500. This again can vary depending on the location this data is based on. There is a different standard of living in each state. People will tend to stay as long as they are fairly compensated.\n1. People may leave during their mid to late 30s for various reasons. This can overlap with compensation, moving to a different company that they wanted to go to before but lacked the work experience or because of major life events. Life events can include marriage, or starting a family. These are things that people may take priority over work.Depending on the life events occurred, settled and have managed their work life balance, people tend to stay in the company longer as they would like to have a stable job and have the opportunity to move up in their company. \n1. Different departments have different attrition rates. Depending on the type of department, different types of stress and stress levels can have an effect on a person. Stress in sales may have a higher impact than in HR and R&D department. \n1. Job satisfaction has an impact on attrition.    \n<br>        \nOf course some of these observations are not surprising, such as employee compensation and lack of promotions may have an increase in attrition. However it is good to see how this specific company is doing on this. Some of these observations maybe obvious but it's good to see the numbers and if any kind of intervention can lead to a change in these numbers. While this dataset was very well put together, it would be nice to see what state the this company data is based on. It would be good to see what the standard of living is for this dataset is. Additionally, it would be interesting to see the race and ethnicity of the employees are.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-01T16:13:29.725831Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-01T16:13:29.726158Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-01T16:13:29.740993Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-01T16:13:29.726127Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-01T16:13:29.739587Z"}}}]}

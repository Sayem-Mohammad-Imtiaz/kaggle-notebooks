There were indeed, low subscribed courses with very good ratings over 3.5. Like the saying goes, \"quality over quantity\".\n* From a course instructor's standpoint, it should be noted that the number of published tests does not guarantee very good rating for a course. We could see a vast majority courses with 0 tests climbing the ratings ladder with excellent points.\n* After analysising variables affecting ratings, I can come to a conclusion that the pricing of courses have adverse effect on rating of courses. Courses around 10 - 20 dollars seemed to have impressive ratings over a handful of more expensive courses. However, there is a caveat but before diving into that, we should bear in mind that most courses on Udemy are discounted and offered at the 10 - 20 dollars rate which makes sense in my conclusion above. A reviewer rating a 10 dollars course will have different expectations compared to when rating a more expensive course. This can have a biased effect on overall ratings and public impression on a course.","metadata":{}}]}

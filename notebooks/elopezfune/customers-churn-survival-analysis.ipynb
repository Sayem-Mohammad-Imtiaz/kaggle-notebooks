{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Customers Churn\n \nCustomers churn refers to the amount of customers of a given company that stop using products or services during a certain time frame. One can calculate the churn rate by dividing the number of customers lost during that time period -- say a quarter -- by the number of existing customers at the beginning of that time period. For example, starting the quarter with 400 customers and ending with 380, the churn rate is 5% because 5% of your customers dropped off.\nFor Business Intelligence, this is one of the most important metrics to look at since loosing clients now-a-days is very easy, compared to retain the existing ones. Companies should aim for a churn rate that is as close to 0% as possible. In order to do this, the company has to be on top of its churn rate at all times and treat it as a top priority.\n3 Ways to Reduce Customer Churn\nFocus the attention on the best customers. Rather than simply focusing on offering incentives to customers who are considering churning, it could be even more beneficial to pool the resources into the loyal, profitable customers.\nAnalyze churn as it occurs. Use the churned customers as a means of understanding why customers are leaving. Analyze how and when churn occurs in a customer's lifetime with the company, and use that data to put into place preemptive measures.\nShow the customers that you care. Instead of waiting to connect with the customers until they reach out to you, try a more proactive approach. Communicate with them all the perks you offer and show them you care about their experience, and they'll be sure to stick around.\nIn this project, I will use several tools from Survival Analysis to focus on a customer retention program from the Telco company (https://www.telco.com/company-profile). Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer's attributes described on the column Metadata.\nThe data set includes information about:\nCustomers who left within the last month: the column is called Churn\nServices that each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies\nCustomer's account information: how long they've been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\nDemographic info about customers: gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading the dataset\ndataframe = pd.read_csv('../input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')\n# I have changed the name of some columns for a better aesthetic\ndataframe = dataframe.rename(columns={'customerID': 'Client', 'gender': 'Gender', 'tenure': 'Tenure'})\ndataframe['SeniorCitizen'] = dataframe['SeniorCitizen'].replace([0,1],('No','Yes'))\ndataframe['Churn'] = dataframe['Churn'].replace(['Yes','No'],[1,0])\n#There were some formatting errors in Total Charges, so I correct them\ndataframe['TotalCharges'] = dataframe['TotalCharges'].replace(' ', np.NaN)\ndataframe['TotalCharges'] = pd.to_numeric(dataframe['TotalCharges'])\ndataframe","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The database counts with 7043 entries and 21 columns.

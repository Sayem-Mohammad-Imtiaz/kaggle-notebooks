A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.EDA generally takes a lot of time.\n\n> But,what if we could do it in just a single line of code in just 1 minute.Isn't it amaizing guys!!!Yes!! We could do it using Some librarys of Python.**SweetViz** is one of them.It's fast!! And it gives EDA of the whole dataset within a few seconds.\n> Sweetviz is an open source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with a single line of code. Output is a fully self-contained HTML application.The system is built around quickly visualizing target values and comparing datasets. Its goal is to help quick analysis of target characteristics, training vs testing data, and other such data characterization tasks.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Importing Necessary Libraries & the dataset in which i'm going to perform **EDA**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/data-analyst-jobs/DataAnalyst.csv')\ndf.head(2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> <h3>Installing</h3>\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install sweetviz","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 3 main functions for creating reports in **SweetViz**:</br>\n\n1.analyze(...)\n\n2.compare(...)\n\n3.compare_intra(...)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">1. **Analyze**\n\nTo analyze a single dataframe, simply use the analyze(...) function, then the show_html(...) function:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sweetviz as sv\ndata_analyst_report = sv.analyze(df)\ndata_analyst_report.show_html('Analyst.html')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">By Running the following line, is gonna take you to a new html page,which has been created & it'll gonna  save  automatically in the following folder,in which you are running the Code.ðŸ“Š","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Just to show you guys, how the **HTML** file look like i'm gonna import the **HTML** file here.Let's see how it looks like","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame(src = 'Analyst.html',width=1000,height=600)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":">And here we go, as you can see above, our report of EDA is ready and contains a lot of\ninformation for all the attributes.

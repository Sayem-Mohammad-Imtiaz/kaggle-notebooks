This is the classification problem.\n\nIt is intended to be an end-to-end example of what a data science and machine learning proof of concept might look like.\n\n\n## What is Classification? \n\nCategorizing the given data into the classes wheather the date is structured or unstructured. Classification with two outcomes is binary classification, Classification with more than two outcomes is Multi class Classification and the problem pattern belongs to more than one class is Multi label Classification. \n\nIn this notebook we are dealing with the binary classification Problem.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What we are gonna do throughout the notebook?\n\nWe have the dataset of heart disease UCI using this we are going to predict whether the patient have the heart disease or not. We will approach the problem step by step using this cycle.\n\n<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/6608/1*Gf0bWgr2wst9A1XR5gakLg.png'/>\n\nFig: 6 step machine learning modelling framework.\n\nMainly the topics that are involved in this notebook are:\n\n* Explanatory Data Analysis: The process of going through the data set and finding more of it.\n* Model Training: Creating the model using the train data set to predict the correct outcome using test data set.\n* Model Evaluation: Evaluating a model using problem specific evaluation matrices.\n* Model Comparision: Comparing the several different model to predict the best one.\n* Model fine-tuning: Once we get the best model for our problem, how can we tune/improve it?\n* Feature Importance: We are working to predict whether someone has heart disease or not? so we need to find that are there anything that are more important for prediction?\n* Cross Validation: We know that cross validation is the one of best choice to predict from the unseen data because the model can be trained with the many folds during the training. It is way better choice than a random selection.\n* Reporting what we've found: Presenting our work to others who are not familiar with these technical lines.\n\nWe will dive into them one by one. We are using following libraries:\n### Data Analysis\n* Numpy\n* Pandas\n* Matplotlib\n* Seaborn\n\n### Machine Learning and modelling\n* Scikit-learn\n\nSo to understand this notebook well you need to better familiar with the above mentioned Python Libraries. At the end of the notebook we are going to successfully predict the heart disease patient using the given features in the data set. We we also know that which colum matter the most to predict the disease.\n\n\n<img src = 'https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/Xy6xeK3Wwr/sizes/heart-attack-ai-oxford_resize_md.jpg'/>\n\n\n\n\n\n## 1.Problem Definition\n\nWe know that we are prediction whether the patient have heart disease or not. This is based on the binary class classification because it is only based of 'True' or 'False'. We're going to be using a number of differnet features (pieces of information) about a person. Our main goal is:\n\n`Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?`\n\n\n## 2.Data\n\nThe original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. Attributes (also called features) are the variables what we'll use to predict our target variable. Attributes and features are also referred to as independent variables and a target variable can be referred to as a dependent variable.\n\n**We use the independent variables to predict our dependent variable.**\n\nOr in our case, the independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease.\n\n## 3.Evaluation\n\nAs machine learning is all about experimentation, we no need to worry about our first failure. Those who want to be successful in the very first attempt i think they don't have the long lasting career. So, we have to evaluate our project until we get the more nearly predicting output. Patence is the most important key in those moments.\n\n'If we approach near to 95% accuracy we will be near to the future prediction. So, stay calm and tune your model to get the more better accuracy.'\n\n\n## 4.Features\n\nFeatures plays the most important role to predict something that we don't know. So a good features always plays a better role for prediction.\n\nTo understand the features in a better way let's create a data dictionary.\n\n### Data Dictionary \n\nThis data dictionary describes about the data that we are dealing with. We don't describes those data that i am not going to use during the modelling process.\n\nThe following are the features that we are going to use to predict target variable(heart disease or no heart disease):\n1. age - age in years\n2. sex - (1=male,0=female)\n3. cp = chest pain\n    * Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n    * Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n    * Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n    * Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n    * anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n    * serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n    * above 200 is cause for concern\n6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n    * '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes\n7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n    * 0: Nothing to note\n    * 1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n        * can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n        * signals non-normal heart beat\n    * 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy\n        * Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n    * looks at stress of heart during excercise\n    * unhealthy heart will stress more\n11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n    * 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n    * 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n    * 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n    * colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n    * the more blood movement the better (no clots)\n13. thal - thalium stress result\n    * 1,3: normal\n    * 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now\n    * 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising\n14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)\n\n\n## Preparing Tools\n\nPython doesnot provide all the support to solve these types of problems. So, before starting the project we have to import the necessarily library to do such type of tasks. I am going to import the necessary library in the beginning and i will import the other libraries when the problem arieses and python can not tackle it.\n\n* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysis\n* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical operations\n* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) / [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for plotting and visualizations\n* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for machine learning","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Regular explanatory data analysis and plotting libraries.\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n\n#models\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n\n#model evaluators\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,classification_report,precision_score,recall_score,f1_score,plot_roc_curve","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Data\nThere are many different formats of data and there are lots of tools to visualize those data.

One such measure is the concentration ratio. This is often used by industrial economists who are interested in the degree to which the largest n firms dominate a particular industry. \nApplied to a sporting context, the concentration ratio can be used to measure the proportion of a season’s points won by the top n sides within a k team league (where n<k).\n\nformula : $ \\frac{\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{k} S_{i}}{\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n} S_{i}} $ \n\nSi denotes the share of points enjoyed by the ith team.\nIf we plot this concentration ratio\nTwo things emerge. First, the dominance of the top three sides varies from year to year as their strength changes relative to the rest of the league. Starting at a given peak, the top sides set a standard of play which strongly differentiates them from the rest of the division. In subsequent seasons, the chasing pack revise their own level of play (usually by recruiting better quality players and changes in tactics), enabling some degree of ‘catch-up’.  Eventually, the top sides raise the bar again and the process continues. Second, there is an underlying increase in the dominance of the top three sides, the implication being that the Premiership is showing signs of falling competitiveness.  This may arise because the top sides are benefiting from playing in the Champions League and as a result are learning new tactics from outside the domestic league and in addition are acquiring the resources to hire even better quality players.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def comp(df,n):\n    a=[]\n    for i in df.league.unique():\n        for j in df.year.unique():\n

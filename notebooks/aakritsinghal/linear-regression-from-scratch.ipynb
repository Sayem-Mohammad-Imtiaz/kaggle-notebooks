Being a thrifty data expert, you want to get the best bang for your buck. \n\nImagine that you also have data from the car website [CarDekho](https://www.cardekho.com/), which has information on a wide variety of cars, including their price. You realize that you can use that data to make sure you get a good deal on a new car. In particular, you can figure out exactly how much you should pay for a specific type of car. This can be especially helpful if you run into a tricky car salesman! \n\nBut the question is how can you use the data to figure out how much you should pay? \n\nYou can use Linear Regression! \n\nLinear Regression is a method for discovering the relationship between two variables in the dataset, such as price of the car and the year it was made. Data Scientists rely on this method for solving a wide range of problems, especially when it comes to prediction. \n\nLet's get started. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"d-zYd2aI8Lt4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Fetching the Data \n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"jaxKGdjzGj9e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use a very common data science library called Pandas to load the dataset into this notebook.

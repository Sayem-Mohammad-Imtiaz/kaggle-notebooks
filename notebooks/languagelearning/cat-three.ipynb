if yes explain.\n\n### Answer\n\nAcording to me there is supervised machine learning is possible as \"Supervised learning\" is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.\n\n**Y = f(X)**\n\nThe goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.\n\nIt is called supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\n\n**> If we notice there is feature as study time and if we see correlation between study time and grades they are highly related from this feature we can predict a student's grades that whether if a student study more will he get more marks or not.**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

The first thing to note about this dataset is that the data is largely qualitative. Given this, we will have to look for opportunities that allow us to more effectively and easily model our data.\n\n### 3.1 Career Satisfaction\nCareerSatisfaction is the target for our predictions and modelling. It is a qualitative column. The question in the survey for CareerSatisfaction reads:\n\n> **\"Overall, how satisfied are you with your career thus far?\"**\n\nSurvey respondants were given the following options to select from when answering this question:\n\n* Extremely dissatisfied\n* Moderately dissatisfied\n* Slightly dissatisfied\n* Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied\n* Slightly satisfied\n* Moderately satisfied\n* Extremely satisfied\n\nFor the purpose of this assignment, we'll convert these 7 qualitative values to integers 1 through 7, where 1 represents 'Extremely dissatisfied' and 7 represents 'Extremely satisfied'.

The reason for this decision is brevity: if we were to use qualitative data, such as country, degree, favourite frameworks, etc., we would need to perform coding of that data into some workable, quantifiable format. While not impossible, it is out of the scope of this assignment.\n\nThat said, the question set selected might suprise us with useful insight into how respondants with low or high Career Satisfaction might evaluate certain job characteristics.\n\nThe question set reads: \n\n>** \"Imagine that you are assessing a potential job opportunity. Please rank the following aspects of the job opportunity in order of importance (by dragging the choices up and down), where 1 is the most important and 10 is the least important\"**\n\nThe 10 options provided to the user to order include:\n\n1. AssessJob1: The industry that I'd be working in\n* AssessJob2: The financial performance or funding status of the company or organization\n* AssessJob3: The languages, frameworks, and other technologies I'd be working with\n* AssessJob4: The compensation and benefits offered\n* AssessJob5: The office environment or company culture\n* AssessJob6: The opportunity to work from home/remotely\n* AssessJob7: Opportunities for professional development\n* AssessJob8: The diversity of the company or organization\n* AssessJob9:  How widely used or impactful the product or service I'd be working on is\n* AssessJob10: Salary and/or bonuses\n\nThese columns contain a value between 1 and 10 that represents how the respondant ranked the importance of the factor.\n\n### 3.3 Columns of Interest (COI)\nWe now have our COI selected. A couple of interesting points already:\n\n* The average value for Career Satisfaction is 5.2, or 'Slightly satisfied'\n* On average most respondants ranked this factor as having greater important: AssessJob9: 'How widely used or impactful the product or service I'd be working on is'\n* On average most respondants ranked this factor as having lesser importance: AssessJob5: 'The office environment or company culture'"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"973eb3e2ba4932aa49d3a228f6ecd1d1c0029fcc"},"cell_type":"code","source":"columns_of_interest = ['AssessJob1','AssessJob2','AssessJob3','AssessJob4','AssessJob5','AssessJob6','AssessJob7','AssessJob8','AssessJob9','AssessJob10','CareerSatisfaction','CareerSatRating']\nselected_columns = df[columns_of_interest].dropna()\nselected_columns.columns = ['Industry', 'FinancialStatus','Frameworks','Benefits','Culture','Remote','PD','Diversity','Impact','Salary','CareerSatisfaction','CareerSatRating']\ntarget_column = selected_columns['CareerSatRating']\nprediction_columns = ['Industry', 'FinancialStatus','Frameworks','Benefits','Culture','Remote','PD','Diversity','Impact','Salary']\nselected_columns[prediction_columns].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4fdf134f00fc3ec5b05e36960365bebfd73829b1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"selected_columns[prediction_columns].info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"3391be66101e7f0c2ab26ab9731bc83578fe450d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"selected_columns[prediction_columns].boxplot(figsize=(18,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4b98f30d5c830df456bf87155926711d78b04d50","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"selected_columns[prediction_columns].hist(figsize=(18,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"fde19429b0ebe52c8f227c6ddadcf0048b38c9e3","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"selected_columns.groupby('CareerSatRating').hist(figsize=(18,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"05c02aec611601da9813dcb12f4d12387ee1aa4c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.0 Modelling, Training, and Predictions"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"21e4572a5973fbc0bf4f169b9dbb01d9ca47e5cf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nnp.random.seed(0)\n\nselected_columns['is_train'] = np.random.uniform(0, 1, len(selected_columns)) <= .75\nselected_columns.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cba061b906cd9c27f2a221d8021d78bef8d93f36"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create two new dataframes, one with the training rows, one with the test rows\ntrain = selected_columns[selected_columns['is_train']==True]\ntest = selected_columns[selected_columns['is_train']==False]\n# Show the number of observations for the test and training dataframes\nprint('Number of observations in the training data:', len(train))\nprint('Number of observations in the test data:',len(test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"05b48ec172b9c9e5f41a9f0eeffd0b3a858567ca"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a list of the feature column's names\nfeatures = selected_columns.columns[:10]\nfeatures","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"345775bb6980272301bda48b5b523857d243ceca"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# train['ConvCareerSatisfaction'] contains the actual species names.

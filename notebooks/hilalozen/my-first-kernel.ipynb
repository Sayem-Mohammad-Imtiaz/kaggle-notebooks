We consider good wine as the quality is greater than 6.5.\n\nfixed acidity means most acids involved with wine\nvolatile acidity shows the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste\ncitric acid found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines\nresidual sugar is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter\nchlorides means the amount of salt in the wine\nfree sulfur dioxide shows the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion\ntotal sulfur dioxide is amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine\ndensity is the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol\npH describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**IMPORTING THE LIBRARIES**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

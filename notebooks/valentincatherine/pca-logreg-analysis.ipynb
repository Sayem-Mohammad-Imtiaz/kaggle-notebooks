A detailed report will then be provided about the type of cells that were seen, including any suggestion that the cells might be cancer. It is important to remember that having a lump or mass does not necessarily mean that it is cancerous; many fine needle aspiration biopsies reveal that suspicious lumps or masses are benign (non-cancerous) or cysts. Aspirate samples may be described as one of the following types:\n\n* **Inadequate/insufficient:** The sample taken was not adequate to exclude or confirm a diagnosis.\n* **Benign:** There are no cancerous cells present. The lump or growth is under control and has no spread to other areas of the body.\n* **Atypical/indeterminate, or suspicious of malignancy:** The results are unclear. Some cells appear abnormal but are not definitely cancerous. A surgical biopsy may be required to adequately sample the cells.\n* **Malignant:** The cells are cancerous, uncontrolled and have the potential or have spread to other areas of the body.\n\nIn our dataset, only aspirate samples which are **only** Benign and Malignant are described\n\nNow we have understand the dataset, let's do some **preprocessing** !

It is an analysis of the player’s traits and the game overall. FIFA is the most popular video game and by 2019 it has sold 282.4 million copies. It is available in 51 countries. It is also listed in Guinness book of world record. The Guardian called the series “The slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around.” FIFA was founded in 1904 to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. Headquartered in Zürich, its membership is now comprises 211 national associations.\n\nI have chosen this data because by analyzing it, many interesting facts could be found about Football.Also we can conduct similar analysis for any sports if similar kind of information is given. The source of this dataset is from kaggle and covid data is from a website name ourworldindata.org. \n\nMany of us plays this game and would be interesting know some insights from it. Also by finding some players information like nationality, overall score, potential we could predict the best player in future. In this report we didn’t predict the best player but the insights found from this analysis could be useful.\n\nIn this report we clean and inspect the data first and some findings like how many different nationality players have, how many different clubs are there in FIFA 2020. We also find some insights about players like player's BMI, player's under 20 having the highest score, player with the highest potential but lowest overall score and so on. Below is the coding for analyzing the data. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Loading the libraries and csv file first, "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd    #importing pandas library\nimport numpy as np     #importing numpy library \n\ndf = pd.read_csv(r\"/kaggle/input/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset/players_20.csv\") #reading the csv file\n\ndf.shape #inspecting the row and column number ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Inspecting the data below and checking all the column names #finding out all the column names,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in df.columns: \n    print(col)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A function to find of the index of desired columns index,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def column_index(df, df_cols): \n    cols = df.columns.values\n    ref = np.argsort(cols)\n    return ref[np.searchsorted(cols,df_cols,sorter=ref)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"column_index(df, ['age','club','contract_valid_until','dob','file','height_cm','international_reputation', #finding index of all the desired column\n                  'joined','long_name','player_positions','nationality','overall','potential','short_name','weight_kg'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Filtering the data by the columns necessary for the analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_fifa = df[['age','club','contract_valid_until','dob','height_cm','international_reputation','joined','long_name','player_positions','nationality','overall','potential','short_name','weight_kg']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"having a look at the filtered data,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_fifa.head(10) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"having a look at the range of rows and data type of the variables"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_fifa.info()  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some columns with date are not in datetime format, converting them into time format."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"timefmt = \"%Y-%m-%d\" #converting some object data type to datetime as they are dates \ndf_fifa['joined'] = pd.to_datetime(df_fifa['joined'], format = timefmt, errors='coerce')\ndf_fifa['dob'] = pd.to_datetime(df_fifa['dob'], format = timefmt, errors='coerce')\n\n\ntimefmt = \"%Y\" \ndf_fifa['contract_valid_until'] = pd.to_datetime(df_fifa['contract_valid_until'], format = timefmt, errors='coerce')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After changing the data type, having a look at the data again to see if they have changed"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_fifa.info()  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finding out the columns with null values,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_fifa.columns[df_fifa.isnull().any()].tolist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Replacing the null values with zero."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df = df_fifa.fillna(value= 0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***Question 1 : How many different nationality and clubs are there in FIFA 20 ?***\n\nAnswer : There are 162 different nationlities and 698 different club in FIFA 20.

Same for the players who has high potential but low overall scores. Clubs can focus on these players and train them to have the best outcome. More players play in centre back so the new players can be trained to play in other position. Offensive positions are not that popular amoung players. Further investigation could be done to see which club is the best since it has two of best players with highest international reputation.

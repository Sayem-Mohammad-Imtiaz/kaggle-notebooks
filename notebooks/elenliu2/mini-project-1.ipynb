Some places are inconvenient to live but popular for tourism, and vise versa.\n* For future directions, I want to look into different cities to see if the pattern retains. I'm also curious about the comparison between housing prices in 2016 (which is this dataset) and pricing in 2021. I also want to find a better way to visualize my data, because only plotting half of them out already slows my computer down. it takes about 10 seconds to display whatever words I type in now.","metadata":{}}]}

which has around of 290 rows and talks primarily about two world famous universities Harvardx and MITx. It contains all the information of the courses which had been launched so far through this online portal. I performed an analysis over this dataset and tried to find out which is most popular university over other in terms of higher audience based on computer science subject.\n\na) I have found many interesting points while analyzing this dataset such as Harvardx launched only 1 basic programming course from 2012 to 2016 in computer science subject where as MITx launched multiple courses throughout this period.\n\nb) 2015 was the prominent year in terms of launching courses as well as reached to a milestone of targetting 300k students by Harvardx and 250k by MITx.\n\nc) Harvardx gathered audience from Non Degree as well as Higher Degree as it launched basic programming course in computer science where MITx gathered mostly the Higher Degree students as MITx launched more number of skills' oriented courses.

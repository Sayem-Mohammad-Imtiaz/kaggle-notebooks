The first heart sound is generated by the closure of the inflow valves (mitralis and tricuspid) and marks the beginning of systole, when blood is pushed out to from the heart to the body and lungs. The second heart sound is generated by the closure of the outflow valves (aortic and pulmonary) and marks the beginning of diastole, the slightly longer phase when the heart is refilled.\n\nA heart *murmur* is a low-frequency sound created by turbulent flow over the valves. Especially during systole, it can be a normal finding, created by the high speed flow in aorta. A murmur can also be a sign of malfunction of the valves, such as *stenosis*, when the valve is too narrow and tight, or *insufficiency*, when there is leakage over a valve that fails to close.\n\nA *third or forth heart sound* is thought to be due to abnormal blood flow in the ventricles and is a sign of advanced heart disease. They have been described from the beginning of days, from the time when the stethoscope wasn't invented and doctors listened with ear-to-chest. \n\nMy experience from med school is that extra heart sounds don't really exist any more - at least not outside of cardiac surgery. When a faint extra sound was found on the wards, it was mandatory for everyone to go there and listen, and sometimes the sound we heard was imagined rather than real. Even being more generous than that, most would agree that extra heart sounds are rarer and less important than murmurs by an order of magnitude. I have certainly never based any clinical decision on their presence or not.\n\nSome of the recordings under ''extrahls'' do indeed have extra sounds, but I am not sure that they correspond to the classical third and fourth sound, especially as an extra peak is not seen on the amplitude graph. Instead, I believe many of them are a split second sound, which is created when the aortic and pulmonary valves don't close exactly at the same time. (This is normal when you hold your breath, but can sometimes be a sign of lung disease.) More problematic is that many recordings under \"normal\" had similar extra sounds, and I think that these in many cases are caused by the recording technique (which is after all different from ear-to-chest on which third heart sounds were defined). \n\nI went back and forth between recordings a few times, but the distinction did not become any clearer for me. As the category \"extrahls\" therefore seems to be poorly defined I decided to combine it with \"normal\".\n\nIn addition, 40 and 55 which are murmur. In fact, 55 is identical to 66 below, which was labelled murmur.

A person with a murmur like 83 or 88 either has well-known cardiac disease, or needs to be sent to hospital straight away. (They are called grade 5 or 6 murmurs, when you can feel them on the skin, or hear them anywhere on the chest.) \n\nWe will see that our model will struggle to identify the much more common milder murmurs, and many more examples of this would have been needed.

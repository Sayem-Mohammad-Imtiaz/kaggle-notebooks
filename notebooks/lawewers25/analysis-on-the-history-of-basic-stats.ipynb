Offense or Defense\n\n## Introduction\nIn baseball, the ultimate goal for a hitter is to reach base by base hit, measured by batting average (walks help but for this notebook the focus will be base hits) in order to score runs, and for pitchers is to prevent runs from scoring, measured by earned run average. Both the offensive and defensive aspects of baseball are rewarded for and punished in different ways based on their performance during a game.

The [MLB schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_schedule) has not always been 162 games a season with 30 teams playing. These increase in teams and games is a significant cause of statistics increasing but not the only reason. The first spike in home runs on the 19th Century Era was result of the pitching mound being pushed back to the length today of 60 feet 6 inches. During the Dead Ball Era, pitching a defense was emphasized. This obvious due to the low amount of league wide home runs hit. In the transition into the Lively Ball Era, home runs increase immediately. Offense began taking over as the main focus of the league in this era. Home runs took a dive when World War II. Many of the [MLB's best players](http://www.baseballinwartime.com/those_who_served/those_who_served_atoz.htm) took up arms and went to war. With most of the best players gone, older players or less experienced players took their places after [Franklin D. Roosevelt requested Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the commissioner of baseball](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/01/fdr-franklin-roosevelt-letter-to-mlb-commissioner-kenesaw-landis). Once World War II was over, the MLB began to integrate itself. With the addition of amazing talent like Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby, home runs increased again. Home runs increased during the Expansion Era due to the addition of four more teams. With more personal going to bat than ever before home runs were bound to increase. The green line on the graph represents when the mound was lowered and the strike zone shrunk for the 1969 season. It was believed by the league that the pitchers were too good and had too much of an upper hand against hitters. During the Free Agency Era there is a massive drop in the 1981 season. [This was due to a players strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Major_League_Baseball_strike). Some of the league’s top hitters were involved in the strike and some games were cancelled, causing the dip in home runs. 2005 was the first year of the Steroid Era. There was an enormous increase in home runs. With steroids running through the league, players' power increased, increasing the amount of home runs hit.\n\n### Strikeouts\nIn early baseball, strikeouts dominated league statistics. In the 19th Century and the Dead Ball Eras strikeouts were abnormally high compared to the growth of total strikeouts. This can be attributed to stacked pitching talent and poorer hitting mechanics compared to today's hitters. Another spike occurred in the Expansion Era due to the increase of players with the addition of two teams to both the National and American Leagues. Probably the most interesting observation is the increase in modern day baseball and its comparison to the amount of home runs hit.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9866af4f6e341600d5f9b5a14d2c23bea580e2c3","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"5e0b4c4e-77e3-4181-846c-edc61b6cd642","_execution_state":"idle"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"hr_so = pd.merge(total_hr, df_so, on = 'year')\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (15, 8), sharex = True)\n\nsns.regplot(x=\"year\", y=\"total_hr\", truncate=False, data=hr_so, ax=ax1, color='red')\nax1.set_xlabel('Year')\nax1.set_ylabel('Home Runs')\nax1.set_title('League Home Run Totals')\nax1.set_ylim([0,6000])\n\nsns.regplot(x=\"year\", y=\"so\", truncate=False, data=hr_so, ax=ax2, color='blue')\nax2.set_xlabel('Year')\nax2.set_ylabel('Strikeouts')\nax2.set_title('League Strikeout Totals')\nax2.set_ylim([0,40000])\nNone","execution_count":22},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0b803135e58042a992f7b9e8c54de54c948e9a25","_cell_guid":"d5a6b2b0-d97a-4ea9-a607-2049bbc390c0"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What To Takeaway\nWhen comparing total strikeouts and home runs share a relationship over the history of baseball.

In the 19th Century the batting averages increased when the league decided to push the mound back. Giving the hitters more time to react to a pitch proved to be an advantage for the hitters. Once the Dead Ball Era began the averages plummeted in due part to an increased focus in pitching and hitting. This can support the idea that after the mound was pushed back, and offense dominated the sport, teams over compensated by increasing their defensive ability before their offensive ability. After the Dead Ball Era there is a spike in the Lively Ball Era, but for the most part the league average levels out to around .250.\n\n### Earned Run Average\nThe first thing noticed in the ERA graph is how it correlates with the league's batting average in the early years of the game. Earned Run Average, or ERA, is the statistic that reveals how many earned runs a pitcher allows for every nine-innings pitched. This statistic is a good indication on how well the putcher prevents runs from scoring, therefore, the lower the ERA the better. In the early eras of baseball contact hitting was the major philosophy for hitters. Just getting base hits was the main priority, so this is how many teams scored their runs. Therefore, batting average and ERA appear to have a relationship with each other. However, the relationship is not so apparent later. After World War II, you can see ERA increasing over time, but batting average is staying the same. There appears to be more of a relationship with home runs than batting average. As home runs go up, ERA goes up, and vice versa.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"32ea5880908e627d40b8abc4770f1cc28995f119","trusted":false,"_cell_guid":"6c9c6fdd-5e3f-45f8-93ae-cd8782c4aa04","_execution_state":"idle"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize = (15, 8), sharex = True)\n\nsns.regplot(x=\"year\", y=\"avg\", truncate=False, data=total_avg, ax=ax1, color='red')\nax1.set_xlabel('Year')\nax1.set_ylabel('Batting Average')\nax1.set_title('League Batting Average')\n\nsns.regplot(x=\"year\", y=\"yr_era\", truncate=False, data=df_era, ax=ax2, color='blue')\nax2.set_xlabel('Year')\nax2.set_ylabel('Earned Run Average')\nax2.set_title('League Earned Run Average')\nNone","execution_count":24},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3d5fecd28cec03ca66d14ecb7951a8862ed0499c","_cell_guid":"6d292e2e-d500-4dda-ba94-c67855184784"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What To Take Away\nThe most interesting aspect of this comparison between average and ERA is how the relationship dissolves over time and ERA gains more of a relationship with home runs.

With the culture change in baseball, the statistics recorded year to year have changed since baseball began. Hitters are shooting for the long ball and pitchers are aiming to ring them on a called third strike more so than ever. Examining the data from era to era provides insight on how events from society and changed in the rules of the game can affect stats as well. With all these changes, there are a few questions that must be asked moving forward.\n- Can players from different eras really be compared to each other?\n- What caused the culture of baseball to have a hitting philosophy based on contact shift to power?\n- Has the culture shift improved offensive production?\n\n### Modern Day\nIn regard to how dominance in power hitting of modern day baseball, has swinging for the fences improved offensive production? The data shows that there has been a decline in offense as more and more hitters thirst for power. Pitchers' strikeout numbers are improving and ERAs are dropping while hitters’ averages fall along with their home runs numbers. Is it more beneficial for hitters to focus on contact rather than power? Maybe. Maybe not. But the numbers show the age of long ball goes to the pitchers.","execution_count":null}],"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"},"file_extension":".py","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.1"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4}

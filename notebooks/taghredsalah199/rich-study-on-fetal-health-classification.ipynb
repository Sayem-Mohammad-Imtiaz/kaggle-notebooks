The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.\n\nIn light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n\nData\nThis dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:\n\n- Normal\n- Suspect\n- Pathological\n\n______________________________________\n##### In this notebook, we will answer the following questions :\nQ : How do uterine contractions effects the fetal health?\n\nQ: What is the relationship between Baseline Fetal Heart Rate and uterine contractions for Pathological fetal?\n\nQ : Can uterine contractions and fetal movement express the fetal heath spacially Pathological type of fetal? \n\nQ : Can Fetal heart rate monitoring of short-term variation (STV) has a relationship with fetal health in terms of baseline value?\n\nQ :  What is the relationship between severe decelerations and uterine contractions in each type of fetal health?\n\nQ : Does mean value of short term variability has a relationship with fetal health type in term of uterine contractions?

No matter if you want to create interactive, live or highly customized plots python has an excellent library for you.\n\n**Matplotlib** from beginners in data science to experienced professionals building complex data visualizations, matplotlib is usually the default visualization Python library data scientists turn to.\nmatplotlib is known for the high amount of flexibility it provides as a 2-D plotting library in Python.Matplotlib supports all the popular charts (lots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, error charts, scatterplots, etc.) right out of the box. There are also extensions that you can use to create advanced visualizations like 3-Dimensional plots, etc.\nWhat I personally like about matplotlib is that because it’s so flexible, it lets the user control aspects of the visualization at the most granular level, from a single line or dot in the graph to the entire chart. This means you can customize it at the highest levels.\n\n**Seaborn** is built on top of matplotlib and provides a very simple yet intuitive interface for building visualizations. When using Seaborn, you will also notice that many of the default settings in the plots work quite well right out of the box.The first unique feature of Seaborn is that it is designed in such a way that you write way lesser code to achieve high-grade visualizations. Here is an example of this simplicity. Notice how we can create a complex visualization with just a single line of plotting code.The second useful feature of Seaborn is that it supports a plethora of advanced plots like categorical plotting (catplot), distribution plotting using kde (distplot), swarm plot, etc. right out of the box. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib, it is highly compatible with it. So that means when building visualizations, you can start with advanced plots that seaborn already supports and then customize them as much as you want with the help of matplotlib.\n\n**Bokeh** is a library designed to generate visualizations that are friendly on the web interface and browsers. And that’s what this visualization library specifically targets.You will also notice that the visualizations generated from Bokeh are interactive in nature, which basically means you can convey information in a more intuitive way through your plots.Bokeh supports unique visualizations like Geospatial plots, Network graphs, etc. right out of the box. If you want to show these visualizations in a browser, there are options available to export them and you can also use it through JavaScript itself.\n\n**Altair** is a declarative library for data visualization. Its principle is that rather than focusing on the code part, one should focus on the visualization part and write as less code as possible and still be able to create beautiful and intuitive plots.Since Altair uses a declarative style to create plots, it becomes very easy and quick to iterate through visualizations and experiments at a rapid pace when using this library.\n\n**Plotly** this data visualization library is by far my go-to library whenever I want to create visualizations that need to be highly interactive for the user. Plotly is highly compatible with Jupyter Notebook and Web Browsers. This means whatever interactive plots you create can easily be shared in the same manner with your teammates or end-users.Plotly supports a gamut of plots right from basic chart types, Seaborn-like beautiful and advanced plots, 3-D plots, Map-based visualizations, scientific plots, etc.Plotly’s plots can also support animation capabilities as well.\n\n**ggplot** is the Python version of the famous ggplot2 of R and the Grammer of Graphics language.  ggplot is also a declarative style library like Bokeh but is also tightly coupled with Pandas. This means you can easily build visualizations using your Pandas dataframe itself.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Information about Dataset(Fatal Police Shootings in the US)\n\n# Fatal police shootings in the US since 2015 with additional US census data\n\nThe 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2015, The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty.\nIt's difficult to find reliable data from before this period, as police killings haven't been comprehensively documented, and the statistics on police brutality are much less available. As a result, a vast number of cases go unreported.\n\nThe Washington Post is tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as \"Killed by police\" and \"Fatal Encounters\". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.\n\nThere are four additional datasets. These are US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, and racial demographics.\n\nSource of census data:\nhttps://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font color = \"blue\" >\n    Plot Contents:\n        \n   1.

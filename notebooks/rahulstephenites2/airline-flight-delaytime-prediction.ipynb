Don't we want to focus only on not canceled flights, on flights with a departure and a (late) arrival time? The answer is: No, we want them all! We don't want to lose data for our prediction. Every information, in this case, is important. For example cancellation reason \"Weather\" for a canceled flight. The flight themselves did not take place, that's right, but what about the consequences of the canceled flights? All the passengers need to get to their destinations, therefore they will be booked on the next flight or moreover the canceled flight will start in another timeshift and will probably block another's plains flight slot.

They need to be converted into numeric values to use a prediction model. There is a way to convert all categorical data into numeric values, its called One-Hot Encoding. This approach will line in all categorical values in separate columns, creates a new column and matches every occurrence of the categorical value with 1 or 0 for non-occurrences. You should take a deeper look into it\n\nAnother approach that is similar to the One-Hot encoding approach is included in the Pandas library and is called get_dummies(). This function converts categorical values into dummy/indicator values as well. In this case, all null value data are also converted and filled with 0 values.

These delays are basically causing the flight to be on air for more time,thus more fuel is being consumed.feul Consumption negatively effects the revene of the airline company.

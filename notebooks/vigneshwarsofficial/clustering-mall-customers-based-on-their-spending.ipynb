Spending Score is determined by the mall and the value of the spending score is between (1-100). The spending score near to 100 indicates that the customer has spent more money in the mall and when spending score is near 1 that indicates customer has spent less in the past in the mall. But the dataset does not tell in which category the customers belongs which indicates clustering should be performed.\n\n    When the mall advertisement team has to send advertisement to the customers on the new products and if the advertisement is send to 10000 customers there are chances that only 10% of the customers will buy the product which will not be efficient. Inorder to improve the efficiency the Customer data set should be analized to cluster the customers based on the annual income and spending score so that the the customers who spend more can be targetted first."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np #

Actually, when it comes to loan count, there are twice as many loans granted in the Phillipines as in the second country in the list (Kenya). This leads us to some important considerations, namely that:\n\n* Data with the widest possible coverage (World Bank, UN statistics, CIA World Factbook) is averaged out for each country and does not present a nuanced enough picture of the poverty levels. That is, in countries with high GINI coefficient, the average levels tell us little about the actual poverty-affected regions.\n* Local country data is presented in different formats. Every country measures different macroeconomic indicators (and sometimes measures the same indicators in different ways). This makes local data, that could eventually be joined together on global level, unreliable. Example: some countries may consider 'unemployment' as the number of working age individuals with no regular employment contract as unemployed. Other countries may consider 'unemployment' as individuals who do not have a regular employment contract AND are looking for employment (i.e. individuals who are not actively looking for jobs are not counted).\n\nTo address these problems, we can:\n\n* Take a local to global approach instead of vice versa. That is, we'll start by creating a model that captures the poverty variations within a country with good enough data. The model can then accept new data from other countries and scale up. The more countries, the more global the poverty score.\n* We can use census or survey data (where available) in order to derive our own indicators. Census and survey data usually presents us with quite raw indicators (e.g. number of family members, household income, etc.). However, census data is hard to come by.\n\nLuckily for us, there is an excellent dataset from the Philippine Statistics Authority published here on Kaggle. Not only is it segmented by region, but also contains data about the gender of the household head. This presents us with a great opportunity to focus on the most important region for Kiva and produce a working poverty model that could later on be scaled up. If our experiment is successful, more time could be invested to search and add further census data results from other countries and scale up the model. The dataset in question is the [Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES)](https://www.kaggle.com/grosvenpaul/family-income-and-expenditure).\n\n# Modelling Approach\nIn order to produce a model for the poverty score, we need to:\n\n1. Clean and prepare the the FIES data (e.g. convert categorical text fields to dummy variables, map regions to universal naming convention, etc.). We have already performed that work in [a separate notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/rossrco/philippines-fies-data-cleanup). At this point, we'll just import the results from that data transformation work.\n2. Map the province from the `region` field of the `kiva_loans.csv` data. This is a no easy task. The region field contains unstructured data that:\n    * Sometimes represents the name of the administrative center of a region and the region name (e.g. 'Tanjay, Negros Oriental')\n    * Sometimes represents the name of a population center (e.g. 'Plaridel-Cebulin')\n    * Sometimes contains very local names (e.g. the name of a village)\n    * Sometimes is missing\n\nHowever, the most common patter in the c.a. 160 000 Philippine loans is a name of a city, followed by a name of a province. We used that and some other heueristics to quickly map 150 000 loans to provinces in the Philippines. This allows us to join the poverty score results based on the FIES data to the loan data on province and household head gender. The mapping work for the province of each Kiva loan is performed in [a separate notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/rossrco/kiva-loans-philippines-region-matching). At this point, we'll just import the results from that work.\n\n3. We will attempt to predict a scaled version of the `household_income` field from the FIES data.\n4. We will try to reduce the number of input variables to the model but affect its accuracy as little as possible. __We will attempt to use 3-5 trivial variables. This will allow Kiva to add such variables to their loan application form and quickly get an estimate of the poverty level of each borrower.__\n5. We'll invert the income prediction to derive poverty. At first this will give us highly localized poverty scores (the scores will be relative to the highest income in the Philippines). However, if this initial model is scaled up with data from more countries, the poverty score will become relative to a more global income estimate. That is, the highest poverty score will be inverse to the highest incomes. This could produce a good global metric. Example: if a country has a low median income compared to a group  of developed nations, the local poverty score would be low. But as more incomes are added and the poverty model updated and scaled up, the poverty scores of that country will rise as higher incomes are introduced for comparison."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"loans_ph = pd.read_csv('../input/kiva-loans-philippines-transformed/kiva_loans_ph_transofrmed.csv', index_col = 0)","execution_count":255,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aaabb151-0504-4c78-a1bb-2a19d0cebed0","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"6dc19f5a17a93b534a8947ab60982c94b6860476","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"income_ph = pd.read_csv('../input/philippines-census-data-cleaned/philippines_census_data_cleaned.csv', index_col = 0)","execution_count":256,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"154654b9-1d53-48a5-8053-092ca648146e","_uuid":"7a3023a650eedd2b36a4aa658efac7ea15add422"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Selection\nWe'll start off by converting the region labels to one-hote encoded columns.

The relationship there is more than obvious - if the house head is single, they definitely don't have a partner.\n* The `household_income` column seems to correlate highly with the following fields:\n    * Expenses (food expenses, clothing expenses, house and water expenses, transport expenses, communication expenses and miscellaneous expenses)\n    * House rental value\n    * Number of ACs (air conditioning appliances)\n    * Number of electronic devices (DVDs, CD, stereo, etc.)\n    * Number of communication devices (landline or mobile phones)\n    * Number of vehicles (cars, tricycles, motorized boats)\n\nThose correlations seem to reasonably point towards the welfare of individuals.

This seems to be reasonable as low income families have predominantly food expenses that they need to limit due to their situation.\n* The `farming_gardening_expenses` has the second highest weight in both the AdaBoost and the Decision Tree models. This is also is in line with the general reasoning for poor households - they are mostly rural and within farming communities. Actually the Kiva dataset for loan themes contains a rural percentage column (supposedly for the same reason).\n* There are other important indicators of poverty which also seem in line with our intuition. Such are:\n    * Number of communication devices (or lack thereof)\n    * Agricultural household indicator\n    * House area\n    * House head employment status\n    * House head having partner indicator\n    * Number of family members\n\nIt's also interesting to note that the Linear Regression has placed high importance on the regions and the living conditons (the `no_roof`, `other_toilet`, `num_refrigerator`). Unfortunately we cannot simply use the region features because that would make the model harder to scale in the future (such a model will be basically a map of poverty-stricken regions).\n\nThe MLP regressor (at least in one of the dimensions if its matrix) has selected a mix of features, namely:\n\n* Expenses: `farming_gardening_expenses`\n* Demographics: `num_children_older_5`, `house_head_secondary_ed`, `house_head_tertiary_ed`\n* Living conditions: `house_ext_family`, `wall_material_quite_light`, `residential_block`, `roof_material_light`\n* Region: `armm`\n\nHere, we have some features that we can work with and some features that would be difficult to implement. One aspect of the MLP regressor that is disadvantageous for us is the difficulty in understanding its decision matrix (let's remember that these are the weights of just one perceptron out of 100 in the first layer). At least we get a partial confirmation that the `food_expenses` column is a very important feature.\n\n## Final Model Selection and Testing\n\nHaving a better understanding of the feature importances, the successful initial models and the validity of our approach, we can now proceed and derive the final model. To do that, we will:\n\n1. Select the model\n2. Select 3 features based on the following criteria:\n    * Feature weight\n    * Feature applicability (how easy would be for Kiva to integrate such a question into their loan application form)\n3. Retrain the model on the selected features.\n4. Test the model performance on the test set.\n\nWe'll start first by selecting the model. Based on the performance table, derived above, it would seem reasonable to select the Decision Tree model. Another good reason for choosing it is that decision trees are easily explainable.\n\nNext, we move on the the 3 features. Our choice is: `food_expenses`, `farming_gardening_expenses` and `agricultural_household`. We prefer the agricultural_household feature as it seems easier to apply in the field, however its weight is less than 1% of our model's prediction power, so we can drop it altogether.\n\nWe'll now produce the new featureset."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bf1b2e8d-27d8-4ad1-80a6-44d9d596177c","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"1fc23b98c578d674969ca1c96e55d6028862467e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"final_features = ['food_expenses', 'farming_gardening_expenses']\n\nX_train, X_test = X_train[final_features], X_test[final_features]\nX_train.head()","execution_count":273,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"719cd71e-da19-4708-a324-dd51fa52fd30","_uuid":"fbe5c3e0301f66752f5ab41d4f05c6ec717806df"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll now retrain our model."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0812fc48-000f-4962-aef2-1b7c03e96a2d","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"2b1a238d56a800d19b5154e1a67b345cbb15f0ff","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"final_clf = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 42)\nfinal_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":274,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"191bfc62-c7ac-4691-9f94-5a9dfa68aee5","_uuid":"4f62a7e7f6e570b9f23f5916b7d147ca764a617e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll now assess the performance after retraining (we are expecting a slight drop in performance because we limited ourselves to 2 features)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3609addf-a390-450b-bc79-042dd3a469eb","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"c5f4ac05fbd5e3476380ee7caa9fcec4de8cdfd5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"metrics = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['metric', 'value'])\n\nfor metric, scorer, i in zip(metric_names, scorers, range(len(metric_names))):\n    for set_type, set_data in zip(('train', 'test'), ([y_train, X_train], [y_test, X_test])):\n        metrics.loc[i] = [metric + '_' + set_type, scorer(set_data[0], final_clf.predict(set_data[1]))]\n\nmetrics","execution_count":275,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"55514c86-af94-41df-a21c-8f423c72dee9","_uuid":"98dc920c2deacc5e3e860a08f6aa35c5593363fb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll now visualize 3 levels of the decision tree:"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a4eeb6b-321e-4cd2-9829-79fa6e50b9ee","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"355e63ed24bb9422af3236d7c8f04becb607fc4f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.externals.six import StringIO  \nfrom IPython.display import Image as PImage  \nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nimport graphviz\nfrom subprocess import check_call\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont\n\nwith open('kiva_decision.dot', 'w') as f:\n     f = tree.export_graphviz(final_clf,\n                              out_file = f,\n                              max_depth = 3,\n                              feature_names = X_train.columns,\n                              rounded = True,\n                              filled = True)\n        \ncheck_call(['dot', '-Tpng', 'kiva_decision.dot', '-o', 'kiva_decision.png'])\n\nimg = Image.open('kiva_decision.png')\ndraw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\ndraw.text((10, 0),\n          'Kiva Decision Process For Poverty Score Assessment',\n          (0, 0, 255))\nimg.save('tree-out.png')\nPImage('tree-out.png')","execution_count":276,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d60bad7f-c09f-4d33-b978-00fee702d117","_uuid":"64f415d1029e1a48d0801140c619502106b51de3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll now create a prediction for all results and derive the poverty score.\n\n# Poverty Score\n\nAt this point the score is simply the inverse of the normalized `household_income`.

We did so as the Philippines accounts for the highest number of loans in the Kiva dataset. We used pre-processed data from the Filippino Famili Income and Expenditure Survey. We derived household income prediction based on the FIES data and inverted the normalized prediction to get a poverty score. We then joined the mean poverty score results to the Kiva loan dataset by gender and region.\n\nUnfortunately our current work doesn't cover other countries. That's why the potential future improvements on this work could be:\n\n* Identify and pre-process data for other regions (e.g. Kenya)\n* Derive the currently selected poverty predictors (food expenses and farming expenses)\n* Retrain the model as each new country is added and backpropagate the poverty scores\n\nThank you for your attention."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"166d1e62-d937-4245-ab82-1ae5973277f7","_uuid":"be2e2dda0b2c2a5de40c59a5f7361bbb78f92f50","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Members of the Lok Sabha are elected by an adult universal suffrage and a first-past-the-post system to represent their respective constituencies, and they hold their seats for five years or until the body is dissolved by the President on the advice of the council of ministers. The house meets in the Lok Sabha Chambers of the Sansad Bhavan, New Delhi.**\n\n\n**The maximum membership of the House allotted by the Constitution of India is 552 (Initially, in 1950, it was 500). Currently, the house has 543 seats which are made up by the election of up to 543 elected members and at a maximum. Between 1952 and 2020, 2 additional members of the Anglo-Indian community were also nominated by the President of India on the advice of the Government of India, which was abolished in January 2020 by the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019. The Lok Sabha has a seating capacity of 550.**\n\n\n**A total of 131 seats (24.03%) are reserved for representatives of Scheduled Castes (84) and Scheduled Tribes (47). The quorum for the House is 10% of the total membership. The Lok Sabha, unless sooner dissolved, continues to operate for five years for time being from the date appointed for its first meeting. However, while a proclamation of emergency is in operation, this period may be extended by Parliament by law or decree.**\n\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ad1e70dd399bb9d12db5cca1668d35bdac86caf84d8ebc529da37af577ed9485/68747470733a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f636f6d6d6f6e732f7468756d622f632f63322f496e6469616e5f47656e6572616c5f456c656374696f6e5f323031392e7376672f38303070782d496e6469616e5f47656e6572616c5f456c656374696f6e5f323031392e7376672e706e67)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Importing the Libraries**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:49:16.468408Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:49:16.468935Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:49:17.528705Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:49:16.468846Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:49:17.527788Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Loading the Files**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2 = pd.read_csv('../input/indian-candidates-for-general-election-2019/LS_2.0.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:49:31.808776Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:49:31.809136Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:49:31.830835Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:49:31.809105Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:49:31.829515Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Displaying the Data**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:49:43.424997Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:49:43.425505Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:49:43.474325Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:49:43.42546Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:49:43.47326Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.rename(columns={'CRIMINAL\\nCASES': 'criminal'}, inplace=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:50:34.37804Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:50:34.378408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:50:34.386373Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:50:34.378377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:50:34.384808Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:50:45.601033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:50:45.601387Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:50:45.608087Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:50:45.601359Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:50:45.606982Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Information about all the collumns in the Dataset**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-07T16:51:15.801849Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-07T16:51:15.802235Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-07T16:51:15.829906Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-07T16:51:15.802201Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-07T16:51:15.828804Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This Dataset is based on the Lok Sabha 2019 in India.

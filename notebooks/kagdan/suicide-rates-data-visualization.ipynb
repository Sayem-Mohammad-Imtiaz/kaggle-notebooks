The important thing here for me is to learn by expirience what insights are relevant and how to visualize them nicely. \n\nI'll update the notebook gradually, and am eager to get feedback and ideas from you guys (on everything - notebook organization & readability, code efficiency, visualiztion, data exploration). **Any input you'll give would be greatly appriciated!.**\n\nHope you'll find my learning expirience entertaining!

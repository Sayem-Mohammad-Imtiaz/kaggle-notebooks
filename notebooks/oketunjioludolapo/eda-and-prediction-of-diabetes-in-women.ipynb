Knowing and confirming the variables that contribute to this disease is one of the aims of this project. I want to  find out the variable(s) that are indicators of diabetes as this would be variables that other women would try to work on so that they don't get diagnosed with diabetes. Like a quote from one of my favourite movie says,\"If you know yourself and know your enemy,then there would be no reason to fight\". Likewise,if we know what to watch out for, we stand a better chance of being safe from it or detecting it early.\n\n### Information about the dataset\nThis dataset was recorded with information from female patients that has been diagnosed or not diagnosed with Diabetes. With the aid this machine learning project, females can know what to look out for in order not to have the ailment and they will also be able to get a preliminary diagnosis on their status. This data was gotten from females of Pima Indian heritage who were 21 years and above.\n\nThe dataset contains the following variables:\n\n1) Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant<br />\n2) Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test<br />\n3) BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)<br />\n4) SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)<br />\n5) Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)<br />\n6) BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)<br />\n7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction: is it inheditary? Depending on which part of the family it is, the values are different. The pedigree function of parents is different from that of uncles of grandparents,etc<br />\n8) Age: Age (years)<br />\n9) Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)\n\nIn order to further understand some of the variables, you can click on the below links\n\n. [BMI](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/english_bmi_calculator/bmi_calculator.html)<br />\n. [GLUCOSE](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/glucose-tolerance-test-non-pregnant)<br />\n. [INSULIN](https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/diabetes/diagnosing-diabetes)<br />\n\n\n\n**By the end of this project,i hope to have answers to the problem statement and to be able to build a model that can diagnose the patients correctly**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preprocessing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing Libraries to use for

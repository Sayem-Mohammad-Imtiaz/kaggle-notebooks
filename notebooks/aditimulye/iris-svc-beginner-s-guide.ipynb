Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.\n\nHere's a picture of the three different Iris types:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The Iris Setosa\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nurl = 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Kosaciec_szczecinkowaty_Iris_setosa.jpg'\nImage(url,width=300, height=300)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-26T16:46:59.768542Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-26T16:46:59.769143Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.202319Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-26T16:46:59.769038Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.20121Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The Iris Versicolor\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nurl = 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Iris_versicolor_3.jpg'\nImage(url,width=300, height=300)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.204147Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.204538Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.6322Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.204497Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.631139Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The Iris Virginica\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nurl = 'http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Iris_virginica.jpg'\nImage(url,width=300, height=300)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.634112Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.634419Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-26T16:47:01.251036Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-26T16:47:00.634389Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-26T16:47:01.249581Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.\n\nThe three classes in the Iris dataset:\n\n    * Iris-setosa (n=50)\n    * Iris-versicolor (n=50)\n    * Iris-virginica (n=50)\n\nThe four features of the Iris dataset:\n\n    * sepal length in cms\n    * sepal width in cms\n    * petal length in cms\n    * petal width in cms\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\niris = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/iris-flower-dataset/IRIS.csv\")\niris.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-26T16:47:01.253196Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-26T16:47:01.253829Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-26T16:47:02.149931Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-26T16:47:01.253784Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-26T16:47:02.148343Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are just 5 columns and out of which one is the predicted (target) column.\nLet us see how well are the other columns related to the target one!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's visualize the data and get started!\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nTime to put your data viz skills to the test!

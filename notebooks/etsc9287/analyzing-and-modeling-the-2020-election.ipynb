Rural areas, represented by the smallest data points, are nearly all a shade of red, especially in middle and eastern America.  There also exists a pattern of the greatest Republican shifts occuring in Southern Texas near the border while the greatest Democratic shifts occur in the populous upper east coast which includes New York and New Jersey.\n\nOverall, this map tells a story of a country where solid red areas have shifted even further red while solid blue areas shift even further blue, illustrating the partisan conviction of many areas of the country even compared to 2016."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

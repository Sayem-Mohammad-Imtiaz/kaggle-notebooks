However, we then have something like a jump in the charges leaving an empty area and then another pattern resembling the lower one, but with less density. Then we have another jump and another similar behavior but with a lower density than the previous two. \nMy initial guess is this has to do with how insurance companies work; that insurance payments jumps in cost from a certain package to another one.  \n3- Charges-children plot:  \nWe see that the charges are somehow fairly distributed between the families having 0-3 children, with some outliers of course. Charges drops for families having more than 3 children, which is very interesting. Do larger families live healthier lives than those with less children? Or maybe they have no time or resources to take a very good care of themselves so they neglect some health issues, unless it is very urgent, compared to those with smaller families who have better chances of taking much care about themselves?  \nNow, the above chart indicates that even though most of the younger generation have low average medical charges, as expected, some, on the other hand, have high charges. This most probably is not related to children, as those younger-agers don't seem to have children as shown in the plot below between the age-children categories.  So, some of the younger generation are being charged with high medical charges, same as those of 50 years and older. And as we are going to see later on, those are of the smokers = yes category.  \n4-charges-bmi plot:  \nNow this is a very interesting plot. Here we see two distributions of the data:  \nOne horizontal, which is the major one as obvious from the contour plot, and another less-dense diagonal one, which I believe is the more logical one, with the health charges increasing with the increase of the bmi index all the way to obesity.  \nThe horizontal line is centered around 30 bmi, close to the accepted values, indicating that those people with average weight suffer less health problems than those overweight.  \nHowever, there is some proportion of those who are really overweight but with small insurance charges. This could be due to either:  \n     1- those people having no medical problems,  \n     2- or they still young of age, which is very common these days, so the health risks of their overweight has not yet manifested,   \n     3-or they have not the financial ability to take a good care of themselves and pay high medical insurance rates.  \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7683da295db91c31b5916e37109fd20ecba1e45f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To further check my young-age/few-children assumption, I plot these two categories together using a joint KDE plot to have a better visualization.

This makes it much easier for the system to predict them correctly.  \nNevertheless, the model seems to have missed a big chunk of the smoker category only 66% accurate.  \nInterestingly, when I ran the same model but without class_weight, the results were much better, only 5 missed from the non-smoker category and with accuracy of 99%. So, I guess when the two classification labels are very much separated, maybe it is better not to use weight correction.  \nThat been said, a new set of data that may have a larger overlapping between the smoker two cases, may not be predicted as well as this one did.

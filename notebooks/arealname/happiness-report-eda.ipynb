Generosity seems to have little to do with the happiness of a nation, but the increased social support increases happiness exponentially. The perception of corruption within a nation only shows a small correlation with happiness, and only once the perception of corruption falls below about 0.6. \n\nAlthough happiness worldwide has remained fairly constant on average over the years 2015-2020, the difference between the happiest and least happy countries has grown. The biggest increases in happiness between 2015-2020 were seen in West Africa. The biggest drop in happiness over the same time period was in Venezuela. \n\nWe can divide the happiest quartile of countries into three clusters. The first cluster (consisting mostly of Northern Europe) is the happiest, richest, and perceives the lowest levels of corruption. The second (consisting mostly of Southern Europe and the USA) is almost as rich as the first, but perceives more corruption. The third cluster (consisting mostly of central and South American countries) is not as rich as the first two, but freer than the second. This third cluster is almost as happy as the second, despite being much poorer economially. \n\nWe can see that there are factors that contribute to happiness that are not found in this data set. This is clear from looking at two significant outliers: Singapore and Costa Rica. Singapore beats Costa Rica on every measure apart from freedom, where they are almost equal, but Costa Rica is much happier.

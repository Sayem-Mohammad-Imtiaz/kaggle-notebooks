When we go into meaning of these variables, explanation becomes easy, because it is obvious that number of credit lines and loans opened for a person will be at least equal to the number of loans/lines opened for a real estate property. It is further deducible from the scatter plot that when number of real estate loans are at lower side, number of credit loans become strongly decorrelated with the variable, which is to say that as a person gets more number of real estate loans, his/her tendency to open other kinds of loans decreases.\n\n**Plot 2**\n\nDebt ratio seems to have pecuilar relationship with the variable NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines. High number of real estate loans are taken by only people with no DebtRatio, and very high debt ratio seems to give an upper limit on the NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines.\n\n\n**Plot 3**\n\nThis plot has nearly the same behavior as Plot 2, but between different variables. Number of real estate loans and mortgages become significantly small as the monthly income becomes above a certain threshold. This makes sense because a person with high income wouldn't like to take loans for real estate for which the interest rates are often high. A similiar, but less correlated, relationship is seen between montly income, and total number of open credit loans.\n\n\n**But wait**, shouldn't the correlation coefficient be negative between variables of Plot 2 and 3, because it looks like higher debt ratio means lower NumberOfTimes90DaysLate in Plot 2, and similarly in Plot 3 the two variables look to be inversely correlated. Maybe we aren't getting a good picture at this scale, to make sense of the positive correlation, we plot at different x and y limits the two graphs in the following cell.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"1191da674a8ee32d7645d59a50c549d52687eb0e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig,axs=plt.subplots(1,2)\nfig.set_size_inches(11,4)\n\naxs[0].scatter(df_train[\"DebtRatio\"],df_train[\"NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines\"]);\naxs[0].set_xlim([100,40000])\naxs[0].set_ylim([-1,10])\n\naxs[1].scatter(df_train[\"MonthlyIncome\"],df_train[\"NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines\"]);\naxs[1].set_xlim([0,100000])\naxs[1].set_ylim([-1,50]);","execution_count":54,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"38cc3e02d68746389c57e8c077067bc9a96d8fb9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is now clear why the correlation coefficient for the two set of the variables was positive."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"765f2e1c-d169-494b-b327-a40374dfd949","_uuid":"486afd6c437ecf0e0096d079b2feb66958ae92f9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# More bivariate plots\nCorrelation was fastest way to look for the important pairs of variables for analysis.

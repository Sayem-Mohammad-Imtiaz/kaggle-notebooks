Both the government and companies keep changing their policies and strategies which affect stocks massively to either rise or fall anytime. The stock market is the most unpredictable area as these factors are unforeseen and subject to change in future. Thus it is difficult to make models that can accurately predict stock prices. Although it is possible to predict the trends, seasonality and other parameters based on the previous historical data. With the advent of deep learning state of art models, many systems are adapting it.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# NeuralProphet\n\nLast week Facebook released its new open source time series modelling Python library [NeuralProphet](http://ourownstory.github.io/neural_prophet/), a PyTorch based neural network forecasting tool. Neural Prophet is an up-gradation to Facebook's previously launched Prophet library. It is also based on AR-Net. The NeuralProphet framework addresses some key points - customization, scalability and extensibility. It is built on top of statistical and neural network models for time series modelling, used in any kind of forecasting and anomaly detection. NeuralProphet was created in collaboration with researchers at Monash and Stanford University. It's easy-to-use and enables researchers and engineers to build better time-based data models. \nNeuralProphet consists of components like trends, multiple seasonality modelled using Fourier terms, auto-regression implemented using Auto-Regressive Feed-Forward Neural Network, special events, future regressors and lagged regressors. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Stock Price Forecasting Using NeuralProphet\n### Installation: \nThe [GitHub](http://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet) repository can be cloned and used otherwise using pip.\n\npip install neuralprophet \n\nor \n\npip install neutralprophet[live] - This enables plot_live_live parameter in the train function to get live training and validation plots.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install neuralprophet[live]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom neuralprophet import NeuralProphet","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# reading dataset\nFor demonstration purposes, I've shown the forecasting on Coal India stocks.

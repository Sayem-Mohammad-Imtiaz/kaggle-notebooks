The post author asked for the same in python. Therefore, I am recreating this notebook in python. I have been coding in R throughout the majority of my career, nevertheless, I wanted to show that it can be recreated using python as well. The end values from my notebook in R are slightly different from what I have here due to other feature engineering conducted in the previous notebook that will not be present here. The concepts are all be the same.\n\nLet's get started and tackle the original question","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Original Question \n\nThere was a [task](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs/tasks?taskId=1586) that asked if there was a correlation between *salary* and *rating*. \n\n# The Short Answer - And a New Question\n\nYou can always calcualte the correlation coefficient for two variables; **the better question is: Is the correlation between *salary* and *rating* statistically significant?** If you are not sure what statistical significance is, I encourage you to read about it! Understanding the statistics behind models will make you a better data scientist. \n\n\n**Before we can answer the question, we must do some data preprocessing and think about the dataset. I would caution that the results of this analysis can only be specified to this dataset, which is not representative about jobs or salaries as a whole, and more importantly stress that CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION!!!**\n\n**So please interpret the results with caution.**\n\nNevertheless, lets do some data preprocessing:","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pyjanitor","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os\nfrom janitor import clean_names\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's read in the dataset and inspect the first few rows","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"analystJobsRaw = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/data-analyst-jobs/DataAnalyst.csv\").clean_names()\n\nanalystJobsRaw.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Engineering\n\nBecause the `salary_estimate` series only provides a range, we must feature engineer the average salary from the range.

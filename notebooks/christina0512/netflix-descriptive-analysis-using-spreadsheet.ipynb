While some parts of the world are shut down in uncertainty, it was said that Netflix gained 16 millions new sign-ups last year. Netflix reached 203.7 million subscribers in January 2021.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to analyze the data of movies and TV shows available on Netflix, based on the dataset I found on Kaggle - Netflix Movies and TV Shows by Shivam Bansal. Data wrangling and visualization are done with the help of **Microsoft Excel**.\n\nThis dataset provides information of TV shows and movies available on Netflix by 2021. The major focus of the analysis would be to generate facts and insights from the provided data.\n\n### Conclusion\nIn short: As expected from a streaming service that originally comes from America, movies and TV shows from United States are the majority in Netflix. Most appeared genres are 'Drama' and 'Comedies' despite the program's type (movie or TV show) and release year. There are more movies than TV shows available in Netflix, but Netflix is more focusing on TV shows in recent years.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Types of Content on Netflix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_image_in_actual_size('/kaggle/working/1.png')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.458726Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.459071Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.675224Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.459041Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.674201Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Pic: Movie dominates TV Show)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Countries with Most Content on Netflix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_image_in_actual_size('/kaggle/working/2.png')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.676926Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.677193Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.893106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.677168Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.891999Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Pic: United States comes out as first place unsurprisingly with over 3000 contents available on Netflix)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"display_image_in_actual_size('/kaggle/working/3.png')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.894316Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.894634Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-07T07:48:33.114124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-07T07:48:32.894607Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-07T07:48:33.113006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Pic: Dominating-countries with the content types comparison.)\n<br>\nAs shown above, United States and India have more movie.

As a final year Computer Science Student, I was instantly drawn to this dataset in hopes of not only understanding the general trend in the industry but also of reassuring myself that I was not a lost cause. Although this dataset is from an MBA college, I think it can still be used to extract valuable information about how one's academic choices can impact their placements.\n\nA quick glance at the dataset description on Kaggle tells us that it has the following columns:\n1. `sl_no` : Serial Number\n2. `gender` : Gender- Male='M',Female='F'\n3. `ssc_p` : Secondary Education percentage- 10th Grade\n4. `ssc_b` : Board of Education- Central/ Others\n5. `hsc_p` : Higher Secondary Education percentage- 12th Grade\n6. `hsc_b` : Board of Education- Central/ Others\n7. `hsc_s` : Specialization in Higher Secondary Education\n8. `degree_p` : Degree Percentage\n9. `degree_t` : Under Graduation(Degree type)- Field of degree education\n10. `workex` : Work Experience\n11. `etest_p` : Employability test percentage ( conducted by college)\n12. `specialisation` : Post Graduation(MBA)- Specialization\n13. `mba_p` : MBA percentage\n14. `status` : Status of placement- Placed/Not placed\n15. `salary` : Salary offered by corporate to candidates\n\nLet us quickly view the first few rows and extract some prelimindary information about the dataset."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"79e61909-6bce-4eb6-b1ff-85cf125e32b0","_cell_guid":"71a6d2c9-4b2e-42c7-bec1-83667d180f6e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading in the dataset and viewing first few rows \ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/factors-affecting-campus-placement/Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv\")\ndf.head()","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"abf47c98-6de3-4ea3-a1f3-cfa8e485696a","_cell_guid":"1215ecfb-6677-4597-a84a-2936922c4d32","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a4867baa-7e05-462d-896b-448c1d950da4","_cell_guid":"34ff4ee3-e4db-41c8-acf1-df833688d48c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Observations: \nIt seems that we have some big outliers in the salary.

I also drop the serial number as it could potentially lead to overfitting and adds no useful information to the dataset. \n\nThen I proceeded to One-hot encode for the categorical variables and dropped the original ones. Since most of the categorical columns contained only 2 or 3 unique values, the final dataset was not bloated too much and had 14 columns for the model to work with. \n\nHowever, when I tried to train the model, I ran into an error that prevented the Linear SVM from converging.

Though our analysis, we found that:\n1. The board of school education doesnt matter when it comes to placements or even salaries. \n2. Placed students seem to have performed better in their 10th and 12th exams than Non Placed Students \n3. Among the various specializations, students with a Sci&Tech UG degree and Mkt&Fin MBA specialization appear to have slightly higher salaries.\n4. The salaries for female students seems to be generally slightly lower than men.\n\nWe then proceeded to fit a linear SVM to predict whether or not a student would be placed and  achieved reasonably good results, with a test accuracy of **86.5**% after some data preprocessing.\n\n## What does this mean for you?  \n\nWe must first understand that the results and observations made in this notebook need to be taken with a grain of salt. After all, this dataset is not representative of the full spectrum of students that one comes across during a campus recruitment program. The dataset itself is quite limited in nature and as such, varies in the number of samples between different groups making it diffult to report with confidence the trends that we come across.\n\nInstead, I urge you to simply follow your heart and make your own choices. Regardless of what a dataset might indicate as being the *best stream* or *best specialization*, ultimately, the *best job* is the one that makes you happy! \n\nGood luck!"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

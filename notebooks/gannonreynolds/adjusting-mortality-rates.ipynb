I believe they are being understated in favor of simple calculations, and should be altered to better reflect the reality of this virus. We have been reporting the mortality rate as: \n\n$mortality = \\frac{deaths_{n}}{confirmed_{n}}$\n\nWhere $n$ is the current day, and $deaths_{n}$ and $confirmed_{n}$ are the cumulative deaths and confirmed cases respectively. \n\nHowever this ignores how many of the current cases will end up being deaths. I propose comparing the number of deaths to the total number of cases reported some $k$ days earlier. This value of $k$ should be the average time it takes for a confirmed case to become a death. The formula would thus look something like:\n\n$mortality = \\frac{deaths_{n-k}}{confirmed_{n}}$\n\nWhere $k$ is the average number of days it takes for a patient to die after being confirmed positive. This shift should eliminate the bias introduced by newly confirmed cases, and better reflect the probablity of survival.

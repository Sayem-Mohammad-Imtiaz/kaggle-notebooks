Usually, travel insurance will have coverage for travelers concerns, including flight delays, trip cancellation, or loggage loss. And, some of policies include medical emergency. It means that the insured's age might have an influence on whether the policy is claimed. \n## Problem:\nFor any insurance policy, we would like to know whether some features lead to the policy claimed. Some features like age, gender or commision value could have influence on that.

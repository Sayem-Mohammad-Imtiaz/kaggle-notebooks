Often people perceive whatever conveyed in the news to be true. There were circumstances where even the news channels acknowledged that their news is not true as they wrote. But some news have a significant impact not only to the people or government but also the economy. One news can shift the curves up and down depending on the emotions of people and political situation. It is important to identify the fake news from the real true news. The problem has been taken over and resolved with the help of Natural Language Processing tools which help us identify fake or true news based on the historical data. The news are now in safe hands !\n\n## Problem statement\nThe authenticity of Information has become a longstanding issue affecting businesses and society, both for printed and digital media. On social networks, the reach and effects of information spread occur at such a fast pace and so amplified that distorted, inaccurate or false information acquires a tremendous potential to cause real world impacts, within minutes, for millions of users. Recently, several public concerns about this problem and some approaches to mitigate the problem were expressed. . The sensationalism of not-so-accurate eye catching and intriguing headlines aimed at retaining the attention of audiences to sell information has persisted all throughout the history of all kinds of information broadcast. On social networking websites, the reach and effects of information spread are however significantly amplified and occur at such a fast pace, that distorted, inaccurate or false information acquires a tremendous potential to cause real impacts, within minutes, for millions of user\n\n## Objective\n1. Our sole objective is to classify the news  from the dataset to fake or true news. \n2. Extensive EDA of news\n3.

Considering the US elections 2020. There are chances to spread fake news and application of these technology will be heavily required.\n* Fake news are currently rooted during this pandemic situation to play politics and to scare people and force them to buy goods\n* Most of the news are from Reuters. We don't know whether this news media is politically influenced. So we should always consider the source of news to find if the news is fake or true.\n\nYou can check [Josué Nascimento's](https://www.kaggle.com/josutk/only-one-word-99-2) work where he has explained why this dataset is more biased\n\nYou can also check out my other notebooks [here](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

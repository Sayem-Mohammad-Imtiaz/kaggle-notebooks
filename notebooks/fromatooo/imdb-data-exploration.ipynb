The number of Votes that contribute to the rating seem to grow with the Revenue the year on the other hand does not influence the number of Votes. The negative correlation seems to be due to some very popular, older movies (maybe we should find out which of the movies are the super popular ones to plan the next movie night!).\n\nInterestingly enough, a high number of votes in many cases is also accompanied by a high Rating. Apparently people like to share their opinon on the movies they like and when they care enough to vote they also care about the movie. We saw this already in the Rating histogram in the beginning. \n\n**Lastly: The Relation between Revenue, Rating and Metascore.**\n\nEither high grossing movies are the favorites of the IMDB community or the favorites of the IMDB commuinty get a lot of attention by the looks of this little plot. The critics giving out the Metascore do not seem to be as closely related to the revenue. Maybe no one is following their recommendations.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nNext Would like to dig deeper into the information hidden in the long strings of f.Genre and f.Actors. Unfortunately in the current state they are hard to use due to most of the values being unique. In the next step i would like to reshape the data to gain some information about the relations between Genres, Actors and the numeric values. I probably will reduce the number of Genres in some way, or find a new mapping to reduce the number of unique genres and form bigger clusters. I might also be interested in looking into the metrics for individual Actors, that had a lot of appearances. \n\n### Thanks for reading. \n\nIf anyone did, i would be more than happy about your feedback and some pointers on where i could improve on this :)."}],"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"},"language_info":{"nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.1","name":"python","file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}}}}

The curve is clearly falttening. And the proportion of fatalities is lower in Germany than in many other countries.\nI see three reasons why Germany is coming throuhg this crisis relatively well. \n\nFirst, the German health-care system was in good shape going into the crisis; everyone has had full access to medical care.\n\nSecond, Germany was not the first country to be hit by the virus, and thus had time to prepare. The government took the COVID-19 threat seriously from the beginning.\n\nThird, Germany is home to many laboratories that can test for the test, and to many distinguished researchers in the field.\n\nReferences:  \n1.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Germany  \n2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9eSeRgEIH4","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

We realize that we can use this data to make sure we get a good deal on a new car. In particular, we can figure out exactly how much one should pay for a specific type of car. \nNow Comes the Linear Regression to our rescue!**\n\n**Linear Regression is a method for discovering the relationship between two variables in the dataset, such as price of the car and the year it was made. Data Scientists rely on this method for solving a wide range of problems, especially when it comes to prediction.**\n\n1. I have used a simplified Linear Regression model with sufficient data analysis and feature engineering to reach the desired r2 score of [.831].\n2. Do keep monitoring this kernel for future versions,improvements and to check the implementation of some newer and advanced regression models !\n3. Do UpVote the Notebook if you find it helpful !\n\n## About the dataset\n**This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com\nThis data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.\nThe columns in the given dataset is as follows:**\n* Car_Name\n* Year\n* Selling_Price\n* Present_Price\n* Kms_Driven\n* Fuel_Type\n* Seller_Type\n* Transmission\n* Owner"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imports\n\n\n1. Let's get our environment ready with the libraries we'll need and then import the relevant ones beforehand!\n2. Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science.

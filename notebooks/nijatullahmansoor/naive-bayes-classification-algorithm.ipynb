It is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. `In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.`  For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter. Even if these features depend on each other or upon the existence of the other features, all of these properties independently contribute to the probability that this fruit is an apple and that is why it is known as ‘Naive’.  \n`Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.`\n\n### Principle of Naive Bayes Classifier:\n\nA Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task. It works on Bayes theorem of probability to predict the class of unknown data sets. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.\n\n### Bayes Theorem:\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/638/1*tjcmj9cDQ-rHXAtxCu5bRQ.png\">\n\n\nUsing Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.\n\n\nTo understand this we need to know first Conditional probability. please refer to ther <a href=\"http://www.cs.uni.edu/~campbell/stat/prob4.html\">Conditional probability and the product rule</a>\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's import the required library.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for data visualization purposes\nimport seaborn as sns # for statistical data visualization\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T17:04:57.943993Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T17:04:57.944808Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T17:04:57.95234Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T17:04:57.94477Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T17:04:57.951343Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data\nWe will use the Pima indian diabetes dataset.

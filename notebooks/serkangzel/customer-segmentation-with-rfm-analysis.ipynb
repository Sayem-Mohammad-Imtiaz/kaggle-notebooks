The group median was 375.0, so there was not much deviation from the mean. Therefore, it can be said that this number is consistent throughout the group. On average, 3.89 units of shopping were made and 1379.64 units of payments were made. The time interval that has passed since the last purchase of this group is very high, so customers may be lost. The reasons that may cause these people not to shop for so long should be focused on. There may be a case of customer dissatisfaction. The shopping experience of the customer can be examined by sending a survey via mail. If there is no dissatisfaction, then the person is reminded. Options such as discount codes may be offered to encourage re-shopping.\n\n__Need Attention__\n\n\nPeople in this group last shopping, on average, 112 days ago. The group median is 105, so there is not much deviation from the mean. Hence, this number is consistent across the group. On average, 3.14 units of shopping were made and 1276.34 units of payment were made. This group is less risky than the At-Risk group. The last shopping date is relatively close. Special offers can be made from products whose consumption is faster than among the products that those customers shop. By doing this, the average visit time of customers can be shortened.\n\n__Potential Loyalists__\n\nThose in this group last shopping an average of 24 days ago. The group median is 22, so there is not much deviation from the mean. Hence, this number is consistent across the group. On average, 2.58 units were purchased and 1158.27 units were paid. People in this group can be included in the Loyal Customer group if supported. Therefore, they can be monitored closely and customer satisfaction can be increased with one-to-one phone calls. Apart from this, options such as free shipping can be offered to increase the average paid wages.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

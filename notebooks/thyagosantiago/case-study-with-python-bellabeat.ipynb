Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and\nconsistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n\n##The scenario and main questions##\n\nSršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\nWe need to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. We must select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in our presentation. These questions will guide the analysis:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n##Key Stakeholders:##\n\n**Urska Srsen** - Bellabeat cofounder and CCO\n\n**Sando Mur** - Bellabeat cofounder\n\n**Bellabeat marketing analytics team**\n\n##Products##\n\n**1.

We should explore further, but part of those users may not wear their devices daily due to the lack of resistance for different activities, like swimming for example \n- Considering that the users who are most active normally rely on manual reporting, Bellabeat should invest on improving their accuracy, increasing the adoption of automatic reports, wich would give more practicality for customers\n- Those users don't have a product like Spring, wich can help tracking water intake. Bellabeat should explore this in order to cross sell Spring for users who own other devices\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy? ###\n\n- Knowing that users are mostly active between 6pm and 9pm, Bellabeat could explore the activities that are mostly executed by women in that timeframe and target their pratictioners \n- Knowing that with more steps users tend to burn more calories and mantain a better heart rate, Bellabeat should explore this to communicate the benefits of walking enough and tracking activity to maintain your overall health.

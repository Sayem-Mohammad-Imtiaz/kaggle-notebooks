Then, my proposal is the next one:\n\n1.- To check if these loss data is random along the whole dataset or not.\n\n2.- If it is random or if it is a set or family (in example one kind of train ha most of null values), due to the size of the dataset, I will remove these records, so that, we have enough information (as fitst estimation) to perform the pridciton. Why I am also taking this decission? Because it would not be very accurate to predict over predictions, the result could be not satisfactory\n\n3.- If it is not random and it is centered over a range or over a kind of data, I will remove these categories (even these with price data), why? because under my point of view it would be more efficient to focus over the rest of the categories to predict.\n\nLet's work:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First of all, lets see which are most popular origins, destionations and trains that are taken by people:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef routes(df, group):\n    for i in group:\n        seti = np.unique(df[i])\n        Q_i = list()\n        for orig in seti:\n            aux = len(df.index[data[i]==orig])\n            Q_i.append(aux)\n        if len(seti) >5:\n            plt.barh(seti, Q_i)\n            plt.show()\n        else:\n            plt.bar(seti, Q_i)\n            plt.show()\n        \nroutes(data, [\"origin\", \"destination\", \"train_type\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that we know which are the most famous places (Madrid, Barcelona & Sevilla) in Spain (at least to take trains), lets see what is happening with prices.

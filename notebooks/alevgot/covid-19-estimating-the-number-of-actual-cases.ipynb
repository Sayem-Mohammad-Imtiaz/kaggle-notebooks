Introduction \n\nWe are estimating the number of infected people per day in the region. The median time from first symptom to death was estimated as 19-20 days from statistics [1, 2]. The median time from first symptom to confirmation can be estimated as a sum of incubation period and testing period [3]. We use the adjustable coefficient d_rate to match the two estimates from confirmed case and death statistics. D_rate varies depending on the country and stage of the epidemic, the height of the epidemic peak, the medical resources and the age distribution of the patients [4]. Also we assume three simplifications \n1. Assumption. The mortality rate in a given region is the same, does not change over time.\n2. Assumption. Proportion of risk groups in population in a given region is the same, does not change over time.\n3. Assumption. Herd immunity does not change over time.\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nCOVID-19 can proceed without symptoms (asympomatic) or in a mild form. Asympomatic cases were diagnozied for 17% of Diamond Princess passengers and 33% of Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan [5, 6].  \n\n\nLiterature\n1. Wang D. et al.

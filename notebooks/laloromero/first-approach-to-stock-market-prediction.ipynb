ARIMA Models ##\n\nARIMA models can be separated as nonseasonal and seasonal. The noneseasonals are classified as $ARIMA(p,d,q)$ model, where\n* $p$ is the number of autoregressive terms,\n* $d$ is the number of noneseasonal differences needed for stationarity\n* $q$ is the number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.\n\nIn a general way, the forecast equation can be written as $\\hat{y}_t=\\mu+{\\phi_1}{y_t}_{-1}+\\cdots+{\\phi_t}{y_t}_{-p}{-\\theta_1}{e_t}_{-1}-\\cdots-{\\theta}_q{e_t}_{-q}$. The moving average parameters are represented as $\\theta$, $\\phi$ expresses coeficients for difference parameters and $\\mu$ represents a constant value.\n\nSelecting the correct number of AR and MA terms for ARIMA model can be performed in two different ways. One is by trying all kind of combinations using a computer software until it finds which fit correctly the time serie, or by looking at the ACF and PACF to get an aproximation. Note that exists more sophisticated alternatives.\n\nThen, AR and MA terms are going to be selected based on the previous ACF and PACF plots. It's possible to determine the AR terms if lag *k* is more significant than the higher orders lags, that is PACF cuts off at lag *k*, thus would be *k* AR components. The same occurs for MA terms and ACF, if lag *k* is more significant than the higher orders lags, then would be *k* components for MA.\n\nBy performing lots of test, the best results given by ARIMA model was with $p = 1$, $d = 0$ and $q = 0$."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"de236dfda93e06d86e02c5a00bdbccf46e504600"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX\n\n# Raw time serie\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True) \ngs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 1, figure=fig)\nax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, :])\nax.plot(ts_decompose)\nax.set_xlabel('time [months]')\nax.set_ylabel('data')\nax.set_title('Logged data')\n\nmodel = ARIMA(ts_decompose, order=(1, 0, 0))\nres = model.fit(disp=-2)\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1, :])\nax2.plot(res.fittedvalues)\nax2.set_xlabel('time [months]')\nax2.set_ylabel('data')\nax2.set_title('ARIMA model')\n\nprint('ARIMA RMSE: %.6f'% np.sqrt(sum((res.fittedvalues-ts_decompose)**2)/len(ts)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2a1d93b5761e1889acb7b1d40403ae4dbd525655"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"5-2\"></a> <br>\n## 5.2.

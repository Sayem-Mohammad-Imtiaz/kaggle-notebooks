It is used on a daily by professionals and hobysts alike, mainly as a tool (a forum, if you will) for discussing programming problems. \n\nEver since 2015, Stackoverflow has hosted a developer survey to learn more about its user-base, with questions ranging from programming related questions, salary and ethics. The new installment of the survey reached about 100.000 people, almost 4 times as much as the first one held 3 years ago.\n\nThere's a wide range of information available, and no obligation to answer all questions. The main focus of this study is to find out if there's a direct correlation between how much someone earns and several programming and career related topics. In order to have a meaningful analysis, questions that have little relation with salary, or that have too many missing values, will be removed.\n\nSince people from all over the world respond to this survey and it's impossible to have a good global salary analysis in a single model (without build extremely complex ensembles) we will limit our analysis to USA residents."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4b37886c746864c4c11f3d7788f65f555782636c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Index"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6742f9ebbe6207e879999511811a9ba25bcd39f8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This kernel is organized in the following way:\n\n1.

The only special one is salary, which should be converted into salary ranges to better categorize people. We know that the lower 10% is at 49k, the top is at 102k and the medium is 69k dollars. That is, the majority should be somewhere in between 49k and 102k, which seems about right for developer salaries in most parts of USA, except by cities with high cost of living. \n\nHowever, we can see on our distribution above that most developers seems to be on the 50k to 150k range! With that in mind, we can't blindly follow the average USA salary statistics, it seems more appropriate to use the following salary brackets:\n 1. 15k to 60k\n 2. 60k to 120k\n 3. 120k to 300k\n"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.205714Z","start_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.140778Z"},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"85360a64a7ecc4e25b72fa6df384411dc3e06105"},"cell_type":"code","source":"first_bracket = \"From 15k to 60k\"\nsecond_bracket =  \"From 60k to 110k\"\nthird_bracket = \"From 110k to 300k\"\n\nfeatures['SalaryRange'] = pd.cut(features['ConvertedSalary'], bins=[15000, 60000, 110000, 300000], labels=[first_bracket, second_bracket, third_bracket])\nfeatures = features[features.columns.difference(['ConvertedSalary'])];","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"10845d1f41a49dcd61ca700ab9b4f193960cfb07"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the distribution:"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.462463Z","start_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.20671Z"},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"b83acfac3e53cfbfd168fea148fe48ea7221763c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.xticks(rotation='45')\nsns.countplot(features['SalaryRange'], order=[first_bracket, second_bracket, third_bracket])\nplt.title('Salary distribution', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a19f2a9aab34370d5baf6f5c33a1ed62beacb4b1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The distribution indicates that people who use StackOverflow and participate on its events (such as this survey) are, on average, much better paid."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.490436Z","start_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.463447Z"},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"84890a2175b3e8db76bccaf4c0cfe65852ed14ec"},"cell_type":"code","source":"features = features.dropna();\nprint(\"Number of entries: \" + str(len(features.index)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a02a2ee45a013b8e65647da07a20916690ca895c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the distribution: "},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.504405Z","start_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.491433Z"},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"66794b7ec73eac454d4716c8b7e6efa22cdc1ca5"},"cell_type":"code","source":"features['SalaryRange'].describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"18f668d91302d592f670210a5318aa12f7ad9edb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.3 Career satisfaction"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52a2c9072cdaae3535c4c73f9365cbc8d94d2b08"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets take a look at the career satisfaction distribution:"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.763142Z","start_time":"2018-08-17T15:22:08.506406Z"},"trusted":false,"_uuid":"9f66efa78622974f1b51afca56d6c86095990cfa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 7))\nplt.xticks(rotation='45')\nsns.countplot(features['CareerSatisfaction'], order=['Extremely dissatisfied', 'Slightly dissatisfied', 'Moderately dissatisfied', 'Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied', 'Slightly satisfied', 'Moderately satisfied', 'Extremely satisfied'])\nplt.xlabel('Career satisfaction', fontsize=15)\nplt.title('How people feel about their career', fontsize=15)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6cf358b67501f67f1aaf29c59102a3d7cfc1a8f8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Almost half the respondents are moderately satisfied with their careers.

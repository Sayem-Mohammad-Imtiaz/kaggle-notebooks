The first explanation is there is one population with diabetes, and thus higher levels of glucose than those without diabetes. Another explanation is that people have different glucose levels depending on the time of day and how recently they have eaten, so those measured right before a meal would have lower glucose levels, and those measured after a meal have higher levels.

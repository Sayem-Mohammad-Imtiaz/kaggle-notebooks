It is expected that an increase in vaccination will lead to a drop in daily new cases.\nHowever, from the analysis, we can see that this is not the case for Chile.\n\n\nThe global ranking of Chile for the highest total number of cases is 23rd out of 220 countries.\nOn the other hand, the global ranking for the highest total vaccinations per number of people is 9th out of 211 countries.\n\n\nI asked my part-time co-worker from Chile about his country's situation. \nAccording to him, a lot of Chilean people did not treat the pandemic seriously. They went to clandestine parties even when it's prohibited. These parties became sources of outbreak.\nJust as the restrictions were loosened by the government, people started to travel across provinces and flocking to shopping malls. Traffic jams resumed. The malls were packed and people were not social distancing.  \n\nChile serves as a warning for other countries to not rush on easing restrictions even when most of the population is vaccinated. \n\n\n**Source:**\n\n\n> My friend, Juan Pablo Parra\n\n\n> Taylor, L..

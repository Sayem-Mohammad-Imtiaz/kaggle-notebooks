For the reference section, [**click here**](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/summary-functions-and-maps-reference).\n\nIn the last section we learned how to select relevant data out of our `pandas` `DataFrame` and `Series` objects. Plucking the right data out of our data representation is critical to getting work done, as we demonstrated in the visualization exercises attached to the workbook.\n\nHowever, the data does not always come out of memory in the format we want it in right out of the bat. Sometimes we have to do some more work ourselves to reformat it for the task at hand.\n\nThe remainder of this tutorial will cover different operations we can apply to our data to get the input \"just right\". We'll start off in this section by looking at the most commonly looked built-in reshaping operations. Along the way we'll cover data `dtypes`, a concept essential to working with `pandas` effectively.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 5)\nreviews = pd.read_csv(\"../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv\", index_col=0)\n\nfrom learntools.core import binder; binder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.pandas.summary_functions_and_maps import *\nprint(\"Setup complete.\")\n\nreviews.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exercises","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.\n\nWhat is the median of the `points` column in the `reviews` DataFrame?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# median_points = reviews['points'].median()\nmedian_points = reviews.points.median()\n\nq1.check()\nmedian_points","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# q1.hint()\n#q1.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. \nWhat countries are represented in the dataset?

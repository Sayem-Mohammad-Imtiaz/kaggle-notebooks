Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.\n\n\nThis case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

Highest percentage of Refusal of loans also is in the same category. Based on proportionally high defaulters, more care should be taken while giving loans for repairs, other purposes, buying a used car, buying a house or an annex.\n- Refusal of loans is highest for customers earning a high income.

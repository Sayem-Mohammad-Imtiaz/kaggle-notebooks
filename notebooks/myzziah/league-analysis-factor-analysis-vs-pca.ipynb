The fundamental mathematical difference between the two methods is this (Bishop, 2014):\n\n   <b>PCA: C ≈ WW<sup>⊤</sup></b>\n\n   <b>FA: C ≈ WW<sup>⊤</sup> + Ψ</b>\n\n    Where C represents the covariance matrix of our dataset, W being a matrix of our data after deciding how many components to keep (like how we retained <i>'k'</i> factors in    FA) and Ψ the diagonal matrix. This diagonal matrix is the representation of uniqueness (total variance - communalities).  \n\n2. In PCA, because of the absence of Ψ, we're not looking to determine a causal statement about the relationships. In FA, we're seek latent causes that will eventually be interpreted as the reason for our observed, measured variables. This is why in FA, we try to interpret and categorize the Factors. In PCA, not so much. We're simply finding a linear combination of our variables that create the 'Component', so there's no guarantee the Components are interpretable.\n\n3. In FA, there are a lot of possible algorithms to choose from (depending on different assumptions). This can result in some algorithms resulting in a dead end (Heywood Case) and is a more of an art form than PCA. In PCA, just perform eigen decomposition and you're done.\n\nIt is worth noting that as the dimensionality (n) of our dataset increases, the differences between PCA and FA decreases. However for a small <i>'n'</i>, the difference is significant (Carine, 2014).\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first necessary step in PCA is to scale our data.

There are clear signs of overemphasis on some contributions and underemphasis in others. The following attempts to explain why:\r\n\r\nPCA is trying to achieve two things at the same time: Minimising the mean-squared error (MSE) of data points while also maximising the spread of variance. In other words - our resultant components should not only be an accurate interpretation/reconstruction of our variables (minimising MSE) but also construct new characteristics that strongly differ across variables (maximise variance). With that being said, let's pose two hypotheticals: What if our original dataset's variables had low colinearity? What if our original dataset's variables had high colinearity? (which our dataset has both).\r\n\r\nIf a dataset's features had little colinearity, PCA would be of almost no use to reduce dimensionality. If our dataset had 100 very unique and uncorrelated variables, then it would take 100 Principal Components to explain those 100 very unique and uncorrelated variables (Phan, 2016 pp. 6). This is why it's 'standard' practice to remove variables with low correlations, although this practice may be misleading and other approaches such as finding small subsets of original variables that approximate the various PCs in some optimal way (Silva, 2000). If a dataset's features had high colinearity, then the effect of adding more and more nearly correlated variables increases the contribution of the common underlying factor in PCA, causing PCA to overemphasise the contribution (Type2, 2013).\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing how other individuals used PCA in this particular dataset in Kaggle, it seems like very little is addressed on these matters. Therefore, it may be preferable to search for small subsets of the original variables that approximate the relevant PCs in some optimal way (Silva, 2000). There are proposed algorithms and new criteria of what subsets of original variables will approximate the relevant PCs found in both Silva's <i>Discarding Variables in Principal Component Analysis: Algorithms for All-Subsets Comparisons</i> and Cadima & Jolliffe's <i>Variable selection and the interpretation of principal subspaces</i>.\r\n\r\nHowever due to the computational intensity of either working out the criteria of each possible subset (2<sup>N</sup>-1 of non-empty subset possibilities), the ambiguity of choosing the specific subsets or the complexity of working out algorithms such as Yanai's GCD/McGabe's 4 Criterion from above, we won't touch this realm of PCA (at least in this notebook, maybe another one in the future?). Instead, we're going to narrow in to a much simpler method suggested by one of the same authors Jolliffe: the B2/B4 method (Joliffe, 2002, p. 138).\r\n\r\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<u><b>PCA Selection methods</b></u>\r\n\r\nThe B2 procedure begins by doing PCA over our <i> n &#215; p</i> data matrix.

The <i>p - q</i> variables are then removed (Siswadi, Muslim & Bekhtiar, 2012). This can be done as a whole <i>p - q</i> block or one by one and performing multiple PCAs. Jolliffe explores the distinctive ways of deleting the variables and determines deleting en bloc consistently failed to select an appropriate subset for some simple correlation structures (Joliffe, 2002, p. 138).\r\n\r\nThe B4 procedure is associating one variable with each of the first <i>m</i> PCs, namely the variable not already chosen with the highest loading.

However when comparing the two, only the first two variances/eigenvalues were greater than the first two values, suggesting we only retain two variables. While this may be of discussion, we ignored the results in this notebook as two PCs could only explain a maximum of around 33%. Furthermore, Bartkowiak with an empirical comparison shows us that most of the rules lead to similar decisions on how many components/variables to keep - except the broken stick rule (Jolliffe, 2002 p. 132).\r\n\r\nBecause FA considers communality (while PCA doesn't), it makes it easier to distinguish variables which we should inherently remove after one iteration. We can see that using logistic regression after the B4 method results in some variables with higher p-values (blueWardsDestroyed, blueWardsPlaced, redTotalJungleMinionsKilled) - variables FA has already analyzed and has deemed unfit to use. While there are ways around this in PCA by analyzing multiple criteria and subsets, it seems like FA has been overall more effective in our notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<u><b>Conclusion:</b></u>\r\n\r\nGold accumulation through early kills/solid last-hitting as well as securing early dragon kills maximises your chances in winning your League of Legends games.\r\n\r\nThe first 10 minutes of almost 10000 diamond-ranked games were analyzed through Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis.

it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine\n\n**total sulfur dioxide** - amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine\n\n**density** - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content\n\n**pH** - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale\n\n**sulphates** - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant\n\n**alcohol** - the percent alcohol content of the wine\n\n## Some initial thoughts:\n\n1) Some of the columns are pretty chemical in nature and would probably require some domain knowledge to understand them fully\n\n2) Some columns provide us info with how to better explore our data\n\n    a) For example, whenever residual sugar is >45 grams / liter, they are considered more sweet chlorides.

In addition, this builds trees in a serial manner with each tree trying to correct mistakes of the previous one.  I think this also best micmics the real-life wine tasting profession.

A wine rating is therefore a subjective quality score, typically of a numerical nature, given to a specific bottle of wine. In most cases, wine ratings are set by a single wine critic, but in some cases a rating is derived by input from several critics tasting the same wine at the same time.*\n\nAnd each wine critic probably learns from his or her previous wine tasting.\n\n**SVM**.

Lets take a calculator, we input the numbers and it runs the calculations and gives the output because the calaculator already has the model(equation) to give output. Whereas in regression, we have input and output data, we need to find the best fitting model. Thus the word 'regress' best fits.\n- Simple regression has only two variables (one input and one output)\n- Multiple regression has more than two variables (more than one input and one output variable)<br>\n\n\n***A linear relation between Score vs GDP per capita can be clearly seen in the above graph.

We will use the Breast Cancer dataset to try to predict if a tumor is benign or malignant. This dataset was obtained on <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data\">kaggle</a>. The link contains the complete description but all you need to know to understand this analysis will be defined here. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n    I put a few comments on throughout the analysis to either clarify some points or give my opinion on a subject. Those are presented in blockquotes colored in dark blue. <br>\n<blockquote>\n    <font color=\"darkblue\">This is a comment!</font>\n</blockquote>\nI hope you enjoy this work and can get some useful insight or piece of code from it.</p>\n\n**Keywords**:<br>\nPython, Machine Learning, Model Stacking, Feature Engineering, Health\n\n### Contents\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TZCFAfs.png)\n\n\n### TLDR Version\n\nThis dataset contains information on 569 breast tumors and the mean, standard error and worst measures for 10 different properties. I start with an EDA analysing each properties' distribution, followed by the pair interactions and then the correlations with our target: the tumor diagnosis.\n\nAfter the EDA I set up 10 out-of-the-box models for a first evaluation and use cross-validation to measure them. I use Recall instead of Accuracy or F1-Score since I want to detect all malignant tumors. After the first results I analyse features importances, do a single round of feature selection and evaluate the models again. By the end of the chapter I analyse model errors and from the 10 first models I choose 5 for model tuning: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and KNN.\n\nI then proceed to tune the five models using GridSearchCV and prepare the data for model stacking by predicting probabilities for both train and test sets. Using Logistic Regression as a second-level model, I tune its parameters and finish the construction phase.\n\nFinally, I test all first level models and the stacked Logistic Regression on our untouched test-set. For the first level models, using regular 0.5 threshold Logistic Regression performed best with 95,8% Recall. By lowering the threshold SVC and Logistic Regression tied with over 98% recall with SVC having a higher Accuracy. By using the model-stacking technique, Logistic Regression was able to obtain 100% Recall on the test set. On the last chapter I summarize the findings and conclusions.\n\nOn Annex - A I repeat a few Machine Learning steps using SMOTE to generate new data points making the data balanced. \n\nOn Annex - B I use three different dimensionality reduction techniques to see if I can reduce the dataset and still get a good test score."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1 - The Dataset\n---\n## 1.1 - Introducing the Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### General Information\n- Original format: csv\n- Dataset shape: 569 x 33 (rows x columns)\n- Granularity: Each row derives from an unique sample of breast mass\n- There are no null values in this data.\n- The values are in different scales\n\n### Features in the dataset\nFor each sample ten properties were measured:\n\n<ol>\n    <li><b>Radius</b> - Mean distances from center to points on the perimeter</li>\n    <li><b>Texture</b> - Standard deviation of gray scale values</li>\n    <li><b>Perimeter</b></li>\n    <li><b>Area</b></li>\n    <li><b>Smoothness</b> - Local variation in radius lengths</li>\n    <li><b>Compactness</b> - Perimeter^2/Area - 1</li>\n    <li><b>Concavity</b> - Severity of concave portions of the contour</li>\n    <li><b>Concave points</b> - Number of concave portions of the contour</li>\n    <li><b>Simmetry</b></li>\n    <li><b>Fractal Dimension</b> - Coastline approximation - 1 </li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n    <font color='darkblue'>\n        <b>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension\">wikipedia</a>:</b>\n        <br><i>[...] a <b>fractal dimension</b> is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail in a pattern (strictly speaking, a fractal pattern) changes with the scale at which it is measured.</i>\n    </font>\n    </blockquote>\n    \nAnd for each of these properties we have three calculated values:\n- **Mean**\n- **Standard Error**\n- **Worst** (Average of the 3 largest values)\n\nAll the measures are float types.\n\n### Target\nOur target is the categorical column *diagnosis* with either B (benign) or M (malignant).<br>\nThere are 357 benign classes and 212 malignant classes - roughly **37% malignant tumors**."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr/>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2 -  Importing Libraries"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We need only the basic tools for an EDA for now."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nsns.set(style='whitegrid', rc={'axes.grid': False})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dataset = pd.read_csv('../input/data.csv')\ndataset.sample(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Our last column is just an error in the data reading.

We've evaluated them on Recall and Accuracy by using cross-validation. Based on the first results we did a single round of feature selection by analysing the feature importances and then we analysed the models' errors to help us decide on which ones to keep and which ones to drop. By the end of Chapter Three we had five remaining models: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and KNN.\n\n**Chapter Four** was all about tuning the models selected on the previous chapter to optimize the hyperparameters.\n\n**Chapter Five** sets up the data for a model stacking by predicting the probabilities for each tuned model for the training and test sets and then tunes the Second-Level model - a Logistic Regression - using the new training data.\n\nFinally, **Chapter Six** evaluates all models on the untouched test-set. For the first-level models, SVC and Logistic Regression performed best (which was already hinted on chapter three without any tuning). Lowering the threshold got a 98,5% Recall for them. With the second-level Logistic Regression we were able to reach 100% Recall!   \n\nPlease leave your thoughts or questions in the comments.

Ideally, we would need our data with classes split evenly. There are different ways to approach this problem and I suggest you reading this <a href='https://medium.com/james-blogs/handling-imbalanced-data-in-classification-problems-7de598c1059f'>blog post</a> by Hoang Minh for an introduction to the problem and other links for further reading.\n\nThe most intuitive way to deal with this is to drop some of the data from the class with most ocurrences until we have a 50-50 balance. However, we have a pretty small dataset already so that is not a good option here. If we can't lower the number of benigns, we need to increase the number of malignants and gathering more real data is not feasible - so we create synthetic data. \n\n**SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) is one of the methods to do that. Roughly SMOTE looks for the location of the minority class in our feature space and creates synthetic data *between* the real data. **Put in simple words**: Say we have a 1D (only one feature) data. SMOTE finds out that there are two malignant tumors with values of 10 and 12 (e.g. radius) so it creates another malignant data point between those two, with a value of 11.\n\nEnough explaining.

Instead, the content-based method only has to analyze the items and a single user’s profile for the recommendation, which makes the process less cumbersome. Content-based filtering would thus produce more reliable results with fewer users in the system.\n* Transparency: Collaborative filtering gives recommendations based on other unknown users who have the same taste as a given user, but with content-based filtering items are recommended on a feature-level basis.\n* No cold start: As opposed to collaborative filtering, new items can be suggested before being rated by a substantial number of users.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Disadvantages of Content Based Filtering\n* Limited content analysis: If the content doesn’t contain enough information to discriminate the items precisely, the recommendation itself risks being imprecise.\n* Over-specialization: Content-based filtering provides a limited degree of novelty, since it has to match up the features of a user’s profile with available items. In the case of item-based filtering, only item profiles are created and users are suggested items similar to what they rate or search for, instead of their past history. A perfect content-based filtering system may suggest nothing unexpected or surprising.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"modeled after: https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/recommender-systems-with-python-part-i-content-based-filtering-5df4940bd831","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

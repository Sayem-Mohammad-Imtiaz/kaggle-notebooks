With parametric method which assume distribution, there is a strong limitation that the data you want to analyze must be suitable for the assumed distribution. For example, we can't analyze multimodal distribution with single gauss distribution. We have to use dimore complex models like Gaussian mixture model. By nonparametric method, we can analyze such data with fewer assumptions.\n\nNote, I refer following discussion from reference [2] (check notebook's bottom).\n\n----------------\n\nFirst, we consider area R. R is very small and it's probability *P* is:\n\n$$\n   P = \\int_R p(x)dx\n$$\n\nIf there are N samples, the probability which K sample of them are in R is following:\n\n$$\n   Bin(K | N,P) = \\frac{N!}{K!(N-K)!} P^K (1-P)^{N-K}\n$$\n\nSince kth is either in or out of the region R, it's probabirity follows binomial distribution.\n\nWith binomial distribution, avarage and variance are:\n\n$$\n   E[K/N] = P\n$$\n\n$$\n   var[K/N] = P(1-P)/N\n$$\n\nIf we assume N is so big. Then var[K/N] approachs zero. So we can guessã€€E[K/N] = P.\n\nNow, we can write K in this small R,\n\n$$\n  K = NP\n$$\n\nIf we assume R is so small such that p(x) is same all over the R,\n\n$$\n  P = p(x) V\n$$\n\nV is the volume of R.\n\nFrom last two equation, we get\n\n$$\n  p(x) = \\frac{K}{NV}\n$$\n\n---------------------------\n\nNow, we get expressionã€€of p(x) by K, N and V. In KNN, we constrain K and change V. In other words, we give K when we create model instance and search for the nearest K points. And we consider as up to the Kth most distant point is included in this region R.\n\n---------------------------\n\nFor classification, we want to know p(C_k|x). By Bayes' theorem,\n\n$$\n  p(C_k|x) = \\frac{p(x|C_k)p(C_k)}{p(x)}\n$$\n\nSince above discussion, we can guess probability that given vector is kth class,\n\n$$\n  p(x|C_k) = \\frac{K_k}{N_kV}\n$$\n\nand p(C_k) is simply,\n\n$$\n  p(C_k) = \\frac{N_k}{N}\n$$\n\nSo finally we get,\n\n$$\n  p(C_k|x) = \\frac{N_k}{N}\n$$\n\n---------------------------\n\nOkay, we get very simple p(C_k|x) representation. Using this, we can get probability that given vector is kth class!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### implementation\n\nI will implement the model according to the theory described above.

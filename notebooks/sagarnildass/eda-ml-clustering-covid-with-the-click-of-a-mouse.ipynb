The sheer ability to extract meaningful information out of nothing is a wonder by itself. But being a data scientist comes with its own kinks. One of the major challenges of data science is code writing. One often writes hundreds of lines of codes to achive the feat of extracting valuable information from data. But then also, this is not scalable. As the data changes, the code changes. As a result, we have to write hundreds of lines of codes again even though the processes/pipelines remain the same. But what if we could make a one stop platform for doing our regular data science work at the click of a mouse - Starting from data processing, EDA all the way to modelling?\n\nTo answer this ever growing problem, we are developing a **FREE** one stop community platform for Data Scientists named **\"CyberDeck\"**. Every similar platform we have seen costs a lot of money. But not this. This is not out for release yet. But if we get a positive feedback from this gold mine of a community, we will make that a reality soon tentatively by the end of this year!\n\nTo demonstrate the capability of CyberDeck, we are choosing the COVID India dataset. We will do a side by side comparison of coding vs using CyberDeck for a variety of processes. We will perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis and then do machine learning to predict the number of total cases. After that, we will demonstrate our Explainable AI section to understand what features impact the chances of COVID the most and do a \"WHAT-IF\" analysis to see some interesting turn of events that would have happened if some feature values were changed.\n\nIn our previous kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/sagarnildass/convert-your-data-science-hours-to-minutes), we gave more attention to the EDA section of CyberDeck. This time, we will explore the Dashboard section more thoroughly.\n\nAs we plan to give this product for free, we really need to understand if there will be a need for this among the data scientists. So we couldn't think of a better place than Kaggle. So do let us know if you need this product!\n\nAs a final note, if you like this demo and want to be a contributor, contact us at sagarnil.das@cyberdeck.in\n\n**You can sign up for the Pre-release here:** https://cyberdeck.in/\n\nYou need it?

This allows you to quickly check any hypothesis you might have without actually implementing it which can be very costly.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Dependence\n\nIn this last tab, you will see two plots. The one on the left is again a global feature importance, but this time, it also shows how that variable is affecting survival (in a positive or negative way). The one on the right is a Shap dependence plot which shows us the relation between feature values and SHAP values. This allows you to investigate general relationship between feature value and impact on prediction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://cyberdeck.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/21_dependence_tab.png\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:400px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6. AutoML Conclusion (TL-DC: Too Long, Didn't Code)\n\nWe see that in this whole process, we didn't have to write a single line of code and doing whatever we did here takes at least hundreds of lines of codes. We generated really strong insights from the data via machine learning and explainable AI.\n\nNext, we are going to see the AutoClustering Module of CyberDeck\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# D) Auto Clustering\n\nThis data is a good candidate of clustering. As there are multiple important features here about the Demographical impact of COVID, we would try to cluster this data in an unsupervised manner to see if some data points are similar to each other or not. \n\nFrom our Dashboarding section, we saw that Maharastra and Kerala are big outliers. Hence, we will remove these two data points.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Read the data\n\nWe go to the **Auto Clustering** module of CyberDeck and select the dataset. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://cyberdeck.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/22_clustering_read_data.png\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:400px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As soon as we click on the **Read File** button two things will happen.\n\n1. The file will be read.\n2. An elbow plot will be generated by a default k-means clustering method to notify the user about the optimium number of clusters.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://cyberdeck.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/23_elbow_plot.png\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:400px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Clustering Parameter","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So in here, we see that the Elbow is formed around 3 clusters and hence we can deduce that 3 is the number of optimized clusters to form. In order to choose 3 clusters, we click on the **Clustering Parameter** button. Here we can choose the number of clusters we want along with many other variables. Let's take a look at them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://cyberdeck.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24_clustering_parameter.png\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:400px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So again, just like AutoML, we see that the user will be able to select a plethora of parameters for the clustering. For now, we only change the number of cluster to 3 and keep everything else at its default value. CyberDeck offers a variety of clustering algorithm viz:\n\n1. K-means clustering\n2. K-modes clustering\n3. Affinity propagation clustering\n4. Mean shift clustering\n5. Spectral clustering\n6. Agglomerative clustering\n7. Density based spatial clustering\n8. OPTICS clustering\n9. Birch Clustering\n\nWe hit the **Run Clustering** button now and wait for the algorithm to finish running. After it is finished, we are presented with the following charts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

In the first chart, we see reduced dimension data (via PCA) to see how the clusters look like (color coded) in 2-dimension. Here, we see a good separation between the points which is a good sign.\n2. In the second chart, we see how many datapoints are assigned to each cluster. \n3. In the third plot, we see a TSNE plot in 3-dimension to understand the separation of clusters again.\n\nAll these plots are interactive. Upon hovering on the points, we find out that the states are clustered in the following manner:\n\n* Cluster 0: Uttar pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar etc\n* Cluster 1: Odissa, Telengana, Assam, West Bengal\n* Cluster 2: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu\n\nSo we see that often times, neighbouring states occupy the same cluster in terms of impact of COVID. This is very intuitive as the medical services, rate of spread, immunity etc will be similar for the people of these states.\n\n\n## 4. Gain additional insights\n\nIf we scroll down a little bit on this page, we see that there is a provision for two Scatter charts : 2d and 3d. Users can select different features here and they will automatically get colored by the cluster number. Here, we can get a better understanding of the dependence of different features vs the clustering. \n\n1. In the first plot, we plot Active vs Deaths (colored by Cluster number)\n\n2. In the second plot, we plot Active vs Discharged vs Deaths (colored by Cluster number)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center;\"> <img align=middle src=\"https://cyberdeck.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/26_clustering_viz_2.png\" alt=\"Heat beating\" style=\"height:400px;margin-top:3rem;\"> </div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Clustering conclusion\n\nSo you can see, how many different ways can we approach the problem at hand and what's even more beautiful is every approach opens up a new door of insights and information. All you have to do is think how you want to approach a problem, which is of fundamental value to Data Science and CyberDeck will ease your life as much as it can so that you can spend more time on thinking and less time on coding.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# E) Conclusion\n\nThis marks the end of the first demo of the CyberDeck platform that we are actively building right now. We plan to make this a community product for Data Scientists, by Data Scientists. We would be making the first pre-release around January 2022. So if you think that this product can make your life a little bit easier, then don't forget to sign up at https://www.cyberdeck.in/ and we will get right back as soon as we can!\n\nThat's it for now! Stay tuned till we bring a next demo for CyberDeck!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

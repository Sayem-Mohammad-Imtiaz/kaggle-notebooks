If it wasn't recorded, it's better to replace it with some guess (imputation).\n\n**nfl_data**\nLet's work through an example. Looking at the number of missing values in the nfl_data dataframe, I notice that the column TimesSec has a lot of missing values in it.\nBy looking at the documentation, I can see that this column has information on the number of seconds left in the game when the play was made. This means that these values are probably missing because they were not recorded, rather than because they don't exist. So, it would make sense for us to try and guess what they should be rather than just leaving them as NA's.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other fields, like PenalizedTeam that also have lot of missing fields. In this case, though, the field is missing because if there was no penalty then it doesn't make sense to say which team was penalized. For this column, it would make more sense to either leave it empty or to add a third value like \"neither\" and use that to replace the NA's.\n\n**sf_permit**\n Street Number Suffix has many missing values, the description says it's related to the address. Most likely, NaN in this case means that a suffix for a particular street does not exist. Zipcode variable is a zipcode of building address, NaN means it wasn't recorded."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1e66462cdd41356c747e623526b961000bdd40d1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##Drop missing values\nIf you're in a hurry or don't have a reason to figure out why your values are missing, one option you have is to just remove any rows or columns that contain missing values.

It's usually worth it to take the time to go through your data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know your dataset.)\n\nIf you're sure you want to drop rows with missing values, pandas does have a handy function, dropna() to help you do this.

Eventhough the number of vaccinations is increasing over the world, most vaccines require two or more doses to acquire immunity, and ony some vaccines, such as Janssen Pharmaceutical's, aim to confer immunity in a single dose. Therefore, it is really important to measure the number of people who have completed the required number of vaccinations when assessing overall progress. \n\nIf we look at Israel, in terms of the number of people who have been vaccinated, Israel has inoculated 59.3 people per 100 people on 31 May 2021, which means that more than 1 in 2 people have already been vaccinated in Israel. At the same time, 29 May 2021, about 40.19 per 100 people in United States, and 37 per 100 in UK and Hungry, are fully vaccinated.

6- Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Heart Disease UCI dataset was used in this notebook, first we performed an exploratory data analysis to analyze\nand understand the dataset we have. T have started with a visualization of the missing data, then I start to analyze the \nfeatures one by one. \n\n\nThe mean and the standard deviation of the ages for the people have and dont have the disease  are\nso close for both, and from the means and the histogram we can say that the younger people are more susceptible to disease. \nThe number of males in this dataset is more than twice the number of females, and the number of males that have the\ndisease is higher than females that have the disease the number of males that do not have the disease is higher than\nfemales that have the disease. The most frequent pain type between people have the disease is type 2.\n\n\nthe people havethe disease tend to have a lower resting blood pressure and tend to have a lower serum cholesterol in mg/dl.\nthe number of people that have the disease and fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (class 1) is almost equal to the number of\npeople that do not have the disease and fasting blood sugar < 120 mg/dl (class 0).\n\n\nAlso for the people have the disease the most resting electrocardiographic results type was type 1, and they have number of\nmajor vessels 0 (class 0), also they have the (class 2) of the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\nwhile most of the people dont have the disease have the (class 1)\n\n\nThe correlation between the valriables and the target was studied using Spearman’s ρ and most of the variables was related the \ntarget, some them are positively related and other are negatively.\n\n\nThe data was cleaned from the outliers then  prepared for the macine learning models, the age feature was binned, other numerical features passed through  a pipeline that extract new features then select the best of them using the RFE and \nfinnaly normalized. For the categorical data I used the one_hot encoder to encode them. \n\n\nSeveral Machine learning model were tested the highest testset Accuracy was for the Logistic Regression\nand Hard Voting Classifiers I think that because the data is very simple and small to use a neural network.\nthe second best scores were for Random Forest, Bagging, Pasting, and Neural Network.\n\n\nFinally the Logistic regreesion model was chosen for further analysis and the following metrics were computed: precision_score,\nrecall_score, f1_score, average_precsions_score, roc_auc_score and all of them shown a very good results, all of them\nwere higher than 95%.

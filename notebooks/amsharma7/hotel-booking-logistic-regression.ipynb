You can play with this number if you think it will have serious impact on the prediction rate.\n\nAnother important note to make here is that we just saw the number of features exploding from just 28 to 256. That's a huge number. Generally, more number of features in any dataset leads to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). It simply means that our model will have too many unncessary information to process, which will eventually hamper its processing time and efficiency.\n\nTo avoid the curse of dimensionality, we use something known as [Dimensionality Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) algorithms. One of the most used one is known as [PCA - Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). We are going to use the same. However, one small requirement of PCA is that the data it is applied on should have a sandar scale. Which can be achieved by sklearn's [Standard Scalar](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) function as follows"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsc = StandardScaler()\nX_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = sc.transform(X_test)\nprint(\"X_train ---------->\\n\", X_train, \"\\nX_test -------->\\n\", X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, now all the values are in a standardised scale.\n\nNow, we can safely implement PCA."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\npca = PCA(n_components = 100)\nX_train = pca.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = pca.transform(X_test)\nexplained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Please note that upon running the PCA for the first time, set 'n_components' to 'None' and then evaluate the 'explained_variance' variable for choosing the optimal number of n_components.

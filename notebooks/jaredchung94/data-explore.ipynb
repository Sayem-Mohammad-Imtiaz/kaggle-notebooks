In addition, I look into the changes of rank in countries across the year 2015 to 2020. There can be more detail findings on the data exploration to be done.\n\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nAll data collection (from Kaggle) credit goes to the original Authors:\n\nEditors: John Helliwell, Richard Layard, Jeffrey D.

All seven companies were active by this time.\n* The recession period of 2008-2009 saw acquisitions fall to their lowest point (value-wise) for the previous 4 and the next 7 years.\n* 2010 again saw the revival of the merger cycle, with a number of small companies being acquired.\n* 2011 saw the acquisition of Motorola Mobility by Google and Skype Technologies by Microsoft, pushing the value of acquisitions to a historic high.\n* WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for USD 19 billion. In the same year, Apple acquired Beats Electronics and Google Nest Labs. Google remained the most prolific in the acquisition market.\n* The number of acquisitions has seen a steady faal since 2014. 2016 was highlighted by the Acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft. The value reached a 11-year low in 2017. \n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Value of Acquisitions**\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Hpn0vPd4Hr0U08QUeyg9zcBlyzjAU5yq\">\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GIXebfGpJQPbCqExUMUYV8mOviJeqfXn\">\n \n* The USD 26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft remains the highest-valued to date. This is followed by the USD 19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook.\n* Microsoft is by far the highest spender on acquisitions, followed by IBM and Google.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Monthwise Acquisitions**\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HnbRUNfwJA-4Bfiiw1L47KqygI9FNsxI\">\n\n* The summer months clearly seem to be preferred for making acquisitions.\n* February is historically the least prolific month for acquisitions, followed by November.\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mKi2qp8I-Cu_EMXx_bfDgllnVhB4zRnS\">\n\n* December 2013 was the most prolific month for acquisitions, with a total of 17 acquisitions being made by the 7 companies in question. January and August 204 saw 13 acquisitions each.\n* February 2014 had the greatest value of acquisitions among the high-acquisition-number months, due to the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n**Countrywise Acquisitions**\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fQY1rTxbmYNKfQsZKAIS2f1yqKvN40EX\">\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mYhsC67eDc_gBwyKaUnwzsdCa-wK1Jqu\">\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1a7qXfh2GiZH2D_RGSaX5aqiRPdaB-dOW\">\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cBxGGOChNtLdD7LRmWI5mRo9PK1VyudP\">\n\n* US-based companies have been acquired by the 7 companies in question far greater times than for any country.\n* The value of US-based companies is also far greater than for any other country.\n* Among non-US-based companies, Canadian companies have the greatest number of acquisitions, followed by Israel, the United Kingdom, Germany and France.\n* Among non-US-based companies, Luxemborg has the greatest value of acquisitions due to the USD 8.5 billion acquisition of Skype Technologies by Microsoft, followed by FInland, due to the USD 7.2 billion acquisition of the Nokia mobile phones unit by Microsoft. Canada, Israel, Sweden and the United Kingdom follow.\n* Yearly trends among acquisitions of both US and non-US companies follow similar trends, though the acquisition of non-US companies has increased lately."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

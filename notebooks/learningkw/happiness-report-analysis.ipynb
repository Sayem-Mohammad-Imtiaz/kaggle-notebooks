I used two datasets and you can get access to them from here:https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/data#2019.csv\nYou might notice that there are datasets from 2018 and 2019, but I think that the datasets miss some columns, so I decided not to use them. \n\nQuestions to explore:\n- what are main factors contributing to the increase of Happiness Score?\n- which regions in the world do have the highest average happiness scores? \n- Are there unique facotors contributing to making life evaluation higher in specific regions? \n\nA reason why I chose to work on this project is that since this is very first my personal project(did some guided projects though), I wanted to work on a dataset which does not require me to do a lot of context researches. Moreover, I was interested in those questions listed above. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary ##\nQ1\n- Based on my analysis, all of factors, listed in Happiness Score Report, except generosity contribute to the increse of life evaluation in each country. Especially, gdp_per_capita, family, and health factors are most influential factors of all since their correlatinos with Happiness scores are very strong. \n\nQ2\n- A region, which has the highest average happiness score, is Australia and New Zealand. 2nd is North America, and 3rd is Wesstern Europe. I guess that there is no surprise for this because they are economically prosperous and therefore have environments where people can live in healthy life. \n\nQ3\n- In Southeastern Asia, although gdp_per_capita and family are main factors, freedom and generosity seem to have more influencial to their life evaluation compared with other regions. In other regions, gdp_per_capita and family are main factors contributing to the increase of life evaluation.

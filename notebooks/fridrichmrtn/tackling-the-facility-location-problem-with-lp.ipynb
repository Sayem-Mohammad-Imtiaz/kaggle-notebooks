The state has statistics where emergency problems occurred in last year (data above) and they are not sure whether the emergency stations were placed efficiently. Note that ambulances were sent only to EMS problems. Therefore, they asked us to find places where they should build 5 (of the same size) emergency stations. What will their position be?\n\nThus, we aim to find suitable locations for five emergency facilities based on historical data with linear programming.

Let us have a binary variable $x_{ij}$, for all $i = 1, ..., m$ and for all $j = 1, ..., n$ , where $m$ stands for a number of incident locations and $n$ represents a number of facilities. If $x_{ij} = 1$, than incident $i$ is served from facility $j$, otherwise $x_{ij} = 0 $. Let us have another binary variable $y_{j}$ , for all $j = 1, ..., n$, where $n$ represents the number of facilities. If $y_{j} = 1$, than the facility is open, otherwise $y_{j} = 0$. Now we define cost variables, $d_{ij}$ presents manhattan distance between incident $i$ and facility $j$, $w_{i}$ then shows a number of incidents in location $i$.\n\nWe introduce the problem in the following manner.\n\n**Objective function:** \n\n$min \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} d_{ij} w_{i} x_{ij}$\n\n**Constraints:** \n\n$(1)\\space\\space\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i = 1, ..., m$  \n$(2)\\space\\space\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} = 1, \\forall i = 1, ..., m$  \n$(3)\\space\\space\\space x_{ij} \\leq y_{j}, \\forall i = 1, ..., m, j = 1, ..., n$  \n$(4)\\space\\space\\sum_{j=1}^{n} y_{j} = facility\\_limit$  \n$(5)\\space\\space\\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} w_{i} \\leq capacity\\_limit,\\forall j = 1, ..., n$  \n\nThe objective function minimizes the sum of the weighted distance between incidents and facilities.

However, the solution is somewhat limited. In this section, we describe some of the difficulties & further steps.\n\n**Problem definition** - we might align the solution with the real-world a bit more. Different objective functions can be applied to reflect on that (average time to location/maximum distance traveled/...). Moreover, the feasibility region can be narrowed with further details (time/capacity/location constraints).\n\n**Data** - we build the model on the raster representation (not precise) & use every incident location as a potential facility location (not necessarily good). Both choices might be improved with prior information. Moreover, boundary problems are expected (e.g., there are calls and hospitals adjacent to Montgomery County, which are not acknowledged).\n\n**Sensitivity analysis** - at the end of the CFL, we examine selected components of the model, one at a time; this part of the study can be more thorough. To further challenge our solution, we can do simulations while adding noise to the data/constraints and analyzing the results, leading to better insights.\n\n> Martin Fridrich 08/2019","metadata":{}}]}

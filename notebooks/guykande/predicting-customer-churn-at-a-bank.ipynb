this study i have been dealing with a bank dataset with the aim to predict customers who may churn in the near future to prepare any retention plan after discovering patterns hidden in the dataset, at the beginning there was no clue of what it is happening because the patterns from mean and correlations map couldn't easily provide any clear insight thats where machine learning shows off what it can that our brains can't apparently. we have seen that churning customers in the past were 20,4% this is slightly not a trouble as long as it is low figure compared to the default sample of test data in model testing and this why i have taken 25% default set so that it can cover any biases behind.\n\nRandom forest beat other algorithms because it has the highest accuracy of 0.87 means 87%, referred to no free lunch theorem in machine learning that every machine learning is valid anyway it all depends on the situations and parameters passed to it to bring good results, in our case we can defend Random forest because it has shown its capabilities compared to others as long as we passed same data and same concept to all algorithms, on top of that random forest has a topology of multiple trees and this helps to avoid overfitting the model which is the main problem sometimes in machine learning. note that this model can perform way better if we feed it with more historical datasets this will help the model to capture many and necessary information to provide more accuracy in predictions."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"c6d208200c19b9cb9e92d2d4b64969cb9d6014ad"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Thank

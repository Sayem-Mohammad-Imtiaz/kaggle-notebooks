Through this data I would like to recognize the biggest influence.\nDue to COVID-19 it's hard to get a job now a days. So I think this project will help me what to do to get a nice job and salary.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n1. Library import\n2.

Factor Selection\n4. Verification through ML\n    - Binary Classificaion Problem\n        : As goal of placement is predicting whether students are placed or not this model can be a good prediction model.\n    - Regression Problem\n        : There are several factors influencing salary such as degree, experience etc. Therefore regression analysis may find some relationship between certain factor increase is related to higher salary.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Library import","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas_profiling\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/factors-affecting-campus-placement/Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#brief data information to recognize data type\n\"\"\"\nsl_no= serial number\ngneder\nssc_p= Secondary educaion percentage -

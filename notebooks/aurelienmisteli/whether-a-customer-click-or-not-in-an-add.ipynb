The add-click expresses the percentage of clicks over the total view of the add. It defines your marketing campaign's success. The higher amount of clicks is a signal that your audiences are getting the appropriate commercial/adds and for your company higher Returns on Investment (ROI).

The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative.\n \n* The recall is the ratio TP / (TP + fFN) where TP is the number of true positives and fn the number of false negatives. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.\n\n* The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. \n \n* In multilabel classification, this function computes subset accuracy: the set of labels predicted for a sample must exactly match the corresponding set of labels in y_true."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Interpretation of the confusion matrix:**\n\nFrom the test set, 96% of the consumer's action has been predicted.\nAccording to the precision, the model predicted that a customer would click on the add, that customer click is correct 93% of the time. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Conclusion**\n\nOur model is able to determine if a target client will click not in the add by 96%.\nAccording to our previous analysis, people who are related to click on the add:\n\n- tend to have lower-medium income, between 40.000-50.000\n- generally older, 40 years-old and more\n- spend too much time neither on the website nor on the internet"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"raw","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

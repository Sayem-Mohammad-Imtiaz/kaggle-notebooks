The tasks associated with this dataset were developed and evaluated by global frontline healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers. They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management.\n\nAnalysis of the question:\nPatient population refers to the demographics and other particulars of a population being serviced – for example, a population’s ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or population density.\n\nIndividuals can also be grouped into a patient population based on their health characteristics, such as people with asthma or women who are pregnant.\nhttps://www.paubox.com/blog/patient-population/\n\n\nMethod:\n\nUsing the DS4C dataset, specifically the patient information dataset, I will analyse how different demographic features potentially contribute to the death of COVID-19 patients in South Korea.\n\nPotential areas of analysis:\nAnalysing if the difference in the time between the confirmed date and the released/deceased date is significant between recovered/deceased patients.\n\nAnalysing the dataset only based on the released and deceased dataset, excluding the isolated patients since their outcome is unknown.\n\nInformation on dataset:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/ds4c-what-is-this-dataset-detailed-description","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd                \nimport numpy as np    \n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt     \nimport plotly.express as px       \nimport plotly.offline as py       \nimport seaborn as sns             \nimport plotly.graph_objects as go \nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure, show\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nimport matplotlib.colors as mc\nimport colorsys\nfrom random import randint\nimport re\nimport missingno as msno\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '/kaggle/input/coronavirusdataset/'\n\ncase = p_info = pd.read_csv(path+'Case.csv')\np_info = pd.read_csv(path+'PatientInfo.csv')\np_route = pd.read_csv(path+'PatientRoute.csv')\ntime = pd.read_csv(path+'Time.csv')\nt_age = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeAge.csv')\nt_gender = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeGender.csv')\nt_provin = pd.read_csv(path+'TimeProvince.csv')\nregion = pd.read_csv(path+'Region.csv')\nweather = pd.read_csv(path+'Weather.csv')\nsearch = pd.read_csv(path+'SearchTrend.csv')\nfloating = pd.read_csv(path+'SeoulFloating.csv')\npolicy = pd.read_csv(path+'Policy.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"p_info.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Checking null data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"p_info.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in p_info.columns:\n    msg = 'column: {:>10}\\t Percent of NaN value: {:.2f}%'.format(col, 100 * (p_info[col].isnull().sum() / p_info[col].shape[0]))\n    print(msg)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"msno.matrix(df=p_info.iloc[:, :], figsize=(8,8), color=(0.7,0.9,0.2))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Observations:\n\nThere are quite a bit of data missing.

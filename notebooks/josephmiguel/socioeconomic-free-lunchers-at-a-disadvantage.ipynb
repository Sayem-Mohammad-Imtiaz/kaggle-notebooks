This is obviously not true (with assertion #3), without this program they would not be able to afford lunch and their scores would definitely go down being hungry.\n\n**key finding:  although there was no relationship between lunch and education levels of parents. There was a finding that those who received free/reduced lunches were less likely to get test prep courses.

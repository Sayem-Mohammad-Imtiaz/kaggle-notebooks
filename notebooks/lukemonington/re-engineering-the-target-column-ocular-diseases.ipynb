It doesn't seem like the 'target' column lines up with the N, D, G, C, A, H, M, and O columns. For example in ID 0, the target is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] but the diagnosis is cataract which I think should have been [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Also, for ID 2, the exact same target is present [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] but this time it is normal in both eyes. So the target column seems very unreliable. I think I'm better off just engineering my own target based on the N, D, G, C, A, H, M, and O columns. Also the labels seem off since patient ID 0 says 'N' even though this patient has a cataract. Even more reason to engineer my own features."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"full_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k/full_df.csv')\nfull_df.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Re-engineering the 'target'"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# I'm only going to keep the columns that are actually useful.

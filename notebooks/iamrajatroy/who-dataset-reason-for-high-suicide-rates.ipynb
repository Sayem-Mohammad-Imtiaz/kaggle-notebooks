Annual alcohol consumption in Russia is estimated to be nearly 15 liters per person (Nemtsov 2000, Treml 1997) compared to average rates of about 10 and 7 liters per person in the European Union and the United States, respectively (World Advertising Research Center 2002). The age-standardized suicide rate in Russia in 2000 of about 38 per 100,000 persons was second only to Lithuania and was two to three times higher than the European Union average and in the United States. Violent death, including suicide, was also one of the leading causes of the Russian mortality crisis during the 1990s, especially for males (Notzon et al. 1998, Shkolnikov and MeslÃ© 1996)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"87e634dc4172904945f3389c9bca780df4803e12"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**The dissolution of the Soviet Union occurred on 26 December 1991**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"712b48753cf25c4755334937e9ddf06359f5aa08"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

We break up this effort into multiple steps in order to speed up testing and making changes.  This also uses less memory and is less likely to time out.  \n\nA topic model learns a topic-feature matrix of abstract topics and features (word or ngrams) and a document-topic matrix of documents and topics, from a document-feature matrix of documents and features.  From this factorization we achieve statistical feature vectors for each topic and topic vectors for each document in the training corpus.  We can then find topic vectors for the questions we would like to ask the corpus of documents.  We will use the closest matching documents in the CORD-19 dataset in an attempt to answer the task questions.  LDA assumes a Dirichlet prior on topic-feature and document-topic distributions.  In other words it assumes each topic is defined by and small collection of words or ngrams and that each documnent consists of a small number of topics "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n#for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#    print(dirname)\n#    for filename in filenames:\n#        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Additional Imports"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this section of the code we have additional imports to the standard ones above.

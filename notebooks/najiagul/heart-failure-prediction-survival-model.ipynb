We'll fit a Cox Proportional Hazards model to the data.\n\nCox Proportional Hazards model describes the hazard for an individual $i$ at time $t$ as \n\n$$\n\\lambda(t, x) = \\lambda_0(t)e^{\\theta^T X_i}\n$$\n\nThe $\\lambda_0$ term is a baseline hazard and incorporates the risk over time, and the other term incorporates the risk due to the individual's covariates. After fitting the model, we can rank individuals using the person-dependent risk term $e^{\\theta^T X_i}$.

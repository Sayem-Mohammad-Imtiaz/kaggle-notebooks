Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result. \n\nWe are interested in posts whose titles begin with either \"Ask HN\" or \"Show HN\". Users submit Ask HN posts to the Hacker News Community to ask a specific question. Show HN posts include posts where the user displays a community project, product, or other interesting artifact.\n\nIn this data analysis, we will compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n\n1. Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average.\n2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.\n\nPlease note the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#opening the Hacker News Dataset\nimport csv\n\nfile = open('../input/hacker-news-posts/HN_posts_year_to_Sep_26_2016.csv')\nhn = list(csv.reader(file))\nprint(hn[:5])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Removing Headers from the Printed List"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"headers = hn[0]\nhn = hn[1:]\nprint(headers)\nprint(hn[:5])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above data set contains the following:\n    1.

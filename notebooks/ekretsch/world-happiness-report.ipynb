Online courses and lectures do a great job in feeding you valuable knowledge but do you actually understand? If you are the person who read through a math textbook without lifting a pen, you are not alone! People tend to assume they know something but the only way to prove it is applying. In this walkthrough I will guide you and explain it to you as much as possible. If you still have any question please message me or drop the question on discord. This is not a perfect notebook. There may be flaws or errors and I do apologise beforehand. Kindly let me know and I will fix it immediately.\n\n### Context \nThis dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). I have modified the data to contain only data from 2015 to 2017. This report ranks 155 countries by their happiness level through 6 indicators:\n\n- economic production\n- social support\n- life expectancy \n- freedom \n- absence of corruption\n- generosity\n\nThe last indicator is dystopia residual. Dystopia residual is \"the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country\".  Dystopia is a made up country that has the world's least happiest people. This made up country is high in corruption, low in average income, employment, etc. Dystopia residual is used as a benchmark and should be used side-by-side with the happiness score. \n- Low dystopia residual = low level of happiness \n- high dystopia residual = high level of happiness.\n\n### Understanding the column data\n- Country\n- Happiness rank \n- Happiness score \n * This is obtained from a sample of population. The survey-taker asked the respondent to rate their happiness from 1 to 10. \n- Economic (GDP per cap)\n * Extend of GDP that contributes to the happiness score\n- Family\n * To what extend does family contribute to the happiness score \n- Health\n * Extend of health (life expectancy) contribute to the happiness score \n- Freedom\n * Extend of freedom that contribute to happiness. The freedom here represents the freedom of speech, freedom to pursue what we want, etc\n- Trust (Government corruption)\n * Extend of trust with regards to government corruption that contribute to happiness score \n- Generosity \n * Extend of generosity that contribute to happiness score \n- dystopia residual\n- Year\n\n#### Do note:\n$ Happiness Score = Economic (GDP per cap) + Family + Health + Freedom + Trust + Generosity + Dystopia Residual $\n\n## Let's get started!"},{"metadata":{"id":"09TulspcO-gT","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"MudjIXQsQ2v2","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Explanation of packages (feel free to skip if you are familiar)\n### Pandas\nPandas works great on tabular (presented in tables or columns) data.

It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. In short, it allows you to make quick plot with just a line of code and you do not need to worry about customisation of plots (eg: working with colour palette). We will be using Seaborn for most of our plots and do feel free to use matplotlib if you are comfortable with that. I usually use matplotlib when I need to customise the plot to my flavor. \n- I will describe seaborn as an auto

From the plot if we look at the second column from the left (Happiness score on x-axis), we do notice that econimic, family and health have positive linear correlation.

Besides Pearson distribution, you get to choose between Kendall and Spearman.\n\n### Pearson distribution\nPearson's correlation is a measure of the linear relationship between two continuous random variables. A perfect positive linear correlation will be 1. If value on x increases, value of y increases. A perfect negative correlation is -1. If X increases, Y decrease. Before we run any stats model we need to look into the assumptions.\n#### Assumptions for Pearson\n- Each variable needs to be continuous and not discrete. Continuous values have decimals and has a scale. Things like weight and height are continuous (10.02 KG, 1.002 cm). Decrete are fix numbers. Things like I saw 2 eggs on the table or number of visits to the doctor (1,2,3,etc). No such thing as I saw 3.42 eggs on the table or I have visited the doctor 4.3 times this year.\n- Next is related pair. Related pairs refers to the pairs of variables. Each participant or observation should have a pair of values. So if the correlation was between GPA and SAT score, then each observation used should have both a GPA and a SAT value. Using this example I can only include Peter, Tom and Sam into the sample if they have both GPA and SAT score. If Sam only has GPA, I can't use Pearson.\n- No outliers. Absence of outliers refers to not having outliers in either variable. Having an outlier can skew the results of the correlation by pulling the line of best fit formed by the correlation too far in one direction or another.  Typically, an outlier is defined as a value that is 3.29 standard deviations from the mean,or a standardized value of less than ±3.29.\n- Linearity and homoscedasticity refer to the shape of the values formed by the scatterplot. For linearity, a “straight line” relationship between the variable should be formed.  If a line were to be drawn between all the dots going from left to right, the line should be straight and not curved. Homoscedasticity refers to the distance between the points to that straight line. The shape of the scatterplot should be tube-like in shape. If the shape is cone-like, then homoskedasticity would not be met. \n\nCredit to [S.SWAIN](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/S_Swain2) from Researchgate that did a wonderful explanation! \n\nFor this practice, we will just work with Pearson."},{"metadata":{"id":"aKtTB50YrhVy","colab_type":"code","outputId":"641e59a6-7814-4685-8596-b3a612a09474","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":111},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a list of attributes we want (just copy the column name)\necon_happiness = ['Happiness Score','Economy (GDP per Capita)']\n\n# Creating a dataframe that only contains these attributes\necon_corr = data[econ_happiness]\n\n# Finding correlation\necon_corr.corr()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"idtYP_QEysVm","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What do we see here?\n- Before we interpret the result we need to ask ourselves how high should the correlation coefficient be to be significant.

About 50% of all bookings are cancelled.\n3. 2016 showed the highest rate of hotel bookings. (data from 2015-2017)\n4. Highest daily rates occurred in the summer (June, July, August)\n5. More bookings occured on weekdays vs weekends.\n6. Bookers with children or babies booked at resorts at a higher rate.\n7. UK, France, and Portugal booked the most hotel stays worldwide.\n8. Majority of hotel bookings did not require a deposit.\n9. Most bookings came from independent, transient customers.\n10. >90% of bookings were not return guests.\n\n# Discussion:\nAnalysis of this dataset highlights a few key take-aways. First, there is a disproportianate amount of cancellations on hotel bookings (~50%). Bookers are not required to send in a deposit in most bookings which could explain the high rate of cancellations. There are more bookings on weekdays, this data suggests that hotel business could be improved by targeting working travelers or improving daily rates for weekdays. Although resorts only account for 1/3 of all bookings, they out-compete city hotels when there is a baby in the booking group. Resort hotels could target young families with this knowledge by appealing to customers looking for a safe, family atmosphere. Europe has a high amount of travelers that book both resort and city hotels. European business typically has more holiday vacation time for workers and aggressive marketing campaigns could be made in this region to corner this market. Resort hotels have a steep rise in price during busy summer seasons, knowing this information city hotels would potentially raise their daily rate (So long as they are not competing against each other). Lastly, most bookings came from independent travelers and there is a significantly low rate of return (<10%). Hotels should take efforts to improve relationships with customers or target past guests for return stays.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

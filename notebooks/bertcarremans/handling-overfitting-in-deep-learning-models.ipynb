In other words, the model learnt patterns specific to the training data, which are irrelevant in other data.\n\nWe can identify overfitting by looking at validation metrics, like loss or accuracy. Usually the validation metric stops improving after a certain number of epochs and begins to decrease afterwards. The training metric continues to improve because the model seeks to find the best fit for the training data.\n\nThere are several manners in which we can reduce overfitting in deep learning models. The best option is to ***get more training data***. Unfortunately, in real-world situations you often do not have this possibility due to time, budget or technical constraints.\n\nAnother way to reduce overfitting is to ***lower the capacity of the model to memorize the training data***. As such, the model will need to focus on the relevant patterns in the training data, which results in better generalization. In this post we'll discuss three options to achieve this."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"daa04c95a6b8cd6ad81e915d1389a9eaff4e07ef"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Set-up of the project\nWe start by importing the necessary packages and configuring some parameters.

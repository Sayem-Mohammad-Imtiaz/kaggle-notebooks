Well, there is no reason to panic, but its defintely a matter of concern. \nIts because, it will take more than one year to derieve any cure for the virus. \nIn the mean time, it's our immune system that will have to fight. \nSo, stay clean and eat healthy.\n\n\n### The Dataset\nBased on dataset available which contains geographical and medical records, we will learn the impact of Corona Virus through exploratory data analysis with special focus on China. \n\n*Please Note:* I have just started on this notebook. So,please feel free to comment and provide feedback to improve the notebook.

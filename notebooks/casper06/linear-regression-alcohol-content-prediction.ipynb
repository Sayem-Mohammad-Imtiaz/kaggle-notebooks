Moreover, try to find how accurately we can predict Alcohol content. \n\nBefore starting the analysis let me give you a brief introduction about the technique that we are going to use. We are going to use multiple linear regressions and linear Regression is a simple approach for supervised learning. In particular, Linear Regression is a useful tool for prediction a quantitavie response. Linear Regression can be perfomed as a Simple Linear Regression or Multiple Linear Regression. Both simple and multiple linear regressions assume that there is approximately a linear relationship between the inputs(X) and the output(Y). The main difference is the number of independent variables that they take as inputs(X). Simple linear regression just takes a single input(X), while multiple linear regression takes multiple inputs(X). Mathamatically we can write multiple linear regression as:\n\n$$ Y = W_0 + W_1X_1 + W_2X_2 + ... + W_nX_n $$ \n\nI'm not going to discuss more linear regression here, there are plenty of very good articles available so you can check them if you want to gain your knowledge about linear regression. In this task, our output variable (target variable in machine learning or the dependent variable in statistical modeling) is Alcohol content and all other inputs (features in machine learning or independent variables in statistical modeling) are input variables.

Let's address the next issue.\n\n### 2. Fix Normality of the Error Terms\n\nLet's measure the skewness of the selected variables, if skewness is 0, the data are perfectly symmetrical, although it is quite unlikely for real-world data. As a general rule of thumb:\n* If skewness is less than - 1 or greater than 1, the distribution is highly skewed.\n* If skewness is between - 1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1, the distribution is moderately skewed.\n* If skewness is between - 0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#skewness and kurtosis\ndef skew(columns, df):\n    dfs = df[columns].agg(['skew', 'kurtosis']).transpose()\n    for index, row in dfs.iterrows():\n        if (abs(row['skew']) > 1):\n            dfs.loc[index,'label'] = 'highly skewed'\n        elif (0.5 < abs(row['skew']) < 1):\n            dfs.loc[index,'label'] = 'moderately  skewed'\n        else:\n            dfs.loc[index,'label'] = 'approximately symmetric'\n        \n    return dfs\n\ncolumns = ['citric acid','residual sugar','density', 'sulphates']\nskew(columns, df)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.547829Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.548113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.573551Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.548084Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.572517Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see two variables are not normally distributed, to further confirm this we can conduct the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n\nShapiro-Wilk uses below hypothesis:\n* H0 = The sample comes from a normal distribution.\n* H1 = The sample is not coming from a normal distribution.\n\nIf the data is not normalized, we can apply a transformation to convert skewed distribution to a normal distribution/less-skewed distribution.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Shapiro-Wilk test\ndef shapiroWilk(columns, df):\n    data = []\n\n    for column in columns:\n        stat, p = shapiro(df[column])\n        if (p < 0.05):\n            label = 'The null hypothesis can be rejected.'\n        else:\n            label = 'The null hypothesis cannot be rejected.'\n\n        data.append([column, stat, p, label])\n\n    return pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['column', 'statistic', 'p-value', 'label'])\n    \n\ncolumns = ['residual sugar', 'sulphates']\nshapiroWilk(columns, df)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.574731Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.575007Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.591937Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.57498Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.590925Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def transformDistribution(columns, method):\n    fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, nrows=len(columns), figsize=(10, 8))\n    fig.tight_layout(pad=4)\n    \n    for i, column in enumerate(columns):\n        if method == 'sqrt':\n            trans = np.sqrt(df[column])\n        elif method == 'log':\n            trans = np.log10(df[column]+1)\n        else:\n            trans, params = stats.boxcox(df[column]+1)\n    \n        sns.distplot(df[column], ax=axes[i][0])\n        sns.distplot(trans, ax=axes[i][1])\n\n        axes[i][0].set_title('Distribution of {0}'.format(column))\n        axes[i][1].set_title('Distribution of {0} (log)'.format(column))\n        axes[i][1].set_xlabel('{0} (log)'.format(column))\n        \n    plt.show()\n    \ntransformDistribution(['residual sugar', 'sulphates'], 'log')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.593005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.593421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.458936Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T08:47:55.59339Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.457848Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df['residual_sugar_log'] = np.log(df['residual sugar'])\ndf['sulphates_log'] = np.log(df['sulphates'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.460081Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.460368Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.467131Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.46034Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.466092Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"skew(['residual_sugar_log', 'sulphates_log'], df)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.46862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.469022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.492693Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.468977Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T08:47:56.49172Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ok, after log transformation distributions are approximately symmetric.

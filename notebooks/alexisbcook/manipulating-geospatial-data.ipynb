We refer to this way of joining data (by simpling matching values in the index) as an **attribute join**.\n\nWhen performing an attribute join with a GeoDataFrame, it's best to use the `gpd.GeoDataFrame.merge()`.  To illustrate this, we'll work with a GeoDataFrame `europe_boundaries` containing the boundaries for every country in Europe.  The first five rows of this GeoDataFrame are printed below."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true},"outputs":[],"source":"\nworld = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))\neurope = world.loc[world.continent == 'Europe'].reset_index(drop=True)\n\neurope_stats = europe[[\"name\", \"pop_est\", \"gdp_md_est\"]]\neurope_boundaries = europe[[\"name\", \"geometry\"]]"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"europe_boundaries.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"We'll join it with a DataFrame `europe_stats` containing the estimated population and gross domestic product (GDP) for each country."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"europe_stats.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"We do the attribute join in the code cell below.

With a spatial join, we combine GeoDataFrames based on the spatial relationship between the objects in the \"geometry\" columns.  For instance, we already have a GeoDataFrame `universities` containing geocoded addresses of European universities.  \n\nThen we can use a spatial join to match each university to its corresponding country.  We do this with `gpd.sjoin()`."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# Use spatial join to match universities to countries in Europe\neuropean_universities = gpd.sjoin(universities, europe)\n\n# Investigate the result\nprint(\"We located {} universities.\".format(len(universities)))\nprint(\"Only {} of the universities were located in Europe (in {} different countries).\".format(\n    len(european_universities), len(european_universities.name.unique())))\n\neuropean_universities.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The spatial join above looks at the \"geometry\" columns in both GeoDataFrames.  If a Point object from the `universities` GeoDataFrame intersects a Polygon object from the `europe` DataFrame, the corresponding rows are combined and added as a single row of the `european_universities` DataFrame.  Otherwise, countries without a matching university (and universities without a matching country) are omitted from the results.\n\nThe `gpd.sjoin()` method is customizable for different types of joins, through the `how` and `op` arguments.  For instance, you can do the equivalent of a SQL left (or right) join by setting `how='left'` (or `how='right'`).  We won't go into the details in this micro-course, but you can learn more in [the documentation](http://geopandas.org/reference/geopandas.sjoin.html).\n\n# Your turn\n\n**[Use geocoding and table joins](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/5832170)** to identify suitable locations for the next Starbucks Reserve Roastery."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}

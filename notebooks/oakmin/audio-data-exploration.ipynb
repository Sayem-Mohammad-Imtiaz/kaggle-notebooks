Tzanetakis and P. Cook in _IEEE Transactions on Audio and Speech Processing_ in 2002, a journal for the \"science, technologies and applications that relate to the analysis, coding, enhancement, recognition and synthesis of audio, music, speech and language\".\nThe songs were all pulled from personal CDs, radio, microphone recordings, in order to represent a variety of recording conditions, and are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format.\n\n## Data Source 2\n\nWe also added in our own dataset of songs downloaded from Youtube Playlists by genre using a command line program. These are upwards of 60+ songs for each genre and are also all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format. These are all also cut down to only 30 second snippets using the Digital Audio Workstation _Ableton_.\n\nA lot of these songs are similar to each other in time released, as for example many of the rap songs from the same playlist came out around similar times. To get a more well rounded dataset, I will soon download more playlists from older or newer music from the genre. Our existing GTZAN dataset has mostly old music, as it is from 2002.\n\nThe features for this data will be generated by us later on in the exploration and encorporated into the GTZAN Dataset."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Source 1"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's begin by printing the head of our entire dataframe.

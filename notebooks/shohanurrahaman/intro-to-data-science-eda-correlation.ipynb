It quantifies the strength of the relationship. For instance, we know that the weight and height of a person are correlated. Taller people tend to have more weight. Hence, we say that height and weight are correlated.\n\nCorrelation is measured in terms of a number called correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1. The value of 1 or -1 denotes complete correlation, while 0 indicates that no correlation is present between the two variables. Negative values mean there is an inverse relationship between the two variables, while a positive value denotes a direct relationship.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset/UCI_Credit_Card.csv')\ncorrelation = df.corr()\nprint(correlation)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we can see here a list of correlation value, it is very difficult to study let's create a **Heatmap** of correlation that is much easier to study.

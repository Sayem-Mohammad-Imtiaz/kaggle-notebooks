It is followed by Experience Difference, Total Gold, Total Experience, KDA's. Wonderfull! Let's make conclusions by those findings.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As I said in the beginning of the analysis, myself is an ex Diamond 2 League of Legends player. This data contains top %0.4 players which are called as 'High-Elo Players' among League players. When you are in high-elo in League, you usually play with the same players most of the time because there is not much high-elo players. That means, most of players know their opponents in the game, their gamestyle, their warding times, their reactions to repeated ganks from junglers, etc. It is so much different from low-elo games where you play with different people every game. Knowing you opponent really impacts the playstyle of players. In League of Legends, there are so many little things to consider beyond our analysis here which contains so little information to begin with. \n\n\nLet's consider correlation table. It says, gold difference between people is the single most important thing in winning the game. That is of course true, because if you have more golds then you can buy more items and become more powerfull than your enemies. But how can you get more golds from your opponents? By krilling you enemies is one answer, especially in low-elo games, most of the players will tell you this. What about high-elo players? In high-elo unlike low-elo, players play the game more macro style, which means seeing the big picture. They don't try to kill their enemies, of course if they can they do, they try to gain advantage with little wins rather than killing enemies. What are those little wins? You can get better base timing by manipulating minions better than your opponent and by winning those 30-40 seconds can help your team secure first dragon. If you are in bot lane, pushing your lane means your jungler can have enemy team's bot side jungle. etc. Those little victories over your enemy helps you win the game.\n\n\nI am not trying to explain League of Legends' macro gameplan or make you understand how you win the game. I haven't played the game for months actually. What I am trying to say is *DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THINK*. If I wasn't a League player myself, I would just say 'Look at the correlation plot. Warding has 0.000087 correlation with Blue Team winning the game. It means nothing.'. Although seems like it has very little correlation with winning, I know that it is one of the most important thing in game. Because I know that, without warding, you can't get herald or dragons and getting elite monsters has a huge impact on winning the game. Maybe great data scientist who has long time experince would still understand this without domain knowledge, but junior data scientists like me, most of the time, wouldn't understand the importance of warding. This EDA really made me understand how important to have domain knowledge. From now on, when I am working on a dataset what I have little to no domain knowledge, before getting to work, I will try to learn about dataset's domain.\n\n\nThis EDA was really great experince for me. I really enjoyed it and I hope you enjoyed it too. I will be waiting for your feedback which is really important for my improvement. Thank you very much.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Ban Yasuo Please!!!","metadata":{}}]}

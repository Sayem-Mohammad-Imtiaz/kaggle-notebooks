Change Column Types\n\nI even use apply to change the column types since I don't want to remember the syntax for changing column type and also since it lets me do much more complex things. \nThe normal syntax to change column type is astype in Pandas. So if I had a column named price in my data in an str format. I could do this:\n\n```df['Price'] = newDf['Price'].astype('int')```\n\nBut sometimes it won't work as expected. \nYou might get the error: ValueError: invalid literal for long() with base 10: '13,000'. That is you cannot cast a string with \",\" to an int. To do that we first have to get rid of the comma. \nAfter facing this problem time and again, I have stopped using astype altogether now and just use apply to change column types.\n\n```df['Price'] = df.apply(lambda x: int(x['Price'].replace(',', '')),axis=1)```"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### d.

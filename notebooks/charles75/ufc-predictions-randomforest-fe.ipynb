The UFC's fighters are usually considered as the best in the world, they often came from different organisations and got promoted there after a long road. People have always wanted to predict the winner of those kind of fights and even more today as bettings on such games are now becoming huge. To be able to predict (showing probabilities) the final result of a UFC match could be a good betting decision helper and therefore making fights even more exciting to watch. \n\nThe special thing about this dataset to keep in mind is that each row is a compilation of both fighter statistics UP UNTIL THIS FIGHT (and this is very important to understand !).

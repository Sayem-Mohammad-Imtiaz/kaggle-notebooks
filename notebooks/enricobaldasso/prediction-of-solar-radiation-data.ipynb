This means that they are based on the combination of a set of simple models, which together lead to a more robust and accurate prediction model. \n\nGiven that this set of models is more complex than the simple linear regression, some parameters (hyper-parameters) have to be user-specified before the model can be trained. The proper selection of these parameter is of uttermost importance in order to attain a suitable model. This selection process is generally called \"hyper-parameter tuning\" and it is here carried out by means of a grid-search approach: a list of potential values for the various hyper-parameters is defined and then multiple models are trained as a way to identify the best performing set of hyper-parameters.\n\nThe first model to be considered is Random Forest."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Initiating Random Forest regressor\nrf_model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state = 42)\n\n#Define the grid of hyperparameters\nparams_rf = {\n    'n_estimators': [500, 600, 700],\n    'max_depth': [5, 6, 7],\n    'min_samples_leaf': [0.075, 0.05, 0.025],\n    'max_features': ['log2', 'sqrt']   \n}\n\n\n#Initiate Grid search\ngrid_rf = GridSearchCV(estimator = rf_model,\n                       param_grid = params_rf,\n                       cv = 3,\n                       scoring = 'neg_mean_squared_error',\n                       verbose = 1,\n                       n_jobs = -1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Fitting the grid search\ngrid_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Extracting best hyperparameters\nrf_best_hyperparams = grid_rf.best_params_\nprint('Best hyperparameters for RF: \\n', rf_best_hyperparams)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Extracting best rf model\nrf = grid_rf.best_estimator_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Given that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are complex models, the chances of overfitting the training set are considerable. When a model is overfitting the training set, it does fit not only its trends, but also its noise. Therefore, an overfitted model will perform poorly on unseen data.\n\nA way to check whether the model overfits the training set is to carry out a cross-validation procedure. During the cross-validation procedure, the training set is split into k folds, and the model is trained k times using a different portion of data from the training set. Each trained model will have a different prediction accuracy. The average error of the models trained during the cross validation procedure is defined \"cross-validation\" error.\n\nTwo scenarios are possible:\n1. The cross-validation error is greater than the training set error -> in this case the model is overfitting the training set;\n2.

Carry out a more estensive hyper-parameter tuning procedure (a simple gride search of few parameters was here carried out);\n2. Consider to limit the evaluations to the only hours of the day when the solar radiation is present (this allows to build a model that does not have to account for the night hours);\n3.

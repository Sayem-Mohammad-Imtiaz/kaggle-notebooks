Yet, as a current Chicago resident, I still have a lot of unanswered questions. In this notebook, I will explore crimes in Chicago from a perspective of a Chicago resident who wants to know more about the subject so he can better navigate his way through the city.\n\n### Little introduction and motivation\n\n**Crime in Chicago** is a very interesting topic for exploration for all kinds of reasons. Personally, I have been living in Chicago for a couple of months and crime here is always a topic of conversation with friends and family. Another reason is the availability of huge amounts of publicly available (high quality) crime datasets open for data scientists to mine and investigates such as this one.\n\nIn this notebook, I am going to explore more about crime in Chicago and try to answer few questions:\n\n - How has crime in Chicago changed across years? Was 2016 really [the bloodiest year in two decades][1]?\n - Are some types of crimes more likely to happen in specific locations or specific time of the day or specific day of the week than other types of crimes? \n\n  [1]: http://www.newsweek.com/2016/12/23/chicago-gangs-violence-murder-rate-532034.html"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2d53af66-f785-0e26-b0a5-faf5f3314643","_uuid":"ade39928593c1381397a696da666dc2f13f1e7f0"},"source":"First, we import the required data science packages and get the data.

Although it may not be very clear from the previous chart how crime have changed over the years, it still gives somehow similar numbers between 2015 and 2016. Here, we will take a finer scale to get the visualization right. I decided to look at the rolling sum of crimes of the past year. The idea is, for each day, we calculate the sum of crimes of the past year. If this rolling sum is decreasing, then we know for sure that crime rates have been decreasing during that year.

For each set of those pots, I re-scaled counts of crime records in each hour within each crime type to be z-scaled (to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation). So it is a \"within-type/ across-hours\" scaling that aims to show differences between frequencies of crimes at different hours. All types have the save \"average\" of crime counts, but not all hours have the same average. So a negative value indicate a lower frequency while a positive value indicate a higher frequency for that crime to occur in a particular hour.\n\nFirst, let's see if there are \"day crimes vs night crimes\" thing.

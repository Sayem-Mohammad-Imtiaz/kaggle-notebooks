In simple words, BERT is like a hash-mapping function. It maps arbitrary length sentences ( presented as tokens ) to fixed-length word-vectors, These word-vectors are n-dimensional numerical values. These word-vectors contain enough information to semantically present the given sentence. How BERT was able to generate this? It was able to do so because it has developed a language model of the data it was trained on. How it developed the language model is quite complex and is outside the scope of the notebook, You can refer to BERT research paper to understand more.

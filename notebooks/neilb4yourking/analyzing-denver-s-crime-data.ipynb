I reached out to the city of Denver and received clarification on several of the columns. I will briefly describe each column below. I will go slightly out of order to provide a more cohesive explanation\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>OFFENSE_ID</b> is a unique identifier for each offense. It is generated by concatanating (combining) the INCIDENT_ID, OFFENSE_CODE,and OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION. It provides a unique identifier for each offense, as the INCIDENT_ID is duplicated if multiple offenses are committed at once, and OFFENSE_CODE and OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION will repeat whenever a particular type of offense is committed\n\n<b>INCIDENT_ID</b> is a unique identifier for an occurence of offenses. most OFFENSE_ID's have unique INCIDENT_ID's, but when a person commits multiple offenses at once, e.g. liquor possession and heroine possession, multiple OFFENSE_ID's will be generated from the INCIDENT_ID\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CODE</b> is a unique identifier for a particular type of offense. things such as criminal mischief, trespassing, larceny, etc. all have different OFFENSE__CODE values to identify them\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CODE_EXTENSION</b> are used to describe a subset of another type crime. for example criminal_mischief- motor vehicle and criminal_mischief-other have the same OFFENSE_CODE but different extensions to differentiate them\n\n<b>OFFENSE_TYPE_ID</b> provides the actual name for the offense in lamens terms. each combination of OFFENSE_CODE and OFFENSE_EXTENSION reference a unique crime. contents of this column include things such as theft-shoplift, criminal-trespassing, and threats-to-injure\n\n<b>OFFENSE_CATEGORY_ID</b> provides a more general categorization for crimes. for example, theft-shoplift and theft-from-bldg are both forms of larceny\n\n<b>FIRST_OCCURENCE_DATE</b> is the first possible date/time of the offense. if the time of the offense is known, the LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE will have value NaN. if the time is not known, FIRST_OCCURENCE_DATE will note the first possible time for the offense, and LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE will be last possible time of the offense. This commonly occurs with burglaries, where the exact time of the offense may not be known, but a range of time is known\n\n<b>LAST_OCCURENCE_DATE</b> will be NaN if the exact time of the offense is known and will be an actual time if only a range of possible times is known. in the latter case, it will be the last possible time the offense could have occured.\n\n<b>REPORTED_DATE</b> is the time at which the offense was reported to the police\n\n<b>INCIDENT_ADDRESS</b> provides the location of the offense. not all entries have a value for this column for privacy reasons\n\n<b>GEO_LON</b> and <b>GEO_LAT</b> are the latitudes and longitudes of the location of the offense\n\n<b>GEO_X</b> and <b>GEO_Y</b> are the state plane (city of Denver standard projection) for the offense location. functionally simlar to GEO_LON and GEO_LAT\n\n<b>DISTRICT_ID</b> is the district in charge of handling the offense\n\n<b>PRECINCT_ID</b> is the precinct in charge of handling the offense\n\n<b>NEIGHBORHOOD_ID</b> is the neighborhood the offense occurred in\n\n<b>IS_CRIME</b> states whether the offense was a crime\n\n<b>IS_TRAFFIC</b> states whether the offense was a traffic incident\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0332c339473817d969d424d457c1da3d9cf5fa95"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>\n<br>\nNow that we have an overview of the data, II'll make sure it contains no errors.

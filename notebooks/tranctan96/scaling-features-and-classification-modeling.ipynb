in magnitudes, units and range. But since, most of the machine learning algorithms use Eucledian distance between two data points in their computations, this is a problem.\n\nIf left alone, these algorithms only take in the magnitude of features neglecting the units. The results would vary greatly between different units, 5kg and 5000gms. The features with high magnitudes will weigh in a lot more in the distance calculations than features with low magnitudes.\n\nTo supress this effect, we need to bring all features to the same level of magnitudes. This can be acheived by scaling.\n\nSince both of KNN and SVM utitlize distance calculation behind the scene, we need to scale our features so that the large-valued features do not dominate the other features. More can be referenced [here](https://medium.com/greyatom/why-how-and-when-to-scale-your-features-4b30ab09db5e) and [here](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_about_feature_scaling.html#about-standardization).\n\n**Notice**: It is worth trying not scaling the features. So that we can see that for SVM,\n- The training time is very long (computationally expensive)\n- The model overfits\n\n### Multiple ways to scale\n- **Standard Scaler (Standardization)**: Scale the feature by shifting the mean back to 0 and variance to 1. By this way, we only shift the mean value to 0 and keep the distribution the same. Furthermore, this way can presereve the outliers in case they can contribute additional information to the problem.\n- **Min-max Scaler (Normalization)**: This one scales the range of values to between 0 and 1 and also eliminates the outliers.\n- Read more:\n    -

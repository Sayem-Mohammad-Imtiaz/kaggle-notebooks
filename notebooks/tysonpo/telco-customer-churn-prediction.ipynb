This equates to correctly identifying 80% of customer churn cases, while unnecessarily targeting loyal customers 50% of the time. Assuming reasonable actions are taken, i.e. emailing the customer an offer, this model could be leveraged to improve customer satisfcation. \n\nFor other models, logistic regression and random forest also performed well. Naive Bayes, SVM, and KNN did not perform well, possibly in part due to the large number of categorical variables. Our EDA indicated that factors like gender and phone service do not impact customer churn.  Internet service, paperless billing, and whether the customer was a senior citizen or not all were related to churn. The feature importances from our model further indicate that internet service (or not) is a dominating factor in why customers stay or leave.\n\nFuture work should explore multivariate relationships relevant to churn (are senior citizens and no-internet separate causes of churn or do senior citizens not use internet as often?). More advanced models could be built, such as neural network models. Furthermore, advanced hyperparameter optimization methods (see hypopt package) should be preferred over random/grid-search. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions! 😊"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

International transport - refers to aviation and shipping that contributes to global CO2 emissions\n    4. Statistical differences - refers to the difference between global emissions and the sum of all national emissions plus bunker fuels.\n*  There are missing values in the `Code` column and since we are not going to use this column during  visualization, we will drop this instead.\n* Adding new columns to the dataframe: \n    1. `Annual_Emissions` - derived from column `Annual CO₂ emissions (tonnes )` divided by 1 Billion. This will give us a smaller range to work on. Note that the unit for this column is `billion tonnes`.\n    2. `DT_Year` - derived from `Year` column.\n* Removing columns:\n    1. `Code` - there are many missing values in this column; this column is not critical to visualization since it only contains codes unique to each country.\n    2. `Annual CO₂ emissions (tonnes )` - this has a very wide range (between 0 - 36 Billion) and is not ideal in visualization as it affects the scaling. \n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport altair as alt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/co2-ghg-emissionsdata/co2_emission.csv',parse_dates=['Year'])\ndf['Annual_Emissions'] = df['Annual CO₂ emissions (tonnes )']/1000000000\ndf.drop(['Annual CO₂ emissions (tonnes )', 'Code'],axis=1, inplace=True)\ndf['DT_Year']=df.Year.dt.year\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create separate dataframe consisting continent/region\nI have included China, United States, and International transport in this data because they have significant amount of CO2 emissions."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create separate dataframes for each continent\nmideast = df[df['Entity'] == 'Middle East']\nafrica = df[df['Entity'] == 'Africa']\namericas = df[df['Entity'] == 'Americas (other)']\napac = df[df['Entity'] == 'Asia and Pacific (other)']\neuro = df[df['Entity'] == 'EU-28']\neurope = df[df['Entity'] == 'Europe (other)']\nusa = df[df['Entity'] == 'United States']\nchina = df[df['Entity'] == 'China']\ntransport = df[df['Entity'] == 'International transport']\nworld = df[df['Entity'] == 'World']\n\nconts = [africa, americas, apac, euro, europe, mideast, usa, china, transport, world]\ncontinents = pd.concat(conts)\nprint(continents['Entity'].unique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Create separate dataframe for G20 countries"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"g20 = df.query(\"Entity == ['Argentina', 'Australia', 'Brazil', 'Canada', 'Saudi Arabia','China', 'France', 'Germany', 'India', 'United States','Indonesia', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Russia','South Africa', 'South Korea', 'Turkey', 'United Kingdom', 'Spain']\")\nprint(g20['Entity'].unique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Visualization"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### By Region\nBelow area graph shows the trend of CO2 emissions through the course of time.\n* From 1830, CO2 emission in the United States and EU were increasing.

The difference is that XgBoost algorithm is developed with both deep consideration in terms of systems optimization and principles in machine learning. The goal of the library is to push the extreme of the computation limits of machines to provide a scalable, portable and accurate library.

It is less widely used than bagging and boosting. Unlike bagging and boosting, stacking may be (and normally is) used to combine models of different types.\n\nThe point of stacking is to explore a space of different models for the same problem. The idea is that you can attack a learning problem with different types of models which are capable to learn some part of the problem, but not the whole space of the problem. So you can build multiple different learners and you use them to build an intermediate prediction, one prediction for each learned model. Then you add a new model which learns from the intermediate predictions the same target. This final model is said to be stacked on the top of the others, hence the name. Thus you might improve your overall performance, and often you end up with a model which is better than any individual intermediate model."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from mlxtend.classifier import StackingCVClassifier\n\nsclf = StackingCVClassifier(classifiers=[knn, rf, xgb, gbm], \n                          meta_classifier=rf)\n\nprint('10-fold cross validation:\\n')\n\nfor clf, label in zip([knn, rf, xgb, gbm, rf], \n                      ['KNearest Neighbors',\n                       'Random Forest', \n                        'XGB','GBM',\n                       'MetaClassifier']):\n\n    sclf_scores = model_selection.cross_val_score(clf, X, Y,\n                                              cv=10, scoring='accuracy')\n    print(\"Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f) [%s]\" % (sclf_scores.mean(), sclf_scores.std(), label))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"607442a1bbc278e4f8b2e238d3e611aa9ef0d359"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summarize results\nWe run the algorithms once again using StratifiedK-fold cross-validation and summarize our findings.

This is an extension that is not part of this notebook.\n\nWe end the analysis with classification report of our two best performing models.The classification report shows a representation of the main classification metrics on a per-class basis. This gives a deeper intuition of the classifier behavior over global accuracy which can mask functional weaknesses in one class of a multiclass problem. Visual classification reports are used to compare classification models to select models that are “redder”, e.g. have stronger classification metrics or that are more balanced.\n\nPrecision is the ability of a classiifer not to label an instance positive that is actually negative. For each class it is defined as as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true and false positives. \n\nRecall is the ability of a classifier to find all positive instances. For each class it is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.\n\nThe F1 score is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall such that the best score is 1.0 and the worst is 0.0.\n\nBased on the weighted F-1 score from the below two reports, XgBoost is a better classifier.

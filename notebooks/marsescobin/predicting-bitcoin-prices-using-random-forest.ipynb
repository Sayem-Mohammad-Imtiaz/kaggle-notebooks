{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our goal in this notebook is not to predict, as accurately as possible, the price of bitcoin tomorrow. Instead we want to see how we can use a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest to create a model that can predict bitcoin prices using historical data on bitcoin supply and demand.\n\n\n### How Random Forest Works\n\nRandom Forest will make use of decision trees to understand how these factors affected bitcoin prices in the past. Simply put, a decision tree is a flowchart-like mapping of inputs and outputs.\n\n![](https://46gyn61z4i0t1u1pnq2bbk2e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/what-is-a-decision-tree.png)\n\nThe patterns from these decision trees are what would dictate our price prediction model. The more data we can feed the Random Forest algorithm, the more opportunities it would have in finding new patterns and verifying existing patterns. It will then average the predictions of each tree to create a more reliable prediction. We will test how the predicted values fare out against the actual values. This means, we will save some data points from our dataset to test the predictions of the Random Forest algorithm.\n\nBefore we do that, let’s first see what’s in our dataset.\n\n### Quick Data Exploration\n\nOur dataset has 2,920 rows.

I created this notebook to look at how playing indoors affects the total points scored in a NFL game while also giving a tutorial on basic Python functions. \n\nThere has been a theory that has been around the NFL for a long time that playing indoors leads to higher-scoring games. There have been a number of potential reasons that have been thrown around to support this, but ultimately, this theory has mostly just been considered a myth. In this notebook, we will explore the numbers and see if there is any real correlation or at least any pattern in indoor games.\n\nStart by running the first cell below:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#  Starting Up\nFor this analysis, load in the spreadspoke_scores.csv dataset.

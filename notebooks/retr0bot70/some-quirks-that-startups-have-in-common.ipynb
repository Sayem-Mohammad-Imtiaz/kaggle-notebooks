The startup culture in general is getting to a point where all they focus on is raising the next round of funding instead of servings its customers properly, mainly because the investors want them to keep spending their investments by getting multiple offices and huge team. I think its because even if the startup fails it would acquied by some other company since it has a lot of assets,therefore the investors win anyway.

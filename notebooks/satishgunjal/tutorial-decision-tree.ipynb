Unlike other supervised learning algorithms decision tree can be used to solve regression and classification problems. The goal of decision tree is to create training model that can predict class(single or multi) or value by learning simple decision rules from training data.\nDecision tree form a flow chart like structure that's why they are very easy to interpret and understand. It is one of the few ML algorithm where its very easy to visualize and analyze the internal working of algorithm.\n\nJust like flowchart, decision tree contains different types of nodes and branches. Every decision node represent the test on feature and based on the test result it will either form another branch or the leaf node. Every branch represents the decision rule and leaf node represent the final outcome.\n\n![decision tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/Decision_Tree.png)\n\nTypes of decision tree\n* Classification decision trees − In this kind of decision trees, the decision variable is categorical. \n* Regression decision trees − In this kind of decision trees, the decision variable is continuous"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Inner Workings Of Decision Tree\n* At the root node decision tree selects feature to split the data in two major categories.\n* So at the end of root node we have two decision rules and two sub trees\n* Data will again be divided in two categories in each sub tree\n* This process will continue until every training example is grouped together.\n* So at the end of decision tree we end up with leaf node. Which represent the class or a continuous value that we are trying predict\n\n## Criteria To Split The Data\nThe objective of decision tree is to split the data in such a way that at the end we have different groups of data which has more similarity and less randomness/impurity. In order to achieve this, every split in decision tree must reduce the randomness.\nDecision tree uses 'entropy' or 'gini' selection criteria to split the data.\nNote: We are going to use sklearn library to test classification and regression. 'entropy' or 'gini' are selection criteria for classifier whereas “mse”, “friedman_mse” and “mae” are selection criteria for regressor.\n\n### Entropy\nIn order to find the best feature which will reduce the randomness after a split, we can compare the randomness before and after the split for every feature. In the end we choose the feature which will provide the highest reduction in randomness. Formally randomness in data is known as 'Entropy' and difference between the 'Entropy' before and after split is known as 'Information Gain'. Since in case of decision tree we may have multiple branches, information gain formula can be written as,\n\n```\n    Information Gain= Entropy(Parent Decision Node)–(Average Entropy(Child Nodes))\n```\n\n'i' in below Entropy formula represent the target classes \n\n   ![entropy_formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/entropy_formula.png)\n\nSo in case of 'Entropy', decision tree will split the data using the feature that provides the highest information gain.\n\n### Gini\nIn case of gini impurity, we pick a random data point in our dataset. Then randomly classify it according to the class distribution in the dataset. So it becomes very important to know the accuracy of this random classification. Gini impurity gives us the probability of incorrect classification. We’ll determine the quality of the split by weighting the impurity of each branch by how many elements it has. Resulting value is called as 'Gini Gain' or 'Gini Index'. This is what’s used to pick the best split in a decision tree. Higher the Gini Gain, better the split\n\n'i' in below Gini formula represent the target classes \n\n   ![gini_formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/satishgunjal/images/master/gini_formula.png)\n\nSo in case of 'gini', decision tree will split the data using the feature that provides the highest gini gain.\n\n### So Which Should We Use?\nGini impurity is computationally faster as it doesn’t require calculating logarithmic functions, though in reality neither metric results in a more accurate tree than the other."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Advantages Of Decision Tree\n* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized.\n* Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalization, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n* Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.\n* Able to handle multi-output problems.\n* Uses a white box model. Results are easy to interpret.\n* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Disadvantages Of Decision Tree\n* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n* Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n* Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Classification Problem Example\nFor classification exercise we are going to use sklearns iris plant dataset.\nObjective is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor or virginica) from measurements of length and width of sepals and petals\n\n## Understanding the IRIS dataset\n* iris.DESCR > Complete description of dataset\n* iris.data > Data to learn.

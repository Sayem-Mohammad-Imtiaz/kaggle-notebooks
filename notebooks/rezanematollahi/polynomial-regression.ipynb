But, in polynomial regression, we have a polynomial equation of degree n represented as:\npolynomial regression equation\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pr3.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\nHere:\n\n*          ùúÉ0 is the bias,\n*         ùúÉ1, ùúÉ2, ‚Ä¶, ùúÉn are the weights in the equation of the polynomial regression,\n*         and n is the degree of the polynomial\n\nThe number of higher-order terms increases with the increasing value of n, and hence the equation becomes more complicated.\n\n## But what if we have more than one predictor?\n\nFor 2 predictors, the equation of the polynomial regression becomes:\n\ntwo degree polynomial regression\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pr10.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nwhere,\n\n* Y is the target,\n\n* x1, x2 are the predictors,\n\n* ùúÉ0 is the bias,\n\n* and, ùúÉ1, ùúÉ2, ùúÉ3, ùúÉ4, and ùúÉ5 are the weights in the regression equation\n\nFor n predictors, the equation includes all the possible combinations of different order polynomials. This is known as Multi-dimensional Polynomial Regression.\n\nfor more information you can checkout these websites:\n\n[Introduction to Polynomial Regression (with Python

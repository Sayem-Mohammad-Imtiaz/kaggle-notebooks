Introduction\nOver the years, listening to music has developed with tremendous success and today one of the most popular music services is the streaming service Spotify, with nearly 300 million users worldwide. The service contains a database of 60 million tracks of all genres.Those songs that achieve great success among the audience remain in memory for a long time. Their influence on people can be so great that they leave their contribution to history. Songs can sometimes show us the development of entire generations.So, main goal of the project is to research and see power of the music."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

The data contains about 15 columns each describing the track and it's qualities.Chosen tracks were released in period from 1956 to 2019 and there were included songs from some notable and famous artists like Queen, The Beatles, Guns N' Roses, etc.\nThis data is extracted from the Spotify playlist - Top 2000s on PlaylistMachinery(@plamere) using Selenium with Python. More specifically, it was scraped from http://sortyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/ This data contains audio features like Danceability, BPM, Liveness, Valence(Positivity) and many more.\nEach feature's description has been given in detail below.\n* Index is ID.\n* Title- name of the track.\n* Artist- name of the artist.\n* Top Genre is the genre of track.\n* Year is the year that track was released.\n* Beats per Minute(BPM) - The tempo of the song.\n* Energy: The energy of a song - the higher the value, the more energtic song is.\n* Danceability - The higher the value, the easier to dance to this song.\n* Loudness - The higher the value, the louder the song is.\n* Liveness - The higher the value , the more lively song hears to listener.\n* Valence - The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song is.\n* Length - duration of the song.\n* Acoustic - The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.\n* Speechiness- The higher the value the more spoken words the song contains.\n* Popularity - The higher the value the more popular the song is.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  3.Formulation of research questions\n#### For detailed and deep analysis, we need to answer to the following questions:\n1.

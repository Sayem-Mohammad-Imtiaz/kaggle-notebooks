Players fight each other in one-vs-one matches defined at random.\n\nPlayers fight each other by placing a set number of units on a board as they wish. These units, or pieces, fight each other automatically when a round starts. The player who defeats their opponent’s whole squad is declared the winner of a round, and when the round is over, all units on both sides are reset to their previous position to get ready for the next round.\n\nWhen you lose a round, you lose points represented by the health of your tactician, not your units. The more opposing pieces alive after a round ends, the greater the damage you’ll take. Players who reach zero health points are knocked out of the match regardless of which round they’re in. The last player with their tactician standing is declared the winner of an autobattler match.\n\nTFT (Teamfight Tactics) is an autobattler based on the characters from League of Legends. Each character can be equip with items to increase its strength. Moreover, each character has an \"Origin\" and belongs to one or two \"Classes\". Origin and Class bonuses occur when enough characters of a given Origin or Class are in play; these bonuses further increase character strength.

Items are gained by picking them up in certain rounds, while stars are gained by getting a certain number of a character (\"star 2\" requires three of the same \"star 1\" champions. \"star 3\" requires three of the same \"star 2\" champions. ). In our case, we were only concerned with the champions. The items are encoded as numbers and nowhere in the dataset do they describe what number corresponds to each item, so, even if we did run a market basket analysis on this, we be able to say what it means. Stars, on the other hand, are just more of the same champion and, in 99.9999999% of the cases, you will just want the highest star (so 9 of the same \"star 1\" characters).

Although the Jhin and Shaco pairing is by no means the strongest pairing, there are some strong enough comps to come out of this pairing for Challenger players to make use of it, but this doesn't explain why there are some Challenger comps that can win with it but no Platinum comps that can. We think that this is because there's one very important aspect of the game that we didn't mention before: the champion pool is shared between all players.  This means that if all 8 players are looking for a certain champion, as more and more people grab it, there's a smaller and smaller chance of finding it. At the platinum level, it's still okay to go for the strongest compositions, but, at the highest level, players will always stop you from getting the most optimal comp. Because of this, Challenger players are very adaptable and can make a weaker composition viable, given the circumstances. Let's see this even more with a very strong pairing: Jinx and Graves. Both of these champions are part of a trait called Blasters, a strong trait that a lot of viable compositions are built from.

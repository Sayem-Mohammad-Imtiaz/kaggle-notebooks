A Decision Tree determines the predictive value based on series of questions and conditions. For instance, this simple Decision Tree determining on whether an individual should play outside or not. The tree takes several weather factors into account, and given each factor either makes a decision or asks another question.However, if it is raining, we must ask if it is windy or not? If windy, we will not play. But given no wind, tie those shoelaces tight because were going outside to play.</p>\n\n<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*ML5ABmp7pxnZuhIokXlPCw.png'>\n<br>\n<p> When making Decision Trees, there are several factors we must take into consideration: On what features do we make our decisions on? What is the threshold for classifying each question into a yes or no answer? In the first Decision Tree, what if we wanted to ask ourselves if we had friends to play with or not. If we have friends, we will play every time. If not, we might continue to ask ourselves questions about the weather. By adding an additional question, we hope to greater define the Yes and No classes.</p>\n\n<h1> Why Ensemble Learning?</h1>\n\n<p>This is where Ensemble Methods come in handy! Rather than just relying on one Decision Tree and hoping we made the right decision at each split, Ensemble Methods allow us to take a sample of Decision Trees into account, calculate which features to use or questions to ask at each split, and make a final predictor based on the aggregated results of the sampled Decision Trees.</p>\n\n<h1> Types of Ensemble Learning</h1>\nThere are many ensemble techniques available but we will discuss about the below two most widely used methods:\n<ul>\n    <li> Bagging </li>\n    <li> Boosting</li>\n</ul>\n<p> To read more about their difference please read this awesome article <a herf=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-ensemble-methods-in-machine-learning-4ddaf73879db\"> Here</a></p>\n "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Now Enough with the theory..

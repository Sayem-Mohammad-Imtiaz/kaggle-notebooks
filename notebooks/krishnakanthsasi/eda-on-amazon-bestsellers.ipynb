What is proportion of non fiction and fiction in the mix? Do they vary on an yearly basis? Which genre shows the most number of bestsellers over the years?\n2. How is that lowest count in reviews column is 37?\n3. Are there books or authors that seem to be repeating in their best seller status over these years?\n4. What is the average price among the bestsellers over the years? Same query applies for average rating, and average number of reviews. Is there any trend seen?\n5. Is there a correlation between the user rating and the price of the books?\n6. Similarly is there a correlation between reviews and price columns? I am holding an assumption here that more reviews signify wider readership, ergo popularity. \n7. Finally, How do wordclouds generated from the book titles and author names look like? Are some words more prominent than others?\n    "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# generating a cloud map of authors name\n#mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize']=(8.0,6.0)    #(6.0,4.0)\nmpl.rcParams['font.size']=12                #10 \nmpl.rcParams['savefig.dpi']=100             #72 \nmpl.rcParams['figure.subplot.bottom']=.1 \n\n\nstopwords = set(STOPWORDS)\n\nwordcloud = WordCloud(background_color='white',\n                          stopwords={},\n                          max_words=200,\n                          max_font_size=40, \n                          random_state=42\n                         ).generate(str(df['Author']))\n\n#print(wordcloud)\nfig = plt.figure(1)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\nfig.savefig(\"bookauthors.png\", dpi=900)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# generating a cloud map of book titles\nwordcloud_2 = WordCloud(background_color='white',\n                          stopwords=stopwords,\n                          max_words=200,\n                          max_font_size=40, \n                          random_state=42\n                         ).generate(str(df['Name']))\n\n#print(wordcloud)\nfig = plt.figure(2)\nplt.imshow(wordcloud_2)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\nfig.savefig(\"booktitles.png\", dpi=900)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Even though the wordclouds script is running well, they do not add much information, apart from magnification of words such as Doubting,Badass, and Stop.

Unsupervised learning means that there is no outcome to be predicted, and the algorithm just tries to find patterns in the data. \n- In k means clustering, we have the specify the number of clusters we want the data to be grouped into. \n- The algorithm randomly assigns each observation to a cluster, and finds the centroid of each cluster. Then, the algorithm iterates through two steps:\n    1. Reassign data points to the cluster whose centroid is closest. \n    2. Calculate new centroid of each cluster. \n\n\n- These two steps are repeated till the within cluster variation cannot be reduced any further. \n- The within cluster variation is calculated as the sum of the euclidean distance between the data points and their respective cluster centroids.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us Randomly assume that the number of clusters or groups in with the customers can be divided are 2.\n\nkm= KMeans(n_clusters=2)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.061708Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.062013Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.076699Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.061985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.075563Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data=pd.DataFrame({'x1':df['Annual Income'],'x2':df['Gender'],'y': y})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.078518Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.078987Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.092258Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.078943Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.091057Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"km.fit(data)    # Fitting the K-Means algorithm on the dataset.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.096094Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.096487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.134191Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.096452Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.133355Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"yp=km.predict(data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.135164Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.135476Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.146837Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.135447Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.145545Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Let us plot the `Scatter Plot` to view the 2 clusters obtained.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.scatter(x,y,c=yp)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.148696Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.149194Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.302623Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.149146Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.301599Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Finding correct number of clusters:\n\n### `The Elbow Method`\n\n- The Elbow Method is one of the most popular methods to determine this optimal value of k.  \n- From the above visualization, we can see that the optimal number of clusters should be around 2\n- The below function will calculate the correct value of 'K', i.e., the number of clusters present in our dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"wcss=[]\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', \n                    max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 42)\n    kmeans.fit(data)\n    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)\n    \n# Plotting the results onto a line graph, \n# allowing us to observe 'The elbow'\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nplt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)\nplt.title('The elbow method', fontweight=\"bold\")\nplt.xlabel('Number of clusters(K)')\nplt.ylabel('within Clusters Sum of Squares(WCSS)') # Within cluster sum of squares","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.303927Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.304221Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.939591Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.304193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-10T11:18:50.938271Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Observation:\n\n- From the above graph, we can say that the best classification or clustering of data can be done into 5 groups.

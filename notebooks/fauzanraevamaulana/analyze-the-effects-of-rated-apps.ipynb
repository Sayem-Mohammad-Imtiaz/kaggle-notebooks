The majority of people who use social media apps are either employees or students.\n\n**2. Shopping, Food & Drink**\n\nThis type of app is currently popular. The reason for this is that the COVID-19 pandemic season is currently underway. It makes people want to buy everything quickly, especially groceries and beverages.\n\n**3.

It has simple gameplay and is typically played in one's spare time.\n\nAlso, productivity, finance, and dating apps consistently receive low ratings.\n\n**1. Productivity**\n\nThe main reason for this is because people believe that productivity will make them more productive. However, there will come a day when applications will be unable to influence a person's behavior. As a result, some people are prone to blaming the apps for their mistakes.\n    \n**2. Finance**\n\nThe majority of finance applications are concerned with earning money, investing in stocks, and so on. However, many people struggle with stocks and lose money. This kind of thing irritates people.\n    \n**3. Dating**\n\nSingle people have attempted to utilize these applications to find a spouse. But, in the end, these applications can't guarantee that someone will get a date.

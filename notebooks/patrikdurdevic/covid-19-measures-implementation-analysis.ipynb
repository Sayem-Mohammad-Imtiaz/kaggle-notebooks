The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then, it has spread globally. At first, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on the 30th of January 2020. Almost two months later, WHO declared it a pandemic. It has been confirmed that local transmission has occurred in most of the world.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;WHO has prescribed recommended measures in an effort to try to contain the spread of the virus. They include frequent hand washing, maintaining social distance from others, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;At the time of writing, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available to treat COVID-19. Currently, the treatment focuses on symptom treatment, supportive care, and isolation.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;Ever since the COVID-19 started it’s rapid spread, the world has ground to a halt. To help flatten the curve, governments around the world have started closing businesses, cities, and in some cases even whole regions. Furthermore, they started issuing stay at home orders which exclude only essential workers. All of this led us to an economic slowdown which no-one expected.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The goal of the project is to find out how the implementations of these strategics affected the rates of COVID-19 infection. The results of this analysis can help governments and organizations around the world by showing what impact measures have on the spread. This will help them stop the spread of the virus by balancing between harsher and lenient measures while at the same time minimizing the impact on the economy.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;Besides, the results of this research could help us be prepared for any similar events in the future. If we were to know the most efficient measures to put in place at each moment in time based on the current situation, we would be able to solve any world crisis of this type without difficulties while maintaining our normal lifestyle as much as we could."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data\n&emsp;&emsp;Multiple data sources will be used for analysis in this project. The datasets were chosen based on credibility and their target use cases.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;For the overall number of confirmed cases and deaths across the world, the analysis will be performed on The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) dataset. The ECDC collects the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, based on reports from health authorities worldwide. This comprehensive and systematic process is carried out daily. It includes information from 206 countries around the globe.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;To help analyze the impact on people’s lives, we are going to use Google’s Community Mobility Reports data. These reports provide insights into what has changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. They show us movement trends over time across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The insights on various government measures implemented in response to the pandemic are found in the ACAPS COVID-19 dataset. This gives us information for 196 different countries about what type of measure was implemented, when, by whom, and what the prescribed fines are for disobedience. The project will focus on these measures to analyze what impact they had on the rates of infection."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Methods\n&emsp;&emsp;The dataset includes relevant information for about 200 countries with various situations around the world. As to not separately analyze every one of them, the data will be grouped into different regions based on similar culture and behavior. The chosen regions are:\n* Africa\n* Americas\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* Middle East\n* Oceania<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;When analyzing the data based on the described regions, what was found that some regions were under too much influence from individual countries. Analyzing the share of the cases from these countries, it was clear that they needed to be excluded from their respective regions. These countries are China and the United States. Moreover, China is already in the process of relaxing its measures which is another reason why it is excluded from the Asia region. That leaves us with 8 regions for analysis:\n* Africa\n* Americas\n* Asia\n* China\n* Europe\n* Middle East\n* Oceania\n* United States<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The exact list of countries included In each region can be found in the dedicated text document located on the GitHub repository along with the source code.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;Also, when talking about different actions and measures countries are taking to prevent the spread of the virus, you must include Sweden whose relaxed approach to the pandemic is seen as controversial by many. That is why Sweden is another country that deserves special treatment in this research. Their implementation of different tactics could prove to be the way to go for coping with the pandemic."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Analysis\n&emsp;&emsp;The analysis was started by making the graphs for total amounts of cases and deaths in respective regions at each point in time.

The least amount of measures can be seen in the lockdown category. When looking into what regions implemented which measures, some interesting observations can be made.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;In Africa, governments are putting equal emphasis on almost all of the measures including public health measures, social distancing, movement restrictions, and governance and socio-economic measures. Lockdown being the one measure they almost did not have to use.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;What’s very important to discern is the American (United States) tendency towards public health and governance and socio-economic measures. There are far more of them compared to movement restrictions and social distancing. Perhaps, in the United States, economic situation and personal freedom play a much bigger role than anywhere else.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;Europe is emphasizing on public health measures and social distancing without being afraid of implementing some movement restriction measures. The smaller number of these measures can be attributed to one of the European Union’s fundamental principles which is the free movement of people.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;On the contrary, Middle Eastern countries favor movement restrictions compared to other available measures. They have implemented more movement restriction measures than any other region.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately, this data can not be taken completely for granted as for one completely thought out social distancing measure in one country can make up for numerous leaner measures in another. Having that in mind, the following part of the analysis will give us more robust information about the effectiveness of the measures.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The most talked-about measure countries are implementing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is definitely social distancing. By comparing the data from Google mobility reports, and daily percentage increases of cases in various regions, we will analyze how effective it was to limit public gatherings. This part of the analysis will be performed on individual countries since the measures are put in place at different times across the world. Let’s take a look at how placing restrictions on public gatherings impacted pandemic growth.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The first country analyzed is the United States. The United States has implemented measures that limit public gatherings on two occasions, March 11th, and March 24th respectively. The US was chosen as the first country to be analyzed due to the plethora of accurate Google mobility data. The following graphs show us exactly how people responded when the government put in the above-mentioned measures.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://github.com/PatrikDurdevic/How-is-the-implementation-of-existing-strategies-affecting-the-rates-of-COVID-19-infection/raw/master/ipynb%20data/fig4.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"&emsp;&emsp;What can be seen is that immediately after the first measure was implemented, the numbers for retail, recreation, transit, and workplaces fell by up to about 40%.

People started going to work and retail stores less and less, while at the same time they started spending more time at home following the government’s instructions. It is understandable that there was not much of a change for groceries since people still need to go buy essentials for survival. The only unfortunate piece of information that can be found here is that people continued to spend the same amount of time in parks as they have before.<br>\n&emsp;&emsp;The following graph will display how the rates of COVID-19 infections changed upon the implementation of said measures."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://github.com/PatrikDurdevic/How-is-the-implementation-of-existing-strategies-affecting-the-rates-of-COVID-19-infection/raw/master/ipynb%20data/fig5.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"&emsp;&emsp;Immediately after the implementation of measures, not much has changed.

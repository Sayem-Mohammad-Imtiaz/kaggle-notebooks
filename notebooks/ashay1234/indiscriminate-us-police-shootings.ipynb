analysis in the notebook is done by graphically representing the analysis through comparisons between  various datasets\n* We have done a very granular level of data analysis to uncover the root cause of the shootings in various states and cities.\n* The most important point that we uncovered was that the killings in the US were not the racism based crimes that they were hyped to be.\n\nNote : My team member ( Feroz Ahmed Shaikh) and me with our mentor + friend Rocky Jagtiani (https://www.linkedin.com/in/rocky-jagtiani-3b390649/) have created many such notebooks as part of the coursework under \"Masters in Data Science Program\" at Suven (https://datascience.suvenconsultants.com) & have done internships too.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This

threat level of the intended victims. It is also indicative of the fact that there is no correlation between the race of the intended victims and the attacks on them. \n\nI would also like to conclude the fact that from the above data it is very clear that these were not unjustified as most of the cops were provoked beyond their control. Also, since it was not a racism based crime it proves the fact that the media hype was completely unjustified and it should be looked at through completely different angles for a better root cause analysis.\n\n\nVote of thanks\n--\nI would like to humbly and sincerely thank my mentor Rocky Jagtiani((https://www.linkedin.com/in/rocky-jagtiani-3b390649).

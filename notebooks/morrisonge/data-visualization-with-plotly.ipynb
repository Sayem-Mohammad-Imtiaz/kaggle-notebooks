We will focus on the **plotly** library for all of the visualizations. This library makes some of the most aesthetic plots, while providing a wide variety of options.

These include HP(Health), Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk(Special Attack), Sp. Def(Special Defense), and Speed. Other information includes the primary type and secondary type. These types include fire, water, psychic, dark, dragon, and many more. The generation is also included, which are numbers from 1 to 6. This tells us which generation or set of games that the pokemon are from. Lastly, there is a boolean variable that tells us whether a pokemon is legendary or not.\n\n### Reading the data\n\nWe use `read_csv` from the **pandas** library to read the data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pokemon = pd.read_csv('../input/pokemon/Pokemon.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Summaries and Types\n\nWe can check the data types of each variable in the data frame with `dtype` from **numpy**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pokemon.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With `.describe()` from **numpy**, we can get summary statistics of each numeric variable.

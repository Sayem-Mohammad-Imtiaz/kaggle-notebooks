Conclusion\nThis is my simple EDA on this dataset. Through this dataset, we are able to analyse the distribution of sales by Publisher and by Genre, and determine which were the big players from 1980 through to 2016, and from 2010 to 2016. It also let us have a glimpse on which Publishers were more popular in which Genre, which can provide for some insights if we were to perform an competitor analysis for the gaming industry. We can compare the top players for a particular Genre to determine the Publisher's direct competition. As an example, Nintendo may not be a direct competitor with Activision, since the type of games they create likely attracts different market segments. We would thus be more interested in companies that release Shooter game to make our analysis more relevant.\n\nAll in all, I believe there may be some other improvements which can be done to make this analysis more meaningful, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback, whether for the coding or for the analysis! :)\n\nFinally, if you like my analysis, please leave an upvote :) Greatly appreciated for a beginner like me","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

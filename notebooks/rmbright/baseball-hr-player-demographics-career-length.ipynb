An increasing number of players are from Latin America.\n\nIn the past 50 years, the vast majority of players have played for multiple seasons. This is a great improvement over the earlier years of baseball, when in many years, more than 50% of retirees had played for a single season.\n\nThe distribution of players' ages has remained steady over the past 150 years, but the average age of retirees has been increasing due to the fact that more players are remaining past their first and second year. Most players retire within 10 years, but a small minority has a career of more than 15 years.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Work","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Questions for further analysis:\n* What are the characteristics of players who have careers of at least 10 years in MLB?\n* What are the characteristics of players who leave after 1 or 2 years?","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Further work on this analysis:\n* Mapping player birthplaces through the decades\n* In what cities/states are American players born?

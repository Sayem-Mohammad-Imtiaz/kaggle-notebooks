We have a quite interesting dataset in here. It has nice features that I want to explore. These features are:\n\n1.     Ranking of the overal sales.\n1.     Name of the game.\n1.     Platform of the game got released.\n1.     Release year of the game.\n1.     Genre of the game.\n1.     Publisher of the game.\n1.     Total sales for North America, Europe, Japan and Global.\n\nHere are some questions that I think I can get answers to:\n\n1.     Which genre is the most popular over the globe?\n1.     Does culture have effect on game genre tendencies?\n1.     How is technological evolution effecting game sales?\n1.     Which company outranks others?\n1.     Do companies have tendencies about making same genre games?\n1.     Which gaming platform is the most popular?\n1.

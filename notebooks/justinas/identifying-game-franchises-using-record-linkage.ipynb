Introduction <a id=\"1\"></a>\n\nThe [Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales) dataset provides an interesting way to assess most popular games through the lense of the total amount of sales made. But what if we wanted to look at collections of similar games, i.e., game franchises, rather than individual games? There is no unique ID to identify a franchise and since the games in the same franchise will have slightly different names (e.g. Pokémon Red, Pokémon Gold, Pokémon Crystal, etc.) you cannot simply use the groupby method on them.\n\nThis notebook explores how the [Python Record Linkage Toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/recordlinkage/) can help us in this task by grouping similar name games together to idetify potential franchises.\n\n<a><img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566577134648-41d15b958d80?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80\"></a> <p style=\"text-align:center\">*In 2020, the Final Fantasy game franchise consists of 15 titles*</p>\n\n\n### **Table of Contents**\n* [Introduction](#1)\n* [Setup](#2)\n* [Data Exploration](#3)\n* [Indexing](#4)\n* [Pair Comparison](#5)\n* [Testing the Results](#6)\n* [Final Considerations](#7)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup <a id=\"2\"></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install the Record Linkage library (it is not part of the standard Kaggle notebook environment)\n%pip install recordlinkage\n\n# Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport plotly.express as px\n\nimport recordlinkage as rl\n\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Set notebook properties\npd.options.display.float_format = \"{:.2f}\".format\npd.options.display.max_rows = 100\n\n# Import the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/videogamesales/vgsales.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make all column names lower for ease of typing\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.lower()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspect the dataset holistically \ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are missing values in the `year` and `publisher` variables.

Since we have 11,493 titles in the dataset, we would have to create 66,038,776 comparison pairs (11,493 x 11,492 / 2). Even if one pair takes only 1 second to compare, it would take approximately the amount of time it took to develop Dark Souls (around 2 years) to compute.\n\nOne way to reduce this complexity is to limit the number of comparable pairs by assuming that most related games will have similar names. This naturally makes sense, as once a studio has a well selling game, it will maintain a similar name for all the subsequent releases to make the franchise more recognisable and thus potentially increasing the number of sales while reducing marketing costs.\n\nThe approach that the Record Linkage library utilises for limiting the number of pairs is called Sorted Neighbourhood Indexing. It is a fairly simple method that follows these steps:\n\n1. Sorts the entire dataset in alphabetic order.\n2. Divides  the dataset into small windows of words.\n3. Creates pairs of words within each window that can be assessed.

The one that works well with short strings like names is called [Jaro-Winkler](https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2019/09/11/what-is-jaro-jaro-winkler-similarity/). It assigns a numeric similarity score between 0 and 1 for any two strings based on:\n* The number of matching characters\n* Number of transpositions\n* If the differences occur at the beginning or the end of the string\n\nIn addition, the library allows to compare additional variables.

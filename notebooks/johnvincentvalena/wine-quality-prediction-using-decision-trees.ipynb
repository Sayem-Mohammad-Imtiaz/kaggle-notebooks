The Wine Quality dataset consists of red wine samples. The inputs include objective tests (e.g. pH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).\n\nThe dataset input variables (based on physicochemical tests) are:\n\n1. fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)\n2. volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)\n3. citric acid (g / dm^3)\n4. residual sugar (g / dm^3)\n5. chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3\n6. free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)\n7. total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)\n8. density (g / cm^3)\n9. pH\n10. sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm^3)\n11. alcohol (% by volume)\n\n\nThe output variable (based on sensory data) is:\n\n12. quality (score between 0 and 10)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install pydotplus","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\nimport seaborn as sb\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nfrom six import StringIO  \nfrom IPython.display import Image  \nimport pydotplus\n\nplt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Wine Quality Dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"wine_df = pd.read_csv('../input/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/winequality-red.csv')\nwine_df.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Summary Statistics"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"wine_df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Check for missing values"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(wine_df.isna().sum())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We check for any missing values across all rows to see if there are any records that need to be removed or filled in.

For example, wines with a quality score of 7 or more would be classified as good quality wine and wines with a quality score of less than 7 would be classified as bad quality wine. However, this approach is problematic as it does not differentiate a wine with a quality score of 3 and a wine with a quality score of 6, when in reality there is an actual difference to someone who tastes them.\n\nFraming it as a regression problem would mean the predictions made by the model are floating point numbers and not discrete values.\n\nHence, the approach taken in this project is to frame it as a regression problem but round up or round down the predictions made by the model in order to obtain discrete values. Then, the predictions are compared against the test set to obtain the accuracy of the predictions."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Train/Test Split"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The wine quality data is split into 70% for the training set and 30% for the test set."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = wine_df.drop('quality', axis=1).values\nX = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)\ny = np.ravel(wine_df[['quality']])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=200)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fitting the Decision Tree"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Decision Tree Regressor"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=200)\nreg = reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = reg.predict(X_test)\ny_pred = np.array([round(y) for y in y_pred])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Evaluating the Model\nprint('Accuracy:', sum(y_test == y_pred) / len(y_test == y_pred))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dot_data = StringIO()\nexport_graphviz(reg, out_file=dot_data,  \n                filled=True, rounded=True,\n                special_characters=True,\n                feature_names = wine_df.drop('quality', axis=1).columns)\ngraph = pydotplus.graph_from_dot_data(dot_data.getvalue())  \ngraph.write_png('wine_quality.png')\nImage(graph.create_png())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Bagging"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bag_reg = BaggingRegressor(random_state=200)\nbag_reg = bag_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_bag = bag_reg.predict(X_test)\ny_pred_bag = np.array([round(y) for y in y_pred_bag])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Evaluating the Model\nprint('Accuracy:', sum(y_test == y_pred_bag) / len(y_test == y_pred_bag))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Boosting"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"boost_reg = GradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=200)\nboost_reg = boost_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_boost = boost_reg.predict(X_test)\ny_pred_boost = np.array([round(y) for y in y_pred_boost])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Evaluating the Model\nprint('Accuracy:', sum(y_test == y_pred_boost) / len(y_test == y_pred_boost))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Random Forest"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=200)\nrf_reg = rf_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred_rf = rf_reg.predict(X_test)\ny_pred_rf = np.array([round(y) for y in y_pred_rf])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Evaluating the Model\nprint('Accuracy:', sum(y_test == y_pred_rf) / len(y_test == y_pred_rf))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evaluation of Results"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"|               | Accuracy          |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Decision Tree | 62.71%            |\n| Bagging       | 64.79%            |\n| Boosting      | 66.04%            |\n| Random Forest | 71.25%            |"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the results above, at the baseline with no tuning of parameters, we can see that Random Forest gives the highest accuracy and therefore the Random Forest model will be used and its parameters will be tuned."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Importances"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"keys = wine_df.columns\nvalues = rf_reg.feature_importances_\nvar_imp = dict(zip(keys, values))\nvar_imp = dict(sorted(var_imp.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))\n\nrcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = [10, 8]\nplt.title('Feature Importances', fontsize=20)\nplt.barh(list(var_imp.keys()), list(var_imp.values()))\nplt.xlabel('Relative Importance', fontsize=20)\nplt.xticks(fontsize=15)\nplt.yticks(fontsize=15)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the Feature Importances plot shown above, it can be seen that no single feature has a relative importance that is too insignificant to discount.

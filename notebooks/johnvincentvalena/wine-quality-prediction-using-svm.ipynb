Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).\n\nThe dataset input variables (based on physicochemical tests) are:\n\n1. fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)\n2. volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)\n3. citric acid (g / dm^3)\n4. residual sugar (g / dm^3)\n5. chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3\n6. free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)\n7. total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)\n8. density (g / cm^3)\n9. pH\n10. sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm^3)\n11. alcohol (% by volume)\n\n\nThe output variable (based on sensory data) is:\n\n12. quality (score between 0 and 10)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sb\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions\n\nplt.style.use('default')\nrcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = [10, 8]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Loading Wine Quality Dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"wine_df = pd.read_csv('../input/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/winequality-red.csv')\nwine_df.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Summary Statistics"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"wine_df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Check for missing values"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(wine_df.isna().sum())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since there are no missing values, we can proceed with the data as is."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Correlation Heatmap"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A heatmap of the pairwise correlation coefficients are plotted to observe the collinearity of the variables.

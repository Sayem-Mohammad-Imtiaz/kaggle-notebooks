As we can see languages associated with web development are most frequently used as well as SQL which is the only database query language that shows up in these rankings. The most used languages JavaScript, HTML and CSS are kind of mandatory in the web context. Even if you don't type HTML in your editor, you have to at least generate it, if you want to create a web page.\n\nI think the middle graph is the most revealing about the reputation of languages. Python and Go seem to have the best reputation in the Stack Overflow community. They are followed by Kotlin and TypeScript whose main purpose seems to be avoiding to write code in Java and JavaScript respectively. On the lower end we see languages that either have a bad reputation or are not in vogue any more, for example CoffeeScript would probably have shown up closer to the top just a few years ago.\n\nThe graph on the right says something about how satisfying it is to work with a particular language. From my own experience I can definitely confirm that Python provides a much more joyful experience than several of the other languages that appear further towards the bottom.\n\nLet's look at platforms next."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b603778aec3a5a7efe0c932513f9ebe144c56265","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_ranking(df_tech, 'platform')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fececafd5a6d1ef8af99b522c812e78cfcb8bf21"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Belonging to the minority of Linux desktop users I'm happy to see that it is at least widely used in a development context and mostly liked by the people who work with it.

Looking at the 3rd graph working with frameworks generally seems to be less desirable compared to the other types of technologies.

It shows plots for languages, databases, platforms and frameworks that show which technologies are most widely used, which ones developers are most interested in and which are most satisfying to work with.\n\n## Source\n\nThis notebook was originally published at: http://ramiro.org/notebook/sos2018-technology-preferences/"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

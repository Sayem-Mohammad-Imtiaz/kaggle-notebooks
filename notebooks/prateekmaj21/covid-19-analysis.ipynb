The outbreak has caused numerous challenges and problems, with governments and organisations facing new problems. Global situation is alarming. Companies are facing losses.\n\nAI, Data Science and Technology is helping to fight the Virus outbreak. Chinese authorities initiated their response to the virus, taking help from technology giants like Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei. Country’s healthcare initiatives were boosted and data about the outbreak was analysed and adequate measures were taken.\n\nTo know about how to prevent the spread of virus, authorities need to know where the people are. Facebook has already teamed up with researchers at Harvard University’s School of Public Health and the National Tsing Hua University, in Taiwan, sharing data about people’s movements and high-resolution population density maps, which help them forecast the spread of the virus.

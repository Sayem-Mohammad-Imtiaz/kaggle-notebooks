Brief Conclusion of the EDA"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In short, this dataset clearly showed how competetive the Google Play Store is. More than half of the apps had close to 0 ratings and installs. \n\nEven though there were more than 50 categories, only top 8 were explored which accounted to more than half of all apps. Among the top 8, `Tools` category was a clear winner in terms of install and rating count. \n\nMajority of the paid apps cost around a dollar however there were outliers as huge as 400 dollars. \nComing to paid apps, most expensive categories were Food & Drink and Business. \n\nIn 4th and 5th parts of the exploration, the dataset was looked at from different angles. Specifically, the relationships between rating and rating count, rating and install count, rating and maintenance were explored. \n\nFor better insight, apps with no ratings and installs were exlcuded. This showed that most apps had a rating of ~4.5 and most highly-rated apps were in Music."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

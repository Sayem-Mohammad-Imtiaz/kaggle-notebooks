There are 4 quality levels - low (`l`), medium (`m`), high (`h`) and 4k (`k`) with increasing render time. \n\nIf you want a GIF version of the animation, just add `-i` after `-pqh`. Here is a [full list](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/configuration.html) of manim CLI commands.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Breaking down the basic Manim API","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's understand the above animation by analyzing the code line by line. \n\nAfter importing all manim content in the first line, we are defining a scene class with a construct method:\n\n```python\nclass MyFirstAnimation(Scene):\n    def construct(self):\n        ...\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is the general formula of creating a single animation - you define a custom class that inherits from the [`Scene`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.scene.scene.Scene.html) class and has a `construct` method. `Scene` class is the higher-level building block of Manim which connects all related animations and objects into a single structure.\n\nNext, we are creating two objects (a star and a circle) that belong to a `Mobject` class (mathematical object). This [`Mobject`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference_index/mobjects.html) class is a base data structure for many built-in mobjects like geometric shapes, vectors, coordinate systems, etc. Basically, everything that is not a scene and animation is a `Mobject`.\n\n```python\nclass MyFirstAnimation(Scene):\n    def construct(self):\n        # Create basic mobjects\n        star = Star(n=5, fill_color=RED, stroke_color=BLUE)\n        circle = Circle(fill_color=DARK_BLUE, fill_opacity=.8, stroke_color=BLUE)\n```\n\nThen, we have the [`Animation`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference_index/animations.html) classes. In the above example, we are using 3 of them - `FadeIn`, `Transform` and `FadeOut`. All built-in `Animation` classes in manim accept mobjects as arguments and apply various effects to them. For example, `Transform` accepts two mobjects and plays out a smooth animation that converts the first one to the other.\n\n```python\nself.play(FadeIn(star, run_time=2))\n# Wait for a second\nself.wait()\n# Transform star into a circle\nself.play(Transform(star, circle))\nself.wait(0.5)\n# Remove the circle by fading it out\nself.play(FadeOut(circle))\n```\n\nEvery time you create an animation, you have to wrap it inside the `play` function so that they are rendered on the screen.\n\nLastly, we have the constants like `RED`, `BLUE`, `YELLOW`, `PI`, `TAU`, etc. These are part of the [`constants`](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.constants.html) module of Manim and encode commonly-used values as variables and are imported in the first line of the snippet:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from manim import *\n\nYELLOW, RED, BLUE","metadata":{"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-17T06:00:54.186602Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-17T06:00:54.187082Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.38909Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-17T06:00:54.187027Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.388002Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"PI, TAU  # 2 * PI","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.391437Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.391851Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.400872Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.391808Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.39926Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Controlling Mobjects and their location","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By default, all mobjects added to the screen gets displayed in the `ORIGIN`:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ORIGIN","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.403156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.403514Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.41529Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.403481Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-17T06:00:55.41428Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Manim uses numpy arrays to represent the screen in `x`, `y`, `z` coordinates. `z` will stay 0 as long as you are animating in the 2D space.

Of course it can!\n\nWhat you learned today, though very cool already, is only a thin slice of what manim can do. The above animations are only what Grant Sanderson uses in his simple opening scenes. \n\nThe library has a steep learning curve when you want to move beyond the built-in mobjects and animation classes. Implementing custom classes can be pretty verbose, often taking thousands lines of code for longer videos.\n\nHowever, this shouldn't stop you if you truly love math and explaining it to others in novel and creative ways.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Parting words","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I apologize for turning this piece into too much of a \"how-to\" post.

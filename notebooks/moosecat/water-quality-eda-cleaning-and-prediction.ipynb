It indicates how acidic or alkaline (basic) that substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14\n\nThe WHO guidelines for Drinking water is between 6.5 and 8.5\nOutside these limits many halmful metals may become soluble.\n\n## Hardness\nHardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water.\nNot of health concern at levels found in\ndrinking-water, however can remove other metals that maybe be harmful.\n\nThe taste threshold for the calcium ion is in the range of 100–300 mg/l. the taste threshold for magnesium is probably lower than that for calcium. In\nsome instances, consumers tolerate water hardness in excess of 500 mg/l\n\n## Solids\nTotal dissolved solids (TDS) comprise inorganic salts (principally calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates) and small amounts of organic matter that are dissolved in water\n\nThe palatability of water with a total dissolved solids (TDS) level of less than about 600 mg/l is generally considered to be good; drinking-water becomes significantly and increasingly unpalatable at TDS levels greater than about 1000 mg/l. \n\nDesirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l which prescribed for drinking purpose.\n\n## Chloramines\nMonochloramine, dichloramines and trichloramines are considered by-products of drinking-water chlorination. Chloramines, such as monochloramine, dichloramine and trichloramine (nitrogen trichloride), are generated from the reaction of chlorine with ammonia. Among chloramines, monochloramine is the only useful chlorine disinfectant, and chloramination systems are operated to minimize the formation of dichloramine and trichloramine. Higher chloramines, particularly trichloramine, are likely to give rise to taste and odour complaints, except at very low concentrations.\n\nFor monochloramine, no odour or taste was detected at concentrations between\n0.5 and 1.5 mg/l. For dichloramine, the organoleptic effects between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l were found to be “slight” and “acceptable”. \nMost individuals are able to taste chloramines at concentrations below 5\nmg/l, and some at levels as low as 0.3 mg/l.\n\nChlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n\n## Sulfate\nSulfates occur naturally in numerous minerals and are used commercially, principally in the chemical industry. They are discharged into water in industrial wastes and through atmospheric deposition; however, the highest levels usually occur in groundwater and are from natural sources.\nThe presence of sulfate in drinking-water can cause noticeable taste, and very high levels might cause a laxative effect in unaccustomed consumers. Taste impairment varies with the nature of the associated cation; taste thresholds have been found to range from 250 mg/l for sodium sulfate to 1000 mg/l for calcium sulfate. It is generally considered that taste impairment is minimal at levels below 250 mg/l. No health-based guideline value has been derived for sulfate.\nNot of health concern at levels found in drinking-water.\nThe ratio of the chloride and sulfate concentrations to the bicarbonate concentration (Larson ratio).\n\n## Conductivity\nPure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator. Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceeded 400 μS/cm.\n\n## Total Organic Carbon (TOC)\nHigh colour from natural organic carbon (e.g. humics) could also indicate a high propensity to produce by-products from disinfection processes. No health-based guideline value is proposed for colour in drinking-water. According to US EPA < 2 mg/L as TOC in treated / drinking water, and < 4 mg/Lit in source water which is use for treatment.\n\n## Trihalomethanes\nTHMs are formed in drinking-water primarily as a result of chlorination of organic matter present naturally in raw water supplies. The rate and degree of THM formation increase as a function of the chlorine and humic acid concentration, temperature, pH and bromide ion concentration.\nBromide can be involved in the reaction between chlorine and naturally occurring organic matter in drinking-water, forming brominated and mixed chloro-bromo by-products, such as trihalomethanes (THMs) and halogenated acetic acids (HAAs), or it can react with ozone to form bromate. Trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids are the most common DBPs and occur at among the highest concentrations in drinking-water.\nTHM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.\n\n## Turbidity\nThe turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter. \nHigh levels of turbidity can protect microorganisms from the effects of disinfection, stimulate the growth of bacteria and give rise to a\nsignificant chlorine demand.\nThe mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.\n\n## Potability\nIndicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"water_df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-14T13:49:13.931297Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-14T13:49:13.931687Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-14T13:49:13.978883Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-14T13:49:13.931652Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-14T13:49:13.977595Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data cleaning\nWe have incomplete data for pH, Sulphate & Trihalomethanes.\nIdeally we want to replace or remove the missing values.

That is indeed valuable, but has already been done quite thoroughly in other people's work.\n\nInstead I will demonstrate a method to look for less obvious relationships in the data that can cast completely new light on it.\n\n# Use a Community QLattice\nThe QLattice is a supervised machine learning tool for symbolic regression developed by [Abzu](https://www.abzu.ai) . It is inspired by Richard Feynman's path integral formulation. That's why the python module to use it is called *Feyn*, and the *Q* in QLattice is for Quantum.\n\nAbzu provides free QLattices for non-commercial use to anyone. These free community QLattices gets allocated for us automatically when we use Feyn without an active subscription, which is what we do in this notebook. Read more about how it works here: https://docs.abzu.ai/docs/guides/getting_started/community.html\n\n# Relationships in the data\nOne use of symbolic regression in data analysis is to get a sense of how the individual features relate to each other and to the target. This kind of insight can supplement more conventional data analysis by higlighing non-linear relationships and interactive relationships. In this notwbook we will mot concern ourselves with the predicting water potability, but rather with understanding the relationships between the different features.\n\n# Install the feyn module\nThe feyn Python module is not installed on Kaggle by default so we have to pip install it first. \n__Note__: the pip install will fail unless you enable *Internet* in the *settings* to the right

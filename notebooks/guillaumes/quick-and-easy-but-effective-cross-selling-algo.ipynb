Usually, the text above this recommendation on an ecommerce website is \"You may also like ...\".\n\nThis model could be improve by:\n\n* performing AB testing and measuring KPIs;\n* addind statistical association rules (if an item is very popular, it would be recommended for each item. But this is sometime not a pattern we want to see);\n* addind business rules;\n* going from a non persolized to a personalized cross-selling algorith;\n* taking into account stock availability of your warehouse;\n* not displaying already bought item of the current user visiting your website;\n* not displaying female item if you know your current user is male;\n* building geolocalized cross-selling (because you know where are located your customers);\n* ... and many more additional steps!\n\nIf you have an interest for personalization, retail or ecommerce you can check out this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/decathlondevelopers/personalization-strategy-and-recommendation-systems-at-d%C3%A9cathlon-canada-d9cb3d37f675)\n\nFeel free to comment :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 0.

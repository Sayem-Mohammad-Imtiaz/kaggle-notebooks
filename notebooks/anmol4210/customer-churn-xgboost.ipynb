In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks. However, when it comes to small-to-medium structured/tabular data, decision tree based algorithms are considered best-in-class right now. Please see the chart below for the evolution of tree-based algorithms over the years.\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*QJZ6W-Pck_W7RlIDwUIN9Q.jpeg\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\n## Why does XGBoost perform so well?\nXGBoost and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are both ensemble tree methods that apply the principle of boosting weak learners (CARTs generally) using the gradient descent architecture. However, XGBoost improves upon the base GBM framework through systems optimization and algorithmic enhancements.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*FLshv-wVDfu-i54OqvZdHg.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Customer churn with XGBoost\n\nA telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors.

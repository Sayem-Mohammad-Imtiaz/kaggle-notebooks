For the most part, the results look pretty similar to the previous results from the previous analysis. However, we now have the ability to analyse each vaccine on a country by country basis, without any augmentation from other vaccines. We can see that Oxford/AstraZenca is still the most common vaccine with use in 118, followed by Pfizer/BioNTech (92 countries) and Moderna with a huge gap in third place (36 countries). All of these vaccines were the earliest vaccines reported to be in development. \n\nLet's plot this dataframe on a bar graph.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"with sns.plotting_context('notebook', font_scale = 1.5):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))\n    plt.title('Most commonly used vaccine worldwide')\n    sns.barplot(y=most_used_vaccine.index, x=most_used_vaccine['Number of countries'])\n    plt.ylabel(' ')\n    plt.xlabel('Number of countries');","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bonus questions and analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Apart from the United Kingdom, who else uses the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a UK resident, it is the norm to hear about the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, as it was one of the first vaccines to enter clinical trials, is developed in the UK, and was regularly mentioned by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Officers, as well as cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister himself. Recently, the vaccine has come under fire from the European Union and participating countries after claims that the vaccine causes blood clots (venous thromboembolism). It was later rebutted by many independent scientists, the Chief Executive from the Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency, who later said there is no evidence to suggest that the vaccine increases chances of blood clots. Germany have since then, however, have suspending the vaccine's use in over-60s. On the 07/04/21, following the reports of blood clots in women under 60 and 13 related deaths, other European countries, such as France, Spain and Italy, have also responded in a similar way by only giving the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to a particular age group. The UK's MHRA have issued guidance on this vaccine, declaring that any 18-34 year old will be given a choice of an alternate vaccine (i.e Moderna or Pfizer).\n\nDespite this, how many countries (that aren't part of the United Kingdom, including its devolved administrations) still use the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Creating a list of strings which contain the countries of the United Kingdom, as well as the UK itself.\n\nunited_kingdom = ['United Kingdom', 'England', 'Scotland', 'Wales', 'Northern Ireland']\n\n# Excluding all values that match the aforementioned list and displaying the results\n\nuk_filter = covid_vaccine_data_f[~covid_vaccine_data_f.index.isin(united_kingdom)]\nvaccines_minus_united_kingdom = uk_filter.loc[uk_filter.vaccines == 'Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech']\nwith pd.option_context('display.width', 500, 'display.max_columns', 5, 'display.max_colwidth', 15):\n    display(vaccines_minus_united_kingdom)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Which countries are making the best recoveries (i.e. had the highest death toll, but has the highest amount of daily vaccinations)?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Filtering out the appropriate columns from the dataset, which are 'deaths' and 'total_vaccinations' respectively, \n# sorting them, and then preparing them for joining.\n\ncovid_deaths = covid_vaccine_data_f.deaths.sort_values(ascending=False).dropna().reset_index()\ncovid_deaths = covid_deaths.set_index('country')\n\ncovid_daily_vacc = covid_vaccine_data_f.daily_vaccinations.sort_values(ascending=False).dropna().reset_index()\ncovid_daily_vacc = covid_daily_vacc.set_index('country')\ncovid_best_recovery = covid_deaths.join(covid_daily_vacc)\n\n# Narrowing the dataset to the top 10 highest values, and verifying the data after the joining process.\n\ntop_10 = covid_best_recovery[0:10]\ndisplay(top_10)\n\n# Plotting the data\nwith sns.plotting_context('notebook', font_scale = 1.25):\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))\n    ax = fig.add_subplot()\n    ax2 = ax.twinx()\n\n    sns.barplot(data=top_10, x=top_10.index, y='deaths', ax=ax, label='deaths', alpha=0.5)\n    sns.barplot(data=top_10, x=top_10.index, y='daily_vaccinations', ax=ax2, label='daily_vaccinations', alpha=0.5)\n    ax.set_ylim(0, 750000)\n    plt.title('Top 10 fastest recovering countries\\n (via daily vaccinations versus death toll)')\n    plt.ylabel('Total number of daily vaccinations (in millions)');","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The chart above paints a pretty positive picture of how the vaccinations programmes are progressing around the globe, not only is every single country vaccinating more than their death tolls per day, the margins some countries have achieved between those who are vaccinated and their death tolls is substantial.

That's all thanks to the incredible effort by scientists across the globe, who have managed to engineer vaccines for public use within twelve months of identifying a novel coronavirus. New vaccines are being engineered and put up for approval all of the time, and vaccines against COVID-19 will only become more available as time goes on.\n\nThis is also my first full EDA on Kaggle, so if you liked it please show your appreciation and leave any criticisms and suggestions.

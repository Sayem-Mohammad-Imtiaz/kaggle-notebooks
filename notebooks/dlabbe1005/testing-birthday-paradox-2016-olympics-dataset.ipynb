It is strange, counter-intuitive, and completely true, but the birthday problem (birthday paradox) is a thing.\nIt's only a \"paradox\" because our brains can't handle the compounding power of exponents. We expect probabilities to be linear and only consider the scenarios we're involved in (both faulty assumptions). But the comparison is made pair-wise. And there are a lot of comparisons in samples like that.\n\nThis Kernel proves the converging probabilities, sampling random athletes with different sample sizes.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9610de5c-1eb1-4f4d-bac3-f11566b48755","_uuid":"689d2ee7c8a19db34cec25bce50736c1bca020ee"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# import packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2d0a6225-fd4d-439f-b90b-ec18408d894c","_uuid":"56f681e4693116264ab530d8cbe1755af19c0fb2","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# import and convert the birthday to date\nathletes = pd.read_csv('../input/athletes.csv')\nathletes['birthday'] = pd.to_datetime(athletes['dob'], format='%m/%d/%y', errors='ignore')\nathletes = athletes[~athletes['birthday'].isnull()]","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"171f6d44-a7cd-481f-ae5a-a5fd68f0927c","_uuid":"cd62cae0e9a77c0450c643f698094a8393c22da5","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# set the number of trials\nnum_trials = 100\n\n# define the sample sizes that will be tested and its associated probability\nsample_size = [[23,50.7], [30,70.6], [40,89.1], [50,97.0], [60,99.4]]\n\nflag_print = False\ncount = []","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fd855060-d9a4-442d-803a-d47f8219536f","_uuid":"aa583e27f609ee3e8fb69e7b92303fff4704fa89","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"# function to sample the data in the parameterized size\ndef sample(sample_size):\n    return athletes.sample(sample_size).reset_index()\n\n# compare if two birthdays are the same\ndef isSameMonthDay(date1, date2):\n    if str(date1.month) + '-' + str(date1.day) == str(date2.month) + '-' + str(date2.day):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# print the pair of matches\ndef printPair(pair):\n    text = ' - {}({}) was born in {}, and {}({}) born in {}.'\n    print(text.format(athletes[athletes.id == pair[0]].name.values[0],\n                      athletes[athletes.id == pair[0]].nationality.values[0],\n                      athletes[athletes.id == pair[0]].dob.values[0],\n                      athletes[athletes.id == pair[1]].name.values[0],\n                      athletes[athletes.id == pair[1]].nationality.values[0],\n                      athletes[athletes.id == pair[1]].dob.values[0]))\n\n# print the all pairs of matches\ndef printMatch(sample_size, match_list):\n    text = 'With sample size of {}, there are {} pairs of athletes who were born at the same day and month.

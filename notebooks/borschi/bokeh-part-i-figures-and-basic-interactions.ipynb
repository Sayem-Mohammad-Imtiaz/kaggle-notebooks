For a more detailed and in depth description you can visit Bokeh's great [user guide](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html) and excellent [gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first step is to load all libraries we are going to use in the sections following. Without data, there won't be anything to visualize and interact, so we will import the usual suspects *Numpy* and *Pandas*.\n\nEvery visualization more or less contains the same steps, which are also reflected in the bokeh modules shown here. \n1. First of all, the figure needs to be set up: \n    * from bokeh.plotting import figure\n2. The data needs to be connected and drawn to the figure: \n    * from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, HoverTool\n3. Orchestrate the way you want to layout your figure(s). This is important if you create more than one figure\n    * from bokeh.layouts import row, column, gridplot\n4. Finally import the modules needed to render your figures either to a file or like here to our notebook\n    * from bokeh.io import output_file, output_notebook\n    \nWith the libraries in place, we can start to have fun.

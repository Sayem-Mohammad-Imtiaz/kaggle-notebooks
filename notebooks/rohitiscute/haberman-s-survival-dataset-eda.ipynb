The lesser the no of lymphs found the higher is the chance of survival.\n-  90% of the patients have less than 8 and 20 axillary nodes for positive and negative result patients respectively.\n-  The mean of no of axillary nodes is 2.8 for patients who survived for atleast 5 years and 8.5 for patients who didn't survive for 5 years.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

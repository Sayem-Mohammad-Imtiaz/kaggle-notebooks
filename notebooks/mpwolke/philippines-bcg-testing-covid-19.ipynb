Daily cases set a record Tuesday of 6,277. Now cities have shut down again, threatening access to workplaces in a country where many people depend on daily labor to survive.\n\n“A lot of it is because people don’t follow the protocols,” \n\n“They don’t wear masks,” “and the biggest issue of all is that people don’t observe social distancing.”\n\nAmong hospitals, “things were so bureaucratic and top-down, and when they decided to open up the economy little by little, it turned out that much of the supposed things that should have been done during the strict lockdown period have not been done.”\n\nA lot of people still fear getting tested for COVID-19 at hospitals in case they test positive. Some parts of the country lack bed space for any local surge in cases.\n\nNot everyone wears a face mask in shopping malls, often because they find them uncomfortable or because they left them at home. In restaurants, diners sit “bunched up” at bigger tables, even if the next table is only a meter away.https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/how-philippines-got-runaway-covid-19-caseload-outlier-asia","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Healthcare workers from the Philippine Coast Guard are seen wearing wearing protection equipments inside a newly-converted COVID-19 mass testing center in Manila, the Philippines, on May 5, 2020.

(PhilHealth) amounting to millions of pesos, adding burden to an already overwhelmed and cash-drained health-care system on the ground.\n\nDelays in PhilHealth reimbursements have become a problem for the laboratories.\n\n“Some labs have scaled down their testing by accepting only the specimens of paying patients. They’ve heard complaints, too, about labs refusing to test PhilHealth cases, while others prefer not to be accredited by PhilHealth dahil ’di nababayaran (because they are not being paid).\n\nNot all COVID molecular laboratories accredited by the DOH are automatically accredited by PhilHealth.\nhttps://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1320868/testing-labs-await-philhealth-payment","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Dataset from John Wendell Balagot https://www.kaggle.com/delllectron/testing-data-covid19","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/testing-data-covid19/FHS9WUBLBY/covid-19_testing_data.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"PH = df[(df['Country']=='Philippines')].reset_index(drop=True)\nPH.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Stay Home in Low-income Countries\n\nStay-home measures resumed this week in metro Manila and other parts of the country affecting about 27 million of the country’s 109.5 million population.\n\nPublic transport has noticeably slowed, making it hard for even medical staffers to reach their jobs. Prolonged shutdowns will keep poorer people away from work too long.\n\nThis is always the problem in low-income countries where a lot of people are dependent on daily work and there’s no government support, so I think this is the problem in places like in the Philippines that you can’t really keep people locked down for long periods of time because many have very little savings, if any.\n\nRemote parts of the Philippines, a group of some 7,100 islands, still report few cases, however.

A systematic review. Authors: Marco Bo and Carla Maria Zotti  Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2016 Nov; 12(11): 2753–2764.\nPublished online 2016 Jul 7. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2016.1200776\n\nFor each policy, they reviewed the criteria used to recommend immunization, their level of evidence, the evidence supporting them and the actions required in cases of refusal. Four legal acts, 15 policies and 6 papers from 14 European countries met the inclusion criteria. Among European national agencies, 5 only recommend the immunization of HCWs employed in high-risk sectors, highlighting the lack of evidence of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) efficacy in HCWs; 5 recommend BCG vaccination for all previously unvaccinated Mantoux-negative HCWs, underlining that some studies provide arguments of some BCG efficacy in HCWs; and four do not recommend the vaccine. Different interpretations of existing evidence on BCG efficacy and the demographics of HCWs may have influenced national policies.\n\nMany national policies (e.g., the Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish ones) only reported that the efficacy of BCG is high for preventing TB deaths and severe generalized infections in children, while it is more variable in its ability to reduce the risk of infection and prevent pulmonary TB in adults.\n\nHCWs coming from high-prevalence countries have an increased risk of acquiring TB when they visit their country of origin or fellow countrymen in the community where they live in Europe. Thus, the HCWs themselves become a possible source of healthcare-associated TB infections.\n\nThis review shows that the classical distinction between high- and low-prevalence countries alone is misleading when describing national policies. Migration and the national policies for recruiting health personnel are responsible for significant differences in the risk of exposure to TB for both HCWs and patients in Europe, even in countries with apparently similar national epidemiological trends.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5137543/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#word cloud\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator\ntext = \" \".join(str(each) for each in PH.Country)\n# Create and generate a word cloud image:\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_words=200,colormap='Set2', background_color=\"black\").generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n# Display the generated image:\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='Bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.figure(1,figsize=(12, 12))\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Das War's, Kaggle Notebook Runner: Marília Prata  @mpwolke ","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

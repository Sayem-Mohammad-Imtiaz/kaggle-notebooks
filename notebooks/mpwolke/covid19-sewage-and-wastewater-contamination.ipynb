However, as viruses cannot replicate outside the host cell, their detection in environmental samples/surfaces and sewage suggests their excretion by infected humans or animals.\n\nFor host cell entry, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (enterocytes) and other internal organs, like the testes, kidneys, and heart, but has medium to low expression in the lungs (type 2 pneumocytes), liver, blood, spleen, and brain. \n\n<font color=\"#E74C3C\">ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)</font>\n\nThe higher expression of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also supported by SARS-CoV-2 shedding for a longer duration from the stool samples of patients with COVID-19.

Amid ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and emerging evidences of SARS-CoV-2 presence in the wastewater one must be hesitant to reuse the unprocessed or partially processed waterwater for irrigation.\n\nThe sensitivity of WBE may depend upon the population size of sewer catchment, proportion of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic individuals. Viral particles or RNA in sewage samples represents a collection of virus shed by many people in the community; hence it is equivalent to pooled testing.\n\nMoreover, global investigators highlighted that sewage surveillance could reveal the true scale of the COVID-19 pandemic and helps in designing crucial policy makings to contain the virus.\n\nWaterborne viruses often enter and contaminate water sources through contaminated feces, and the same has been proposed for COVID-19 .

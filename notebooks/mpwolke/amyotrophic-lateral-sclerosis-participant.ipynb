For many years following, ALS was commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.\"\n\n\"Gehrig played with the New York Yankees for 17 years and received the moniker “The Iron Horse” due to his ability to play baseball despite suffering from a variety of injuries.\" \n\n\"Born in New York City to the son of German immigrants, Heinrich and Christina Gehrig, Gehrig attended Columbia University on a football scholarship to study engineering, yet he also played the sport for which he is best known during his tenure at the Ivy League school.  A baseball scout signed Gehrig to the Yankees in 1923 due to his remarkable hitting skills.  Gehrig held various positions on the team until his retirement.  These included shortstop and outfielder; however, many know him best as the Yankees’ first baseman.\" \n\nHe was diagnosed with ALS on his 36th birthday during a visit with his wife Eleanor to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on June 19, 1939.  Prior to his diagnosis, Gehrig noticed several of the disease’s symptoms while playing on the field, which included a loss of strength, slipping and falling, and loss of coordination.\n\n\"Shortly after his diagnosis, Gehrig chose to retire from baseball.  The Yankees designated July 4, 1939 “Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day” at Yankee Stadium and honored its former first baseman for his sportsman-like behavior and dedication to the game.  On this day, nearly 62,000 fans listened to Gehrig as he gave his famous speech where he deemed himself “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”

scientists have identified biological markers present in childhood that relate to the degenerative and often fatal neurological disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, according to a study published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology in May 2020.\nThe researchers found the markers in the teeth of patients who went on to develop ALS as adults. They used lasers to map growth rings that form daily in the teeth and discovered evidence in the growth rings formed at birth and within the first 10 years of life that patients with ALS metabolized metals differently than patients without the disease.\n\nALS is a condition that usually manifests when someone is in their 50s or 60s. The cause is not known, and there is no test to predict its onset. Genetic studies have not revealed a great deal yet, and while experts believe environmental factors play a significant role in the development of the disease, there have been no clear indications of which ones.\n\nhttps://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2020/researchers-discover-biomarkers-of-als-in-teeth-pr"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSmGGz_sNlxK-4ZumVC46EnQgxHAPON15k8tw&usqp=CAU)alsnewstoday.com"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#eb6134; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%\">Teeth of ALS Patients Show Odd Metabolism of Metals in Childhood</h1>\n\nAuthor: Inês Martins, June 8, 2020. \n\nThe teeth of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) show their bodies metabolize metals — from chromium to zinc — in abnormal ways starting in infancy, and these changes predispose them to ALS disease as adults.\n\nThe study, which looked at how metal uptake early in life can affect adult health, may provide a basis for ALS screening programs and approaches that address metabolism, potentially preventing the neurodegenerative disease from developing.\n\nThe study, “Early life metal dysregulation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,” was published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology.\n\nExposure to metals is among the environmental risk factors thought to contribute to ALS. Abnormal metal metabolism causes changes in energy production, protein control, oxidative stress (cellular damage as a consequence of high levels of oxidant molecules), neuronal activation, and brain inflammation, all of which are known to play a role in ALS.\n\nBut it is unclear when in life patients begin to experience abnormal metal regulation.\n\nhttps://alsnewstoday.com/news-posts/2020/06/08/als-patient-teeth-show-abnormal-metabolism-of-metals-in-childhood-study/"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2BB6AQpK6Eg/maxresdefault.jpg)youtube.com"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"background-color:#eb6134; font-family:'Brush Script MT',cursive;color:white;font-size:200%; text-align:center;border-radius: 50% 20% / 10% 40%\">\"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.

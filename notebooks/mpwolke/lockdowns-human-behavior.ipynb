During a pandemic, fear is one of the central emotional responses and up to this point, most people have complied with lockdown conditions out of fear of becoming infected. But as time passes, people’s resolution may begin to fray.\n\nMore than 40 psychologists are currently reviewing research relevant to people’s behaviour during a pandemic to advance the fight against COVID-19.\n\n* The psychological factors that motivate us to stay in our bubble are a mix of individual, group and societal considerations.https://theconversation.com/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/21945.jpeg)statista.com"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Human behaviour and Reward principles, by Dougal Sutherland\n\nAt a very basic level, human behaviour is governed by reward principles.\n\nIf what we do is followed by a perceived reward, we’re more likely to keep doing it. Not getting sick is a reward, but it may not be perceived as such for much longer as most of us weren’t sick in the first place.\n\nThis lack of reward reinforcement could be intensified by an optimism bias - “It won’t happen to me” - which may become stronger than our anxiety as time passes and the perceived threat reduces.\n\nOutside of our individual psychology, broader social factors come into play. In times of uncertainty we look to others to guide our own behaviour as they set our social norms.\n\nOften, there is a degree of confusion about guidelines on what people are allowed to do, for example when exercising during lockdown. Seeing others out surfing, mountain biking and picnicking in a park can lead to a mindset of “if they’re doing it, why can’t I?”\n\nTo counter this, the government should continue to appeal to our sense of shared identity and highlight examples of punishment for rule breakers. But an over-emphasis on punishment risks people sticking to rules merely for social approval, which means they may conform in public but not in private. Being punished can also build resentment and may lead people to seeking out loopholes in the rules.\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from PIL import Image\n\nimage = Image.open(\"../input/cusersmarildownloads22048jpeg/22048.jpeg\")\nimage","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Script by Chris X https://www.kaggle.com/docxian/pixel-correlation-rows-columns"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport cv2\nfrom PIL import Image","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Group Behaviour,by Dougal Sutherland\n\nIn order to last the distance at the highest level of lockdown, people need to cooperate as a group. If everyone complies, we’ll all be OK.\n\nThe reverse was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic with the panic-induced buying of toilet paper, face masks and other “essentials”. Here we saw decision making based on emotion and the government attempting to counter it with fact-based information.\n\nThere is evidence that in times of major crises groups may prioritise their local interests, such as keeping your family, neighbourhood or wider community safe. Such as setting up road blocks around their communities to control access by people who are not local residents.\n\nBut this has the potential to spill over into vigilantism if local protection interests combine with fear. It can prioritise the interests of a few over the greater good.\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# load image\nimg = Image.open('../input/cusersmarildownloads22048jpeg/22048.jpeg')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Cultural factors,by Dougal Sutherland\n\nCultural and political psychology also has an impact on our behaviour during lockdown. Broadly speaking, different cultures can be categorised as “tight” or “loose”.\n\nTight cultures (China, Singapore) tend to be more rule bound and less open but are also associated with more order and self-regulation. In contrast, looser cultures (UK, USA) place more emphasis on individual freedoms and rights, and are correspondingly slow to self-regulate in the face of government requirements.\n\nAustralia appears to fall towards the looser end of the spectrum while New Zealanders sits somewhere in the middle. The challenge will be how we respond as our society continues to “tighten” with strict rules while boredom and annoyance sets in.\n\nPolitical polarisation, which has increased markedly in recent years, may be exacerbated by being physically distant from others. There is a danger that as we stay in our bubbles, both physical and virtual, we fall into “echo chambers” wherein we only hear similar voices and opinions to our own.\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-psychology-of-lockdown-suggests-sticking-to-rules-gets-harder-the-longer-it-continues-135927"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# show image\nplt.imshow(img)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Polarisation,Resentment and Freedom,  by Dougal Sutherland\n\nIf this chamber becomes filled with resentment at ongoing restraints on our freedom, it can break down our motivation to stay home.

It’s hard to know what to expect as alerts are relaxed.

Although times of significant threat or crisis can cause post-traumatic stress, research shows that so-called “adversarial growth” is just as common as a response. This is our capacity to not only overcome a crisis, but to actually grow stronger, wiser and more resilient.\n\nOften, adversity may help us experience a new appreciation of life, improve our relationships with others, and help us gain personal strength. In other words, what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.\n\n#The “fight, flight or freeze” and The “tend and befriend” Responses\n\nThe most common response to threats in humans is the “fight, flight or freeze” response, where stress triggers a hormonal response that prepares the body to either fight or run from a threat.\n\nBut more recent research shows we also have a “tend and befriend” response. When faced with a threat, this response releases hormones – like oxytocin – that encourage us to build and maintain our social network to reduce stress and anxiety, and build empathy.\n\n#Post-traumatic growth\n\nStudies looking at natural disasters show the “tend and befriend” response actually reduces incidents of post-traumatic stress disorder and promotes “post-traumatic growth”. These are positive psychological changes that happen in response to a traumatic event, including increased resilience, self-confidence, greater empathy, and improved subjective wellbeing.\nhttps://theconversation.com/facing-the-coronavirus-crisis-together-could-lead-to-positive-psychological-growth-134289"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# calc correlation of image COLUMNS\nimg_df_col = pd.DataFrame(img_R)\nimg_cor_col = img_df_col.corr()\nimg_cor_col","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Socialising, Empathy and Compassion by  Lowri Dowthwaite\n\nResearchers also acknowledge that experiencing this level of crisis will bring about painful emotions, uncertainty, physical suffering, and psychological distress. How we cope with this – either through the “fight or flight” or “tend and befriend” response – is vital to our psychological health as individuals and as a community.\n\nIf we can still regularly socialise – even virtually – this can help people bond, and build personal growth and social wellbeing in those affected by a collective trauma. This “communal coping” also makes us more open to making new friends. The “tend and befriend” response encourages empathy and compassion, gives us better social awareness, and makes us better able to understand the needs of others and how to behave in an empathetic and helpful way.\n\nThough stress is an understandable response during a time like this, choosing how you respond to it is important. The “tend and befriend” response will help us consider others in our community, and may be important for social distancing, and increasing charitable responses or acts of kindness. In the midst of a global crisis, this adaptive stress response may not only reduce incidents of anger, prejudice and violence, but may also foster collective humanity and post-pandemic growth.\nhttps://theconversation.com/facing-the-coronavirus-crisis-together-could-lead-to-positive-psychological-growth-134289"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# plot correlation matrix of COLUMNS\nplt.figure(figsize=(11,10))\nsns.heatmap(img_cor_col)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#How to overcome psychological forces, by Melissa Norberg and Derek Rucker\n\nWhile no perfect remedy exists, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) techniques can help people avoid making decisions based on unhelpful urges and emotions.

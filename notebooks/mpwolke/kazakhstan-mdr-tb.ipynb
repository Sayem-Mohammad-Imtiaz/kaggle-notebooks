Over the past decade, the number of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the most effective drugs against tuberculosis (ie, rifampicin and isoniazid), which is called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, has continued to increase.\n\nGlobally, 4·6% of patients with tuberculosis have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but in some areas, like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine, this proportion exceeds 25%. Treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is prolonged (ie, 9–24 months) and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have less favourable outcomes than those treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis.\n\nIndividualised multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment with novel (eg, bedaquiline) and repurposed (eg, linezolid, clofazimine, or meropenem) drugs and guided by genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can improve treatment outcomes. Some clinical trials are evaluating 6-month regimens to simplify management and improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Here they review optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis and their contacts.https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(19)31882-3/fulltext#articleInformation","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Drug-resistant TB\n\n![](http://www.unrussia.ru/sites/default/files/p2eng.png)http://www.unrussia.ru/en/un-in-russia/news/2017-03-24","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for presumptive multidrug-resistant TB cases registered at four sites in Kazakhstan from 1 August 2012 to 31 May 2013. \nFigure posted on 16.07.2015, 00:11 by Sanne Christine van Kampen Aigul Tursynbayeva Aliya Koptleuova Zauresh Murzabekova Lyazzat Bigalieva Moldir Aubakirova Svetlana Pak Susan van den Hof\n\n\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-plos-725668748/2179271/preview.jpg)https://plos.figshare.com/articles/_Diagnostic_and_treatment_algorithm_for_presumptive_multidrug_resistant_TB_cases_registered_at_four_sites_in_Kazakhstan_from_1_August_2012_to_31_May_2013_/1485997","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide.

The Green Light Committee initiative supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 90 countries. We used estimates from the Preserving Effective TB Treatment Study to predict MDR and XDR tuberculosis trends in four countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis: India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa.\n\nThe model forecasted the percentage of MDR tuberculosis among incident cases of tuberculosis to increase, reaching 12·4% (95% prediction interval 9·4–16·2) in India, 8·9% (4·5–11·7) in the Philippines, 32·5% (27·0–35·8) in Russia, and 5·7% (3·0–7·6) in South Africa in 2040. It also predicted the percentage of XDR tuberculosis among incident MDR tuberculosis to increase, reaching 8·9% (95% prediction interval 5·1–12·9) in India, 9·0% (4·0–14·7) in the Philippines, 9·0% (4·8–14·2) in Russia, and 8·5% (2·5–14·7) in South Africa in 2040. Acquired drug resistance would cause less than 30% of incident MDR tuberculosis during 2000–40. Acquired drug resistance caused 80% of incident XDR tuberculosis in 2000, but this estimate would decrease to less than 50% by 2040.\n\nMDR and XDR tuberculosis were forecast to increase in all four countries despite improvements in acquired drug resistance shown by the Green Light Committee-supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Additional control efforts beyond improving acquired drug resistance rates are needed to stop the spread of MDR and XDR tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis.https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(19)31882-3/fulltext#back-bib88","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking dataset\n\nprint (\"Rows     : \" ,df.shape[0])\nprint (\"Columns  : \" ,df.shape[1])\nprint (\"\\nFeatures : \\n\" ,df.columns.tolist())\nprint (\"\\nMissing values :  \", df.isnull().sum().values.sum())\nprint (\"\\nUnique values :  \\n\",df.nunique())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kazakhstan became the first country in the world to enter a second nationwide lockdown on July 5 following a spike in coronavirus cases. The two-week lockdown, which could be extended if the spread of the virus continues, restricts public gatherings and bans family and holiday gatherings. Citizens over 65 are expected to stay home, but others are allowed to exercise outdoors on their own.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Kazakhstan has grown tenfold since the first lockdown measures began to be lifted. By May 11, the last day of the state of emergency and lockdown, Kazakhstan had registered 5,207 coronavirus cases and 32 deaths. As of July 13, there were 59,899 confirmed coronavirus cases and 375 deaths in the country. But the situation is evolving quickly and could be a lot worse than this.\n\nSerious concerns have been raised about the pneumonia data. Between July 1 and 8, Kazakhstan registered 56,809 cases of pneumonia – on top of the confirmed cases of COVID-19. These pneumonia cases included the “usual pneumonia” – viral (7,348) and bacterial (9,759) – as well as 39,702 “unspecified” viral pneumonia cases which have a similar course of disease as coronavirus, according to the health minister.

It also introduced a substantial package of financial measures to fight the pandemic, and monthly payments for people who lost their income during the state of emergency in April and May.\n\nBut once the quarantine measures eased, many Kazakhstani citizens began to ignore social-distancing guidance. Many underestimated the risks of the virus: they hurried to offices, cafes, pubs, parks and fitness centres. Families gathered for large weddings, birthdays and funerals. Soon, initial optimism about the government’s handling of the virus would be replaced with panic, helplessness and disillusion.\n\nAs a result of the spike in coronavirus and pneumonia cases, citizens have complained about overcrowded hospitals, lack of COVID-19 tests, long queues for testing laboratories and pharmacies, and a deficit of medicines.\n\nPanic-buying of medicines has led to speculation and the sale of drugs on the black market at much higher prices. At the outbreak of the pandemic, Kazakhstan received international humanitarian support, including from the US, China and Russia. Now social media has been flooded with photos of medicines bought at pharmacies with stickers showing they were donated as humanitarian aid and so should not be for sale.https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-kazakhstan-denies-unknown-pneumonia-reports-but-has-imposed-second-national-lockdown-142523","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Columns\n\n\n\"`e_mdr_pct_rr_new`\",\"Estimates\",,\"Estimated

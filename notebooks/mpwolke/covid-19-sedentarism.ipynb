In fact, the immune system, which is a key player in the pathogenesis of COVID‐19, also plays an important role in obesity‐induced adipose tissue inflammation. This inflammation of adipose tissue results in metabolic dysfunction potentially leading to dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.13034"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ6I1KwX4nch95kH9YnrPPMjWLbyBxYK3jguwrIoiL2-kpxHwED&usqp=CAU',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"localsyr.com"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import feature_extraction, linear_model, model_selection, preprocessing\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By analogy to other respiratory infections, obesity may play an important role in COVID‐19 transmission. For example, in the case of influenza A, obesity increases the duration of virus shedding; symptomatic patients with obesity shed virus 42% longer than adults who do not have obesity. In H1N1 influenza, obesity is an independent risk factor for hospitalization and death.\n\nSince obesity has been shown to increase vulnerability to infections, it may be a risk factor for COVID‐19‐related mortality.3 This is all the more so since there are no specific clinical signs that foreshadow the progression from a mild COVID‐19 infection to a severe form. Compared with normal patients, BMI(body mass index) was significantly higher in patients with a severe form of COVID‐19 infection.\n\nThe authors concluded that the highest BMI(body mass index) was more often seen in critical cases and non‐survivors. Thrombotic events were an aggravating cause of death.5 Thromboembolic risk is known to be higher in patients with obesity than in the general population. It logically follows that obesity can be an aggravating risk factor for death from COVID‐19 infection. \nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/obr.13034"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/uncover/UNCOVER/us_cdc/us_cdc/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"hist = df[['locationid','yearstart']]\nbins = range(hist.locationid.min(), hist.locationid.max()+10, 5)\nax = hist.pivot(columns='yearstart').locationid.plot(kind = 'hist', stacked=True, alpha=0.5, figsize = (10,5), bins=bins, grid=False)\nax.set_xticks(bins)\nax.grid('on', which='major', axis='x')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bboxtoanchor=(1.1, 1.05)\n#seaborn.set(rc={'axes.facecolor':'03fc28', 'figure.facecolor':'03fc28'})\ndf.plot.area(y=['yearstart','yearend','locationid'],alpha=0.4,figsize=(12, 6));","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The Adipose Tissue - Adipocytes\n\nOne explanation of the above findings is that COVID‐19 has high affinity for human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Tissue expression of ACE2 differs in kidneys, heart, and lungs of healthy patients and coronavirus‐infected patients.\n\nThe level of ACE2 expression in `adipose tissue` is higher than that in lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by COVID‐19.

There was a new virus in the square with the potential to spread quickly. Experts also pointed to the epicenter: the city of Wuhan, China. The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued the warning on January 6. The World Health Organization, on the 9th. The difference between competent traditional bodies and BlueDot is only one: artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Experts also pointed to the epicenter: the city of Wuhan, China. And also correctly predicted that the first cities outside China to notice cases of the virus would be Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo.\n\nBlueDot works with three sources to feed its databases. The news published by journalistic websites in 65 different languages, air traffic and animal epidemiology reports. Crossing the news, sometimes just small notes, with reports of infectious diseases in animals, they are able to notice an epidemic being born. Join the package as the planes come and go and they are able to establish, probabilistically, where the people who were exposed to the new virus are going.\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report/discussion/128472\nhttps://oglobo.globo.com/economia/o-epidemiologista-digital-24220810\n"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQlG_n5AofvAGt6A_IwuJkc1b6et0rMVCVizzRacpMh19RKP0NN9A&s',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Image cister.fm"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/corona-virus-report/novel corona virus situation report who.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"China\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"Nepal\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"India\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"Germany\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"France\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"USA\"].plot.hist()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"China\"].plot.box()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona[\"USA\"].plot.box()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I don't know how to interpret this boxplots.

Otherwise we're going to experiment other epidemies since the World is fully connected.\n\nHealth promotion programs aim to engage and empower individuals and communities to choose healthy behaviors, and make changes that reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases and other morbidities. Defined by the World Health Organization(WHO), health promotion is: \n“The process of enabling people to increase control over, and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behavior towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions.” \n\nHealth promotion and disease prevention programs often address social determinants of health, which influence modifiable risk behaviors. Social determinants of health are the economic, social, cultural, and political conditions in which people are born, grow, and live that affect health status. Modifiable risk behaviors include, for example, tobacco use, poor eating habits, and lack of physical activity, which contribute to the development of chronic disease. \n\nTypical activities for health promotion, disease prevention, and wellness programs include: communication, education, policy systems and environment. https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/toolkits/health-promotion/1/definition"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Kaggle Notebook Runner \"Epidemiologist\": Marília Prata @mpwolke"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

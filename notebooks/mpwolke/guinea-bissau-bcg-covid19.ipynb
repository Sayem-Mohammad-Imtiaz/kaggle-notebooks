Recent studies have suggested that BCG may have a nonspecific beneficial effect on infant mortality. They evaluated the consequences of not vaccinating LBW (low birth weight) children at birth in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nBetween 1989 and 1999, 7138 children born at the central hospital had a birth weight registered. They assessed BCG coverage until 3 years of age. Data on tuberculin skin test (TST) for 297 children and BCG scar for 1319 children in the study population were reanalyzed for differences between normal birth weight (NBW) children and LBW children. They assessed the effect of early BCG vaccination on mortality to 12 months of age.\n\nAmong LBW children there were 1.5- to 3-fold more unvaccinated individuals than among NBW children up to 4 months of age. There was no overall difference between LBW and NBW children in TST or BCG scarring; LBW children vaccinated early may have had slightly reduced reactions to tuberculin. Among 845 LBW children, 182 had received BCG within the first week of life. Controlling for background factors and censoring at first diphtheria-tetanuspertussis vaccination, measles vaccination or at 6 months of age (whichever came first), the mortality rate ratio for BCG-vaccinated versus -unvaccinated LBW children was 0.17 (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.06-0.49), with an even stronger effect for LBW children vaccinated in the first week of life (mortality rate ratio, 0.07; 95 per cent confidence interval, 0.01-0.62).\n\nThe policy of not vaccinating with BCG at birth had a negative impact on vaccination coverage for LBW children. Early BCG vaccination had no large negative impact on TST and BCG scarring. Mortality was lower for BCG-vaccinated than for unvaccinated LBW children controlling for available background factors. BCG vaccination of LBW children may have a beneficial effect on survival that cannot be explained by protection against tuberculosis. Future studies should examine possible adverse effects from equalizing BCG policy for LBW and NBW children.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15194836/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTQXRC8iSNx0JbH7N0C_bA-bmOPqbJtVN1gG_3bi0536aQL9LEnM3_5eCRG0r8wOyxo0hMTP4NsQHrM00oac5MNIQ&usqp=CAU&ec=45687378)covid19gb.com","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Coronavirus Drugs—To Have and Have Not by Joelle Dountio O.\nAfrica's least developed countries should apply a WTO patent waiver, to import generic versions of future COVID-19 drugs\n\n![](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/Joelle.Ofimboudem-CoV-Patents-4.30.20-RTX7EKXB-THREE-TWO.jpg)https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/tag/guinea-bissau","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Covid-19: State of emergency extended until August 24 in Guinea-Bissau\n\nPresident Umaro Sissoco Embaló decided to prolong the state of emergency for the seventh time, \"considering the evolution of the epidemiological situation in the country, translated by the increase in the number of confirmed cases\".\n\n\nThe state of emergency ended this Saturday (25.07) at 00:00 local time.

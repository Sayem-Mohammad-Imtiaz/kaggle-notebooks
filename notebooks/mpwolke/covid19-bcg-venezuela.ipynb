The level of poverty it has reached in recent years, and which has continued to grow between 2019 and 2020, puts the country, which has the largest reserves of world oil , on a different scale. These are the conclusions of the most recent Venezuelan Living Conditions Survey (Encovi, in the Spanish acronym), carried out by a group of universities annually since 2014 and considered the most accurate x-ray of the country's social situation since the government stopped to publish statistics.\n\n\nAfter a decade of oil boom, ended in 2014, today the country is the poorest in the region and the second most unequal - behind only Brazil - according to calculations made from interviews in almost 10,000 households. The data reflects the economic collapse, in addition to the demographic and social adjustment caused by the forced emigration of five million Venezuelans.\nhttps://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue\n\n\nAnalyzing other aspects, such as employment, education, housing conditions and public services, poverty reaches 65% of Venezuelan households - having increased by 13.8% between 2018 and 2019.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i0.wp.com/www.gov.br/defesa/pt-br/assuntos/noticias/refugiados-venezuelanos-recebem-atendimento-humanitario-no-brasil/md_noticias_20200620_not02_f01.jpeg/@@images/e85230f6-8cab-4c1f-9ba6-8041f27aa2c8.jpeg?w=660&ssl=1)\nPhoto: Operation Acolhida disclosure https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://www.ecoamazonia.org.br/2020/06/refugiados-venezuelanos-recebem-atendimento-humanitario-brasil/&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Venezuela has never had levels of poverty like the one we are seeing, neither in the 20th century nor in the 21st century.

Among them, 79 per cent are in extreme poverty - that is, the income is not enough to buy a basic food basket. This level of poverty has been registered in the country in the last three years of hyperinflation and, for researchers, it is the result of a 70 per cent drop in GDP between 2013 and 2019.\n\nIn general, they are all poor, there is no wealth to distribute or well-being to enjoy.\nhttps://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/VE/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_table(\"/kaggle/input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/VE/Venezuela-es-result-21.txt\",header=None)\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df1[:2500])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nAnalyzing other aspects, such as employment, education, housing conditions and public services, poverty reaches 65 per cent of Venezuelan households - having increased by 13.8 per cent between 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe research included a new indicator called consumption poverty, which points out that 68 per cent of the population consumes less than the amount considered necessary for food per day, 2,000 calories. Food insecurity and precarious services have become an equalizing factor. Among the poorest and richest sectors, there are no notable differences in these aspects.\n\nAlthough higher-income citizens consume five times more meat than the poorest, the majority of the population eats below the recommended protein per day: 51 grams. Only 32 per cent of the population manages to ingest the necessary. To this factor is added the anthropometric data on child malnutrition: 30 per cent of children under the age of five - about 639 thousand people - have chronic malnutrition or short stature. The percentage is much higher than that of neighboring countries, being only lower than that of Guatemala.\n\nIn terms of poverty and malnutrition, the country has acquired conditions that are similar to those of others in Central America, the Caribbean and Africa. https://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=en&sl=pt&u=https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/venezuela-79-da-populacao-esta-em-extrema-pobreza-mostra-estudo-24521940&prev=search&pto=aue\n\nLuis Pedro España also stresses that ending extreme poverty would require a direct transfer program equivalent to US $ 5 billion per year, which would allow giving two dollars a day to 6.5 million families.\n\nThe policy, however, is not viable for the government of Nicolás Maduro, who suffers from the fall in oil production and is involved in a deep political and legitimacy crisis, cornered by international sanctions.\n\n- The State is deeply poor in order to be able to undertake this program and relaunch the economy, and, until we are able to enter the international financial system, we will be mired in precariousness - adds the sociologist.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/BCG_world_atlas_data-2020.csv')\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The composition of the Venezuelan population has also changed in recent years. There are less than four million inhabitants in the country, and in 19 per cent  of households someone emigrated between 2014 and 2019. Another of the study's conclusions confirms that the so-called demographic bonus has been lost. This factor is the result of a reduction in the fertility rate - families having fewer children - and a decrease in the mortality of a population - that is, people living longer. As a result, there is a greater proportion of citizens of working age - between 15 and 64 years old - in relation to the dependent population, children and the elderly.\n\n\nAll efforts to expand mass access to university education have lost their meaning. These benefits do not reach the poorest sectors.\n\nThe gloomy situation will worsen because of the pandemic .

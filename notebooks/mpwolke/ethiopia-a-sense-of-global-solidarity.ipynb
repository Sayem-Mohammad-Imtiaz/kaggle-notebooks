The government's rapid response, including house-to-house screenings and diagnostic testings, were crucial in stemming the outbreak. Ethiopia has also encouraged production and other economic activities to continue during the crisis.\n\nTo the surprise of many, African governments have responded swiftly and boldly to the COVID-19 crisis. Ethiopia’s unconventional approach, for example, reflects the country’s limited financial and human resources, as well as the low level of available international support. Despite these severe constraints, the results so far have been better than anyone expected.\n\nFrom the start, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government understood that Ethiopia’s success in combating COVID-19 would depend not on the number of respirators it had, but on the public-health measures taken to contain the virus’s spread. His government also wanted to prevent serious damage to one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies, which expanded at a 10.5% average annual rate in 2004-18 but remains vulnerable. Safeguarding these gains, preventing job losses, and ensuring firms’ survival was critical.\n\nSo, instead of implementing a national lockdown like most other governments, including in Africa, Ethiopia initiated other essential measures in January, well ahead of most developed countries. The government then scaled up its response in mid-March, when the first COVID-19 case was reported in the country, and declared a state of emergency only on April 8. Moreover, it has encouraged production and other economic activities to continue during the crisis, thus considerably easing the pressure on vulnerable social groups and the informal sector.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ethiopia-covid19-response/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan, 2015 - The structure of Ethiopiua's healthcare system.\n![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/responsive_large_webp_b_uz27smrzu7IBNXeM-Z03oGF1d-QGm15yalYgThKk8.webp)\nThe Ethiopian government has relied heavily on community mobilization and public-awareness campaigns, which have proved to be effective and cost-efficient. It has also relied on the country’s prevention-based primary public health-care infrastructure and the health extension system that was built up during the last two decades.\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ethiopia-covid19-response/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The results so far are salutary, though we fear the worst may be yet to come. As of May 26, Ethiopia – with a population of 109 million – had reported only 701 cases and six deaths. That represents an infection rate of 0.8 per cent among the tested population, 80 per cent of whom are 24-44 years old.\n\nThe government’s rapid initial response was crucial. In January, it introduced strict passenger-screening protocols at Addis Ababa’s international airport, East Africa’s largest aviation hub. The Ministry of Health and local and regional governments jointly conducted house-to-house screenings of more than 11 million households containing 40 million people in the capital and provinces. And diagnostic testing was scaled up from zero in early March to over 5,000 tests per day by May, though it continues to be a major challenge.\n\nPublic awareness and education have been central to the government’s effort. The prime minister makes regular public announcements regarding COVID-19, while the health minister provides daily briefings. And, as part of a concerted media campaign to reach all citizens, state-owned telecoms monopoly Ethio Telecom uses cell-phone ring tones to remind people of the importance of hygiene measures such as hand washing, social distancing, and wearing facemasks. This platform has shown positive effects.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ethiopia-covid19-response/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ls ../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/ET/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Ethiopia = '../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/ET/Ethiopia-en-result-111-original.txt'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Furthermore, since February, the Ethiopian authorities have implemented a strict regime of rigorous contact tracing, isolation, compulsory quarantine, and treatment. The government converted public universities’ dormitories to increase the capacity of quarantine centers to over 50,000 beds, established additional isolation centers with a total of 15,000 beds, and set up treatment centers with a 5,000-bed capacity. It also introduced more comprehensive life insurance coverage to protect front-line health workers.\n\nWhereas many advanced and emerging economies have introduced huge economic-stimulus and rescue plans, the Ethiopian government has been constrained by dwindling revenues and the need to reallocate budget expenditures to contain the pandemic. It cannot please everyone, and therefore has had to prioritize its modest resources.\n\nThe government’s COVID-19 economic-support package is based on the principle of shared costs and sacrifices. For example, the employers’ confederation, labor unions, and the government agreed on a tripartite protocol to prevent layoffs during the crisis. Government subsidies have enabled manufacturing exporters to benefit from zero-cost rail transport and lower export logistics costs. And the government’s new industrial-parks strategy envisages the establishment of manufacturing hubs to produce personal protective equipment for domestic and overseas markets.\n\nEthiopia continues to mobilize national resources and encourage voluntary activities to address the public-health emergency, with the government ensuring close coordination among federal agencies at all levels. And although the government’s pandemic response is a work in progress, its success so far illustrates what African countries can achieve despite tight resource constraints.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ethiopia-covid19-response/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text = open(Ethiopia, 'r',encoding='utf-8',\n                 errors='ignore').read()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(text[:2700])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Codes from Paul Mooney (visualization of most common words)\n\n%matplotlib inline\ndef plotWordFrequency(input):\n    f = open(Ethiopia,'r')\n    words = [x for y in [l.split() for l in f.readlines()] for x in y]\n    data = sorted([(w, words.count(w)) for w in set(words)], key = lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)[:40] \n    most_words = [x[0] for x in data]\n    times_used = [int(x[1]) for x in data]\n    plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\n    plt.bar(x=sorted(most_words), height=times_used, color = 'green', edgecolor = 'black',  width=.5)\n    plt.xticks(rotation=45, fontsize=18)\n    plt.yticks(rotation=0, fontsize=18)\n    plt.xlabel('Most Common Words:', fontsize=18)\n    plt.ylabel('Number of Occurences:', fontsize=18)\n    plt.title('Most Commonly Used Words: %s' % (Ethiopia), fontsize=24)\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Ethiopia = '../input/hackathon/task_1-google_search_txt_files_v2/ET/Ethiopia-en-result-111-original.txt'\nplotWordFrequency(Ethiopia)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The government ensured a coherent response by maximizing coordination among public agencies at different levels.

Governments must prioritize and target their limited resources at companies, and tie that support to performance criteria in order to incentivize vital social goals like employment retention. Learning what works and what does not in that regard has been a vital catalyst in Ethiopia’s response.\n\nFinally, it is too early to judge the pandemic response mounted by Ethiopia and other African countries because governments still have to scale up their efforts to tackle the inevitable “surge” stage of the crisis. But one lesson is already clear: African governments’ COVID-19 strategies must reflect the local context, the evolving nature of the pandemic, binding resource constraints, and weak international collaboration.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/ethiopia-covid19-response/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-Tuberculosis_infection_estimates_for_2018.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQTRS-rkWYBJw03jtZCPbMTR_qLsarc-I2jcA&usqp=CAU)caasint","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One of the most perverse effects of the new coronavirus pandemic was the international dispute over medical supplies.

By ABIY AHMED-Prime minister of Ethiopia and the 2019 Nobel #Peace prize laureate - MARCH 25 2020\n\nThere is a major flaw in the strategy to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Advanced economies are unveiling unprecedented economic stimulus packages. African countries, by contrast, lack the wherewithal to make similarly meaningful interventions. Yet if the virus is not defeated in Africa, it will only bounce back to the rest of the world. \n\nThat is why the current strategy of uncoordinated country-specific measures, while understandable, is myopic, unsustainable and potentially counter-productive. A virus that ignores borders cannot be tackled successfully like this.\n\nWe can defeat this invisible and vicious adversary — but only with global leadership. Without that, Africa may suffer the worst, yet it will not be the last. We are all in this together, and we must work together to the end.\n\nFragile and vulnerable at the best of times, African economies are staring at an abyss.\tThis grim reality is not unique to Ethiopia. It is shared by most African countries. But if they do not take appropriate measures to tackle the pandemic, no country in the world is safe. \n\nMomentary victory by a rich country in controlling the virus at a national level, coupled with travel bans and border closures, may give a semblance of accomplishment. But we all know this is a stopgap. Only global victory can bring this pandemic to an end.\n\nCovid-19 teaches us that we are all global citizens connected by a single virus that recognises none of our natural or man-made diversity: not the colour of our skin, nor our passports, or the gods we worship. For the virus, what matters is the fact of our common humanity.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/c12a09c8-6db6-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\nHealth is a worldwide public good.

As reported in this issue of Molecular Therapy, Zhang and colleagues have now compared phenotypic and genotypic information of 13 different BCG strains with data on their virulence and vaccine efficacy in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and BALB/c mice, respectively.\n\nThe authors concluded that the distinct levels of virulence of the various strains might be linked to strain-specific duplications and deletions of genomic regions. Moreover, the authors observed a general trend whereby BCG strains showing higher virulence in SCID mice induced better protection against a Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge in BALB/c mice3 relative to less virulent BCG strains. These observations have important implications for current BCG vaccination programs and are of particular relevance for both ongoing and future alternative TB vaccine development approaches.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817828/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By Daria Bottai1 and Roland Brosch\n![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817828/bin/mt201618f1.jpg) \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817828/\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Figure above is a representation of genealogy of BCG daughter strains. Comparative genomic analyses identified several gene-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as well as large-sequence polymorphisms (genomic deletions, tandem duplications, insertion sequences IS6110) both in BCG vaccines relative to virulent strains of M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, and among the different BCG daughter strains. The scheme shows regions of difference (RD), insertions (in), deletions (del), and SNPs, which differentiate the various BCG strains. The brown and blue dashed ellipses indicate tandem duplications DU1 (exclusively restricted to BCG Pasteur) and DU2 (present in the BCG substrains in four possible forms), which enable classification of BCG strains into four major lineages. \n\nNote that in other phylogenies (e.g., ref. 10), BCG China/BCG Beijing belongs to a cluster closely related to BCG Danish. It seems likely that two different groups of BCG exist that are both named BCG China or BCG Beijing. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4817828/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport nltk\nimport string\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport re\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"BCG, an attenuated anti-TB vaccine, is one of the most well-known examples of globally used vaccines developed in the twentieth century.

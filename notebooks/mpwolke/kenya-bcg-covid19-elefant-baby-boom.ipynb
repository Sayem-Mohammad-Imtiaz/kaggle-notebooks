The new guidelines were drafted in accordance with the World Health Organization’s recommendations.\n\nPreviously, Kenya’s authorities forcibly quarantined tens of thousands of people in facilities that lacked proper sanitation, were crowded and confined, and did not provide people with personal protective equipment like face masks. These conditions increased the risk of Covid-19 transmission, rather than protecting those who were in quarantine.\n\nThe report detailed how quarantine in a government facility was forced upon Kenyans who had displayed Covid-19-like symptoms, travelers or those that had encountered travelers, and those who broke curfew or did not wear a face mask in public. In one instance, a mother was forced to quarantine along with her month-old child for breaking curfew by ten minutes.\n\nConditions in the government quarantine facilities were often dire. People reported limited access to food and water, personal protective equipment, proper ventilation, appropriate bedding, and cleaning supplies. People also spoke of physically and emotionally abusive practices in the facilities, such as blocking people who could not afford to pay for their involuntary accommodation from leaving the facilities, and in one instance even calling the police to beat them. https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/07/31/kenya-stops-abusive-forced-quarantine-related-covid-19","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#UN Volunteers support joint COVID-19 response in Kenya\n\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRVVLFwyDwffoLlUD_1YpWnJegXPbgupstXQw&usqp=CAU)unv.org","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The new guidelines outline home-based isolation care for infected persons with mild symptoms and have been received well across the country.

Kilimanjaro now has a new claim to fame: An elephant baby boom. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, Amboseli National Park has seen a record 140 newborn pachyderms welcomed into the world. The high numbers can be attributed to the lack of tourist interruptions and abundant rains that have left rich vegetation, which serves as food for the grey giants. The mass birth announcement comes as World Elephant Day is celebrated on Aug. 12.\n\n“Greetings from Amboseli Kenya,” \n\n“It has been a difficult year for all of us but there is still much to celebrate. Here in Amboseli, elephants are thriving. 140 beautiful calves have been born in 2020 and more are expected.” Twin baby elephant calves are among those registered in the record tally by park officials. Amid a dearth in tourists, the Kenya Wildlife Service has seen a spike in poaching of wildlife for game meat.\n\nAnimals are not targeted for their skin, ivory, horns, or other game products but solely for meat for local communities. This is a threat that has always followed elephants.\n\nDespite the good news in Kenya’s protected Amboseli National Park, “across Africa they face enormous challenges, due to COVID-19 there has been a collapse of tourism and the competition between humans and elephants for land has increased.”https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/kenya-wildlife-park-sees-elephant-baby-boom/1939402","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Univariate

By comparison, Britain’s rate is 394, the US’s is 193, Spain’s is 525, and Italy’s is 463. So why is Belgium’s relative death toll so high?\n\nIn many ways, Belgium was well protected to weather the virus storm: it moved relatively swiftly to impose lockdown restrictions and its healthcare system is recognized as one of the best in the world. Yet as of Friday, it had recorded a total of 7,703 coronavirus deaths and 49,032 cases. In absolute fatalities, Belgium is in sixth place worldwide. Germany, next door, has registered just 6,632 deaths, but it has a population of 83 million, compared to Belgium’s 11.5 million.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#codes from Rodrigo Lima  @rodrigolima82\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nImage(url = 'https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/belgium-flag-futuristic-digital-abstract-composition-coronavirus-inscription-covid-outbreak-concept-belgium-flag-173661510.jpg',width=400,height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Mikhailo Polenok - dreamstime"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Counting Fatalities\n\nBut Belgium’s high numbers have less to do with the spread of the disease and more to do with the way it counts fatalities. Its figures include all the deaths in the country’s more than 1,500 nursing homes, even those untested for the virus. These numbers add up to more than half of the overall figure.\n\nAccording to Belgium's Federal Public Service for Health, just 46 per cent of the country's total official deaths were in hospitals where coronavirus cases were confirmed. But 53 per cent of the Belgian tally, or 4,100 people, were from care homes, and of these, 84 per cent are suspected but unconfirmed coronavirus deaths.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmés says the government chose “full transparency when communicating deaths linked to Covid-19,” even if it leads to “numbers that are sometimes overestimated.” Health Minister Maggie De Block says Belgium is setting an example in diagnosing the disease. “In Europe, no country counts like the others.

But other countries are now adding care home deaths to their overall tally, including Britain – although the UK does not go as far as including those not confirmed by tests.\n\nSteven Van Gucht, the head of the viral disease division at the Sciensano Public-Health Institute, says he is not bothered by charts showing Belgium at the top. “If you want to compare our numbers with other countries, then you have to divide it by two,” he says. Mr Van Gucht, who is also a virology professor at Ghent University, says the measure also helped increase political pressure to do more in care homes. “We do this because we want to save lives. In that way, the system worked,” he says.\n\nBut the system is controversial, as it means deaths from diabetes, heart failure, hypertension and other problems are included in the Covid-19 tally. Virologist Marc Van Ranst, from Leuven University (KUL), has described it as “stupid” because it gives the impression that the coronavirus is the only cause of death in care homes.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#seaborn.set(rc={'axes.facecolor':'#27F1E7', 'figure.facecolor':'#27F1E7'})\nsns.countplot(df[\"tx_rgn_descr_nl\"])\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Elderly, Nursing Homes and Comply with the Restrictions. \n\nBelgium’s decision also showed how exposed elderly people are. Vincent Fredericq, the director-general of care home federation Femarbel, says the elderly were left behind in the rush to prepare hospitals. “They saw what happened in Italy and how their hospitals were overwhelmed. So there were instructions to hospitalize people from care homes as little as possible,” he says. “We were treated like the second class. And in the end, the hospitals were not overwhelmed – they actually had spare beds available in the intensive care units.” Indeed, even at the disease’s peak in Belgium, in early April, ICUs were only at 57 per cent capacity.\n\nBelgium is now testing the more than 240,000 residents and staff at nursing homes, and the early figures show a 9 per cent infection rate for care home residents and 4 per cent for personnel. But Mr Fredericq admits that it is hard to predict how many people died from the coronavirus in care homes. “The average age of residents is 85-86, and their average stay is just 16 months. There is an inevitable high mortality, so they could have died anyway,” he says.\n\nBelgium also benefits from a relative political calm, and firm popular backing for the prime minister: Mrs Wilmés is widely praised for her calm, clear and reassuring leadership. Scientists, like Mr Van Gucht, lead the daily briefings, not politicians. And Belgians generally comply with the restrictions, despite the occasional ‘lockdown parties’.\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/coronavirus-belgium-death-toll-lockdown-trump-who-uk-spain-italy-a9494186.html"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#seaborn.set(rc={'axes.facecolor':'#27F1E7', 'figure.facecolor':'#27F1E7'})\nsns.countplot(df[\"tx_adm_dstr_descr_fr\"])\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#The main wave of infections and Flattening the Curve. \n\nOfficials now believe that the main wave of infections came from Italy in the last week of February. “We were hit hard and suddenly in carnival holidays,” says Mr Van Gucht. “Italy is very popular with Belgians at that time of the year: the food is good, the ski is good, and you can go by car. We know it came from there because when we checked the genetic sequences, there were multiple interactions in Italy.”\n\nBelgium now seems to have flattened the curve: on Friday, it reported 130 fatalities overall (83 in care homes), and 513 new cases.

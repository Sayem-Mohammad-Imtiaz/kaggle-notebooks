The services sector is projected to grow by only 1 percent in 2020 due to lower trade (imports are expected to fall by 7 percent) and travel. Travel to Rwanda has fallen by 70 percent, which has caused a major impact on the tourism industry.\n\nThe agricultural sector, which is a major economic driver, was also impacted, further to the already expected decline because of adverse weather. A reduction in demand due to COVID-19 as well as a drop in international prices of export crops has made the situation worse. The industrial sector will also slow because of a drop in demand and delays in foreign direct investment in the construction sector.\n\nEconomic growth is projected to slow down to 2 percent in 2020 from 9.4 percent in 2019. In the medium term, the economy is expected to recover with growth reaching 6.3 percent in 2021, and back to its average growth of 8 percent in 2022. https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/08/06/na080620-rwanda-harnesses-technology-to-fight-covid-19-drive-recovery","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Sweetviz codes from Taha07 https://www.kaggle.com/taha07/sweetviz-automated-eda/notebook ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pip install sweetviz","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Rwanda’s use of grassroots networks. An innovative way to assist households.\n\nIn the year 2000, Rwanda adopted the National Decentralization Policy—a “people centered” policy that uses grassroots networks and local governments to help lessen shocks on households and alleviate poverty. Household assistance is based on Ubudehe categorization, a long-standing cultural value of mutual assistance that was also adopted by the government as a poverty reduction strategy.\n\nUbudehe is a socio-economic stratification system that provides support for Rwandans in lower categories with social protection schemes such as cash transfer, public works, access to agricultural inputs, shelter, health, and education with the aim to graduate to higher categories. The process has been useful in identifying vulnerable households—through community-based identification, the Ubudehe database, and other means—that need assistance as a result of the crisis. In 2018, core social protection programs covered 6.5 percent of the population. These are being scaled up to cover more people in this period of pandemic.https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/08/06/na080620-rwanda-harnesses-technology-to-fight-covid-19-drive-recovery","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/hackathon/task_2-BCG_world_atlas_data-bcg_strain-7July2020.csv', encoding='utf8')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In April 2020, the government established an Economic Recovery Fund that will be bolstered through emergency assistance from the IMF’s Rapid Credit Facility.

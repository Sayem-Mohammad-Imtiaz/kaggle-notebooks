NIV very significantly improves survival, quality of life and cognitive performances.\"\n\n\"The initial NIV settings are simple, but progression of the disease, ventilator dependence and upper airway involvement sometimes make long‐term adjustment of NIV more difficult, with a major impact on survival. Unique data concerning the long‐term adjustment of NIV in ALS show that correction of leaks, management of obstructive apnoea and adaptation to the patient's degree of ventilator dependence improve the prognosis.\"\n\n\"Non‐ventilatory factors also impact the efficacy of NIV and various solutions have been described and must be applied, including cough assist techniques, control of excess salivation and renutrition. NIV in ALS has been considerably improved as a result of application of all of these measures, avoiding the need for tracheostomy in the very great majority of cases. More advanced use of NIV also requires pulmonologists to master the associated end‐of‐life palliative care, as well as the modalities of discontinuing ventilation when it becomes unreasonable.\"\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/resp.13525"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/end-als/end-als/clinical-data/filtered-metadata/metadata/clinical/NIV_Log.csv', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nRowsRead = 1000 # specify 'None' if want to read whole file\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('../input/cusersmarildownloadsaltmancsv/altman.csv', delimiter=';', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows = nRowsRead)\ndf1.dataframeName = 'altman.csv'\nnRow, nCol = df1.shape\nprint(f'There are {nRow} rows and {nCol} columns')\ndf1.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cols_to_drop=['Unnamed: 2','Unnamed: 3', 'Unnamed: 4', 'Unnamed: 5']\ndf1=df1.drop(cols_to_drop,axis=1)\ndf1.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#DC143C;\">INDICATION OF NIV</span>**\n\n\"Some patients are able to use their accessory muscles during REM sleep, as a result of an as yet unexplained phenotypic change.

This improvement is even observed in patients with bulbar muscle involvement (muscles controlling speech, mastication and swallowing), considered to be poor candidates for NIV in 2006, with a survival gain of 19 months over those with non‐bulbar phenotypes.

As discussed below, only a few studies have proposed the so‐called early ventilation prior to onset of hypoventilation.\"\n\n\"From a database comprising more than 600 patients, showed that in more than 80% of cases NIV was initiated at a stage of daytime hypoventilation with a median PaCO2(arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide)of 48 mm Hg. However, all guidelines recommend that the indication for NIV be based on pulmonary function parameters, nocturnal oximetry or even plasma bicarbonate, although these recommendations are not contradictory.\n\n\"In view of the nature and rapid progression of ALS, three‐monthly assessments are necessary to determine the appropriate time to initiate NIV. However, three‐monthly assessments of PCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide)are not practical due to the painful and invasive nature of arterial blood gases and/or the cost of percutaneous measurements.\"\n\n\"The best examination at present to detect hypoventilation is the SNIFF TEST with a sensitivity of 97% for a SNIFF <40 cm H2O. This is much better than that of vital capacity (VC), which has a sensitivity of only 58% for a value <50%.

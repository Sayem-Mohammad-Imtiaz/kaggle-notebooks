However, initially Koch had to face two types of difficulty: (i) in the conceptual order, the ideas of Virchow relating defects and poor functioning of the organism as the cause of the pathology still prevailed, ruling out the existence of external inducing agents, and (ii) unforeseen consequences of the investigation itself, given that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most complicated microbes to grow and stain in the laboratory.\n\n    \n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">The Koch-Henle postulates</p>\n    \nWith the end of proving his hypothesis, he strictly followed the protocol of the Koch-Henle postulates. In this way, he first identified the bacillus dyed in sick patients’ tissues, after using distinct staining procedures (ie, methylene blue, brown vesuvine, heating to 40°C to reduce the length of time, etc), until succeeding in dying the complex and robust wall of the mycobacteria (P. Ehrlich later perfected the method by introducing anilines. Koch also described the macrophages as a reservoir of the bacteria.\n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Die Äethiologie der Tuberkulose</p>\n    \n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">The methodology of pure cultures</p>\n    \nWorking alone in his small private laboratory outside of the university, Koch succeeded in proving the validity of various postulates that established the presence of live contagion in sick organisms, including the isolation in pure culture of this contagion from the host and the reproduction of disease when transferring the contagion to a susceptible host, with a later re–isolation. In his famous publications: Die Äethiologie der Tuberkulose, Koch formulated the criteria, which in strict rigour should be denominated “The postulates of Koch-Henle.”\n    \nLater, Koch embarked on his pivotal studies concerned with the identification of the tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and that of cholera (Vibrio cholerae) in India (see below). In addition, he postulated the principle of specific biological bacterial infection, deducing that each infectious disease was caused by distinct and unique bacteria.\n    \n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">Tuberculin</p>    \n    \nIn spite of Koch's colossal work, it is necessary to mention Koch’s great failure with regards to tuberculosis when, in 1890, he announced that he had encountered an effective remedy to fight the disease called “tuberculin.” \n    \nHowever, a series of clinical studies demonstrated that tuberculin did not act directly against the bacillus, but stimulated the defensive cells of the host, being the base of delayed–type hypersensitivity. \n    \nThis test is still used today to diagnose individuals infected with tuberculosis. Trials began immediately using tuberculin as a therapeutic vaccine, but the results were clearly unsatisfactory. Very few patients were cured, and in some cases tuberculin seemed to facilitate the bacterial dissemination to organs that previously had not been colonized.\n    \nhttp://smallbusiness-solution.com/hekint/the-early-days-of-the-nobel-prize-and-golden-age-of-microbiology/  "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def nonan(x):\n    if type(x) == str:\n        return x.replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n\ntext = ' '.join([nonan(abstract) for abstract in df[\"Current Manufacturers (2017)\"]])\nwordcloud = WordCloud(max_font_size=None,colormap='Set3', background_color='black', collocations=False,\n                      width=1200, height=1000).generate(text)\nfig = px.imshow(wordcloud)\nfig.update_layout(title_text='BCG Manufacturers')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          The Golden Age of Microbiology\n     </h2>\n\n\n\n\nThe Golden Age of Microbiology reached its zenith with the application of these simple postulates.

Between 1890 and 1950, bacterial vaccine development proliferated, including the Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, which is still in use today. \n\n    \nDespite the evidence of health gains from immunisation programmes there has always been resistance to vaccines in some groups. The late 1970s and 1980s marked a period of increasing litigation and decreased profitability for vaccine manufacture, which led to a decline in the number of companies producing vaccines. \n    \n\n<p style=\"color:purple; background-color: #ffccff;\">The Anti-Vaccination Lobby</p>\n    \n    \nThe decline was arrested in part by the implementation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation programme in the US in 1986.

In 1904, a smallpox epidemic was threatening the capital. In the first five months of the year, more than 1,800 people had been hospitalized. A law imposing smallpox vaccination of children had existed since 1837 but had never been put into practice. Therefore, on June 9, 1904, following a proposal by Oswaldo Cruz, the government presented a bill to the Congress requesting the reestablishment of obligatory smallpox vaccination. The extremely rigid and severe provisions of this instrument terrified the people. Popular opposition against Cruz increased sharply and opposition newspapers started a violent campaign against this and the federal government in general. Members of the parliament and labor unions protested. An anti-vaccination league was organized.\n\nOn November 10, the Vaccine Revolt exploded in Rio. Violent confrontations with the police ensued, with strikes, barricades, and shootings in the streets, as the population rose in protest against the government. On November 14, the Military Academy adhered to the revolt, but the cadets where dispersed after an intense shooting. The government declared a state of siege. On November 16, the uprising was controlled and the obligatory vaccination was suspended.\n\nIn 1908, a violent smallpox epidemic made the people rush en masse to the vaccination units. Some 9,000 people died. Cruz was vindicated and his merit recognized.\n\nAmong the international scientific community, his prestige was already uncontested.\n\nIn 1909, he retired from the position as director general for Public Health, dedicating himself exclusively to the Manguinhos Institute, which has been named after him. From the institute he organized important scientific expeditions, which allowed a better knowledge about the health and life conditions in the interior of the country and contributed to the colonization of regions. \n\nCruz eradicated urban yellow fever in the state of Pará. His sanitation campaign in the state of Amazonas allowed concluding the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad, which was interrupted due to the great number of deaths from malaria and yellow fever among the workers.\n\nAs a consequence of the short, fruitful life of Dr. Oswaldo Cruz, an extremely important scientific and health institution was born, which marked the beginning of experimental medicine in Brazil in many areas. To this day it exerts a strong influence on Brazilian science, technology and public health.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldo_Cruz"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text = \" \".join(tweet for tweet in df.BCG)\n\nstopwords = set(STOPWORDS)\n\nwordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords,\n                      background_color=\"black\",\n                      colormap='Pastel1',\n                      width = 1920,\n                      height = 1080).generate(text)\nplt.figure(figsize = (20, 10))\nplt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:#99ffcc\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          COVID-19: Fiocruz’s own vaccine may start clinical trials in 2021\n     </h2>\n    \n    \nWhile gearing up to manufacture the vaccine against COVID-19 developed by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University, Brazil’s Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) has worked on its own vaccine projects which may start human testing in 2021.

Both are in their pre-clinical lab trials, and are likely to start a new animal testing stage known as challenge study.\n\nThe vaccines have been approved in their immunogenicity and toxicity phase in animals, which means they were able to produce an immune response without harming the health of the guinea pigs. In the next stage, scientists will ascertain how vaccinated guinea pigs will respond to exposure to SARS-CoV-2. As it includes the virus in conditions to cause an infection, the test awaited the availability of a high biosecurity laboratory (NB3) and is slated to take place still this month.https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/saude/noticia/2020-11/covid-19-fiocruzs-own-vaccine-may-start-clinical-trials-2021"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Kamal Das https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/what-does-joe-biden-tweet-about\n\ncon_mask=np.array(PIL.Image.open('../input/masks/masks-wordclouds/loc.png'))\n\nwc = WordCloud(max_words=500, mask=con_mask,width=5000,height=2500, colormap='Set2', background_color=\"black\",stopwords=STOPWORDS).generate(text)\nplt.figure( figsize=(30,15))\nplt.imshow(wc)\nplt.axis(\"off\")\nplt.yticks([])\nplt.xticks([])\n#plt.savefig('./biden.png', dpi=50)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<body style=\"background-color:lightblue\">\n     <h2 style=\"color:green; background-color:#99ffcc\">\n          Louis Pasteur\n     </h2>\n\nLouis Pasteur (December 27, 1822 – September 28, 1895)\n    \nPasteur was a French biologist, microbiologist, and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization.\n    \nHe is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases, and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since.

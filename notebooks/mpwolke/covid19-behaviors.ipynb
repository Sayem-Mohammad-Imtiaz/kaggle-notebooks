The need for positive reinforcement to show that the right behavior has desirable consequences.\nhttps://agencia.fapesp.br/in-coping-with-covid-19-human-behavior-can-be-part-of-the-problem-and-part-of-the-solution/34677/ By Karina Toledo"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_face_mask', data = df, palette=\"cool\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_wash_hands', data = df, palette=\"Pastel1\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(133)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_large_gatherings', data = df, palette=\"Greens_r\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nplt.subplot(131)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_avoidance', data = df, palette=\"PuRd\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.subplot(132)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_outside_home', data = df, palette=\"rocket\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.subplot(133)\nsns.countplot(x= 'behavioral_touch_face', data = df, palette=\"rainbow\",edgecolor=\"black\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Plotting pairplot requires Encoding before."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.pairplot(df, x_vars=[\"behavioral_avoidance\", \"behavioral_face_mask\", \"behavioral_wash_hands\", \"behavioral_large_gatherings\", \"behavioral_outside_home\", \"behavioral_touch_face\"], y_vars=\"age_group\", size=7, aspect=0.7, kind=\"reg\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Codes by Aditta Nishad https://www.kaggle.com/adinishad/car-price-prediction-easyway\n\n\nTrain Test Split"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = df.drop('age_group', axis=1)\ny = df[\"age_group\"].copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"model.fit(X_train, y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"predict = model.predict(X_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"predict","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"list(y_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Checking Accuracy"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predict)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mse","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rmse = np.sqrt(mse)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"rmse","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"r2_score(y_test, predict)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#I think it isn't a good result.

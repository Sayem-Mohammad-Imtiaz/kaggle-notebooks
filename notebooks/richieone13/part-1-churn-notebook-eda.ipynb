{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hello, welcome,\n\nthe main motivation is to run various machine learning models to succesfully predict the churn of a customer, whether or not they'll be leaving. The dataset can be found in the [ibm dataset](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/data-science/patterns/predict-customer-churn-using-watson-studio-and-jupyter-notebooks/#)\n\nThe second part of the notebook [Part 2 - Machine Learning Model](https://www.kaggle.com/richieone13/2-churn-notebook-prediction) focused on building various ML models \n\n\n## What dataset are we working with?\n\nThis is a mobile/internet provider dataset which contains the services, customer account info, demographic, whether or not they have left.\n* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.\n* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges\n* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents\n* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn\n\n## First EDA\nUnderstanding the data is paramount and this can be done via EDA, without understanding the data and the relationship with the different variables the ML models will because a black box and it'll be difficult to make improvements and improvevise and maintain. So how can the business trust your model if you can't explain it to the business.\n\nHow can we measure how the ML model can make a impact and measure peformance based on nudging and actually maintaining these customers that are about to churn?\n \n### We should be asking: \"What is the percentage of customers that renew their contract with the business?\"\n\n\n#### Note I have done a quick ML model [Part 2 - Machine Learning Model](https://www.kaggle.com/richieone13/2-churn-notebook-prediction) (in using various models with a 80% accuracy, however the score will be quite high, due to the fact that from the EDA, and data info that churn is only measured last month. So customers on contract are very unlikely to churn. It'll be interesting to determine the churn rate for customers that are only on month to month contract only, we would expect the accruacy to drop. If there is data available for customer that are are about to churn it also would be good to know if they renew their contract.\n\n#### Further analysis from the EDA to improve predicting the ML model, notice that the demographic of age range have very different behaviours - older customers are likely to churn or not stay long on their month-to-month contract. It may be a good idea to create a ML model for different clusters of customers to get a better accuracy score and recall rate."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Training a ML model pipeline (my approah):\n\nThe notebook is a good experiemental environment to try different things out.\n\nThere is a general approach to training a machine learning model which I aim to follow and this is my approach for this dataset.\n\nPart 1 - EDA of the dataset \n* import the files\n* EDA on the dataset\n* treat missing data\n* insight and discovery from the data\n\n[Part 2 - Machine Learning Model](https://www.kaggle.com/richieone13/2-churn-notebook-prediction)\n* selectively choose the features that want to include (select minimum features and scale horizontally - based on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)) this will help with overfitting and peformance in training the model)\n* OPTIONAL - remove the outliers if there are any so the model outliers does not skew the model - maybe using 3 standard deviation, data that is < 1%, data that is > 99%\n* OPTIONAL - shuffling the data to avoid skewness\n* import one hot encoder\n* OPTIONAL - scaling from 0 to 1 (not required rescaling as only concern of the output whether churn or not in the previous month)\n* measure the result via a confusion matrix\n* experiement with different models"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style(\"white\")\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Converting Total Charges to a numerical data type.\ndf.TotalCharges = pd.to_numeric(df.TotalCharges, errors='coerce')\ndf.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Removing missing values \ndf.dropna(inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Great, the data actually now looks quite clean, there are not too many missing values"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Discover and Visualise the Data to gain insights"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the continious value data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndf.hist(bins= 15, figsize=(10,10)) # fig size width & height\n# bins - the higher the more refined.\nplt.show() \n\n# majority of the users are not senior citizen\n# the sample for the tenure are fairly new or have been around quite long 70+\n\n# different scales - feature scaling resolve\n\n# the MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges are tail heavy - shape back to a normal distribution","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# we can do stratified sampling here as we can see the monthly charges is quite a spread in our ML model\n# we do this by categorising the continious variable and grouping.

Any suggestion to improvise would be warmly welcomed.\n### **1. Introduction:**\n[**Coronary artery disease (CAD)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_artery_disease), also known as coronary heart disease (CHD), or simply heart disease, usually involves a reduction in the blood flow due to blockage in the arteries of the heart. The heart disease are usually of the types stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. One of the most common symptom is shooting chest pain which may travel to the left shoulder or the arm. In many cases there are no symptoms of a heart disease but some usual symptoms mat include shortness of breath and emotional stress. Mostly the first sign of a heart disease in not clear until a heart attack.<br>\n    Thus, having a machine learning model to predict the occurance of a heart disease based on various parameters which could detect early heart disease may prove to be quintessential in averting the heart attack.<br>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### *1.1 Importing the Data and important libraries*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport missingno as msno\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Data_heart=pd.read_csv(r'../input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv')\nData_heart_copy=Data_heart.copy()\nData_heart_copy.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Attribute Description\n**age**: age in years<br>\n**sex**: (1 = male; 0 = female)<br>\n**cp**: *chest pain type* (typical angina, atypical angina, non-angina, or asymptomatic angina)<br>\n**trestbps**: *resting blood pressure* (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)<br>\n**chol**: *serum cholestoral* in mg/dl<br>\n**fbs**: *Fasting blood sugar* (< 120 mg/dl or > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)<br>\n**restecg**: *resting electrocardiographic results* (normal, ST-T wave abnormality, or left ventricular hypertrophy)<br>\n**thalach**: *Max. heart rate achieved during thalium stress test*<br>\n**exang**: *Exercise induced angina* (1 = yes; 0 = no)<br>\n**oldpeak**: *ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest*<br>\n**slope**: *Slope of peak exercise ST segment* (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, or 2 = downsloping)<br>\n**ca**: *number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy* 4 = NA<br>\n**thal**: *Thalium stress test result* 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 0 = NA<br>\n**target**: *Heart disease status* 1 or 0 (0 = heart disease 1 = asymptomatic)<br>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### *1.2.

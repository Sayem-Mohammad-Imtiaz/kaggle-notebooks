She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation.\n\nThese questions will guide your analysis:\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2.How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3.How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nYou will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3.Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4.A summary of your analysis\n5.Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis\n\n\n> **Prepare**\nSršen encourages you to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. She points you to a specific data set:\n\n● FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\nSršen tells you that this data set might have some limitations, and encourages you to consider adding another data to help address those limitations as you begin to work more with this data.\nNow, prepare your data for analysis using the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:\n\nGuiding questions \n* Where is your data stored?\n*  How is the data organized? Is it in long or wide format? \n*  Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?\n*  How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?\n*  How did you verify the data’s integrity?\n*  How does it help you answer your question?\n*  Are there any problems with the data?\n\nKey tasks \n1. Download data and store it appropriately.\n2. Identify how it’s organized.\n3. Sort and filter the data.\n4. Determine the credibility of the data.\n\n> **Process**\nThen, process your data for analysis using the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:\n\nGuiding questions \n*  What tools are you choosing and why? \n*  Have you ensured your data’s integrity?\n*  What steps have you taken to ensure that your data is clean? \n*  How can you verify that your data is clean and ready to analyze? \n*  Have you documented your cleaning process so you can review and share those results?\n\nKey tasks\n1. Check the data for errors.\n2. Choose your tools.\n3. Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.\n4. Document the cleaning process.\n5. Proceed to the analyze step.\n\n> **Analyze**\nNow that your data is stored appropriately and has been prepared for analysis, start putting it to work. Use the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:\n\nGuiding questions \n*  How should you organize your data to perform analysis on it? \n*  Has your data been properly formatted? \n*  What surprises did you discover in the data? \n*  What trends or relationships did you find in the data? \n*  How will these insights help answer your business questions?\n\n\nKey tasks \n1. Aggregate your data so it’s useful and accessible. \n2. Organize and format your data.\n3. Perform calculations.\n4. Identify trends and relationships.\n\n> **Share**\nOnce you have completed your analysis, create your data visualizations. The visualizations should clearly communicate your high-level insights and recommendations. Use the following Case Study Roadmap as a guide:\n\nGuiding questions \n* Were you able to answer the business questions? \n* What story does your data tell? \n* How do your findings relate to your original question? \n* Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them? \n* Can data visualization help you share your findings? \n* Is your presentation accessible to your audience?\n\nKey tasks \n1. Determine the best way to share your findings.\n2. Create effective data visualizations.\n3. Present your findings.\n4. Ensure your work is accessible.\n\n> **Act**\nNow that you have finished creating your visualizations, act on your findings.

People walk most on Saturdays closely followed by Tuesdays.\n2. People walk least on Sundays.\n3. The average number of steps is 7645.\n4. Most time is sedentary which we presume they are a working class who do most of their work sitted in an office.\n\n\n> **CALORIES**\n\n1. There is a positive linear correlation between steps and calories.\n2. People burned calories most on Saturdays closely followed by Tuesdays, Monday, Friday and WednesDay.\n3. People burned calories least on Thursdays close followed by Sunday.\n4. There have only two month of data (April and May).\n5. People who walk for burn more calories hence are healthier.\n\n> **SLEEP**\n\n1. Most of the people are fall asleep after getting bed.\n2. People are sleep 7 hours per night on average.","metadata":{}}]}

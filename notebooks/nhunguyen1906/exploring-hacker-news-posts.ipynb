In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.\n\nHacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n\nThe full data set is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), in this project, it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n\n- id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n- title: The title of the post\n- url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n- num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n- num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n- author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n- created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n\nHere are the first few rows of the data set:\n\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr style='height:43.5pt'>\n   <td>id\n   </td>\n   <td>title\n   </td>\n   <td>url\n   </td>\n   <td>num_points\n   </td>\n   <td>num_comments\n   </td>\n   <td>author\n   </td>\n   <td>created_at\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n <tr>\n  <td>12224879</td>\n  <td>Interactive Dynamic Video</td>\n  <td>http://www.interactivedynamicvideo.com/</td>\n  <td>386</td>\n  <td>52</td>\n  <td>ne0phyte</td>\n  <td>8/4/2016 11:52</td>\n </tr>\n  <tr>\n  <td>10975351</td>\n  <td>How to Use Open Source and Shut the F*ck Up at the Same Time</td>\n  <td>http://hueniverse.com/2016/01/26/how-to-use-open-source-and-shut-the-fuck-up-at-the-same-time/</td>\n  <td>39</td>\n  <td>10</td>\n  <td>josep2</td>\n  <td>1/26/2016 19:30</td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Loading","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from csv import reader\nimport datetime as dt","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def read_csv_file(filename):\n    opened_file = open(filename)\n    file_content = reader(opened_file)\n    lst = list(file_content)\n    opened_file.close()\n    \n    return lst[0], lst[1:]\n\ndef display_table(dataset, start, end, information=False):\n    ds = dataset[start:end]\n    for row in ds:\n        print(row)\n        print('\\n') # adds a new (empty) line after each row\n        \n    if (information == True):\n        print('Number of rows:', len(ds))\n        print('Number of columns:', len(ds[0]))            ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"headers, hn = read_csv_file(\"/kaggle/input/hacker-news-posts/HN_posts_year_to_Sep_26_2016.csv\")\nprint(headers)\nprint(\"\\n\")\ndisplay_table(hn, 0, 5, True)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ask_posts = []\nshow_posts = []\nother_posts = []\n\nfor row in hn:\n    title = row[1]\n    title = title.lower()\n    if (title.startswith(\"ask hn\")):\n        ask_posts.append(row)\n    elif (title.startswith(\"show hn\")):\n        show_posts.append(row)\n    else:\n        other_posts.append(row)\n        \nprint(len(ask_posts))\nprint(len(show_posts))\nprint(len(other_posts))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ask_posts[:5]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"show_posts[:5]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def avg_comments(posts):\n    total_comments = 0\n    \n    for row in posts:\n        num_comments = int(row[4])\n        total_comments += num_comments\n\n    avg_comments = total_comments/len(posts)\n\n    return avg_comments","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"avg_ask_comments = avg_comments(ask_posts)\navg_show_comments = avg_comments(show_posts)\nprint(\"The average comment of ask posts is {:.2f}\".format(avg_ask_comments))\nprint(\"The average comment of show posts is {:.2f}\".format(avg_show_comments))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since ask posts are more likely to receive comments, we'll focus our remaining analysis just on these posts.\n\nNext, we'll determine if ask posts created at a certain time are more likely to attract comments.

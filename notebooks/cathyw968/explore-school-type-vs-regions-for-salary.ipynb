1. Engineering schools leads to the highest salarys across all regions, specifically in California (The mean salary starts around 73000 and 10 years later, Engineering mean salary reach around 123000 in California, so even Ivy League salary has the biggest increase in 10 years, It is not catch up the Engineering's salary yet)\n   2. Liberal Arts and Party schools shows pretty good increase after 10 years, Liberal Arts performs pretty good in Southern area (the mean of mid-career salary is around 97000, higher than Engineering's salary in that area), but It is relative weak in Western (The mean starting salary is only around 40000, and 10 years only increase to around 75000).\n   3. State schools show the lower starting salary and  mid-career salary across almost every region\n   4. Ivy League education has the strongest increase potential in a career (The mean of starting salary is around 60000, and after 10 years, the mean of mid-career salary increase to around 120000)\n   5.

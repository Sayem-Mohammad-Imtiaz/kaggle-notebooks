We immediately recognize that we have a skewness in the data and in the scatterplot we also see some outliers. Let's take a closer look at this\n\n### Skewness & Kurtosis\nFirst we look at the skewness. On the plot we can already see that we have to do with left-skewed data. A look at the values confirms this. If we look at the kurtosis we also see that it deviates strongly from the normal distribution, which is also confirmed by the values. However, it should be noted that real data is never completely normally distributed and the values are within a normal tolerance range. However, we can try to normalize them a bit. Especially since we have some outliers, the distance of the outliers can bring us closer to a normal distribution.\n\n### Outliers\nIn addition to the scatterplot, we also look at a boxplot for the three variables in order to be able to recognize outliers. The box plot also confirms our assumption. We remove the outliers using the interquantile distance between the 1st and 3rd quantiles. This is a frequently used method.\n\n### Results\nAs you can see, there are no more outliers on the box plots. Also, the values for skewness and kurtosis have improved.

If we take out the scores, however, the accuracy of the model deteriorates.\n\n### Dummy Variable\nNow we simplify the problem and let only the model predict whether the student is good or bad. To do this, we create a dummy variable that matches the division using the median.

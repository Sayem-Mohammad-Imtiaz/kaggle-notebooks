A syndrome is a group of symptoms that doesn’t have a definitive diagnosis. Dementia is a group of symptoms that affects mental cognitive tasks such as memory and reasoning. Dementia is an umbrella term that Alzheimer’s disease can fall under. It can occur due to a variety of conditions, the most common of which is Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n**Dementia** is the term applied to a group of symptoms that negatively impact memory, but **Alzheimer’s** is a progressive disease of the brain that slowly causes impairment in memory and cognitive function. The exact cause is unknown and no cure is available.\n\nThe **World Health Organization** Trusted Source says that **47.5 million** people around the world are living with dementia.\n\nThe **National Institutes of Health** estimate that more than 5 million people in the United States have Alzheimer’s disease. Although younger people can and do get Alzheimer’s, the symptoms generally begin after age 60.\n\nThe time from diagnosis to death can be as little as three years in people over 80 years old. However, it can be much longer for younger people.\n\nDamage to the brain begins years before symptoms appear. Abnormal protein deposits form plaques and tangles in the brain of someone with Alzheimer’s disease. Connections between cells are lost, and they begin to die. In advanced cases, the brain shows significant shrinkage.\n\nIt’s impossible to diagnose Alzheimer’s with complete accuracy while a person is alive. The diagnosis can only be confirmed when the brain is examined under a microscope during an autopsy.\n\n### Alzheimer’s vs. Dementia symptoms\n\nThe symptoms of **Alzheimer’s** and **dementia** can overlap, but there can be some differences.\n\nBoth conditions can cause:\n\n* a decline in the ability to think\n* memory impairment\n* communication impairment\n\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s include:\n\n* difficulty remembering recent events or conversations\n* apathy\n* depression\n* impaired judgment\n* disorientation\n* confusion\n* behavioral changes\n* difficulty speaking, swallowing, or walking in advanced stages of the disease\n\nReference: [Healthline.com](https://www.healthline.com/health/alzheimers-disease/difference-dementia-alzheimers#dementia)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Statement\nAs the population of the world increases, there will be larger numbers of people with dementia and an emerging need for prompt diagnosis and treatment. But an accurate early, or timely, diagnosis of dementia with the use of daat analysis with close coordination with medical fraternity can help people access to treatments that can improve symptoms and slow down the progress of the disease, can\naccess to advice and support, have time to prepare for the future and plan ahead.\n\nSo, early detection of dementia is very crucial and it is the need of the hour.\n\n## Data Understanding\nThis dataset of a **Cross-sectional MRI Data** and **Longitudinal MRI data**.Cross-sectional data is a collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, a reliability data set is included containing 20 nondemented subjects imaged on a subsequent visit within 90 days of their initial session.\n\nLongitudinal data is a collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.\n\nAs I am working on only longitudinal data in this kernel so lets check out the attributes of longitudinal data\n\n### Attributes:\nIt consists of 15 attributes which are describes as follows :\n\n- **Subject.ID** - Unique Id of the patient\n- **MRI.ID** - Unique Id generated after conducting MRI on patient\n- **Group** - It is a group of Converted (Previously Normal but developed dimentia later),  Demented and  Nondemented (Normal Pateints)\n- **Visit** - Number of visit to detect dementia status\n- **MR.Delay** - Not Known\n\n**Demographics Info**\n\n- **M.F** - Gender\n- **Hand** - Handedness (actually all subjects were right-handed so I will drop this column)\n- **Age** - Age in years\n- **EDUC** - Years of education\n- **SES** - Socioeconomic status as assessed by the Hollingshead Index of Social Position and classified into categories from 1 (highest status) to 5 (lowest status)\n\n**Clinical Info**\n\n- **MMSE** - Mini-Mental State Examination score (range is from 0 = worst to 30 = best)\n- **CDR** - Clinical Dementia Rating (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = very mild AD, 1 = mild AD, 2 = moderate AD)\n\n**Derived anatomic volumes**\n\n- **eTIV** - Estimated total intracranial volume, mm3\n- **nWBV** - Normalized whole-brain volume, expressed as a percent of all voxels in the atlas-masked image that are labeled as gray or white matter by the automated tissue segmentation process\n- **ASF** - Atlas scaling factor (unitless). Computed scaling factor that transforms native-space brain and skull to the atlas target (i.e., the determinant of the transform matrix)\n\n## Analysis Approach\nMy analysis approach is divided into following steps:\n\n**1.

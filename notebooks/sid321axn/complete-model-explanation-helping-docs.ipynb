Good data-driven systems for predicting heart disease can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives.\n\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a good resource for information about heart disease. According to their [website](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm):\n\n* About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year–that’s 1 in every 4 deaths.\n* Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men.\n* Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.\n* Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.\n* Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For American Indians or Alaska Natives and Asians or Pacific Islanders, heart disease is second only to cancer.\n\nFor more information, you can look at the [website](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/prevention.htm) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: "},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bf7b14e87cdfd2bac32a1cd73d39f8aca2edfc53"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('BLw62AhW_Kc', width=700, height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0d0a2c6b986e9c2e091028d4d07a7dfae7d4472a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.ibb.co/ypG4Cq3/CVD-infographic-1.jpg)\n\n# About dataset\n\nThe dataset contains the following features:\n1. **age(in years)**\n2. **sex:** (1 = male;

SHAP has c++ implementations supporting XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and scikit-learn tree models.\n\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. Typically, SHAP values try to explain the output of a model (function) as a sum of the effects of each feature being introduced into a conditional expectation. Importantly, for non-linear functions the order in which features are introduced matters. The SHAP values result from averaging over all possible orderings. Proofs from game theory show this is the only possible consistent approach.\n\nAn intuitive way to understand the Shapley value is the following: The feature values enter a room in random order.

LIME\n\n**Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)**. The overall goal of LIME is to identify an interpretable model over the interpretable representation that is locally faithful to the classifier.\n\nThe local explanation method LIME interprets an individual prediction by learning an interpretable model locally. The intuition behind LIME is that it samples instances both in the vicinity and far away from the interpretable representation of the original input. Then LIME takes the interpretable representation of these sample points, determines their predictions and builds a weighted linear model by minimizing the loss and complexity. The samples weighting is based on their distances from the original point. The points weights decrease as the points get farther away. The explanation is locally faithful, which means it represents the model prediction of vicinity instances.This is illustrated in below figure.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/9Hxnb5g/lime1.png)\n\nBy explaining a prediction\", we mean presenting textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance’s components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model’s prediction. We argue that explaining predictions is an important aspect in getting humans to trust and use machine learning effectively, if the explanations are faithful and intelligible.\nThe process of explaining individual predictions is illustrated in Figure 1. It is clear that a doctor is much better positioned to make a decision with the help of a model if\nintelligible explanations are provided. In this case, an explanation is a small list of symptoms with relative weights {symptoms that either contribute to the prediction (in green) or are evidence against it (in red).

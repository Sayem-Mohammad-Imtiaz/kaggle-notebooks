Total health spending per capita is significanly different between countries in Africa and Europe.\n1. The average number of years a new born child would live (if the current mortality patterns are to remain the same) is significanly different between countries in Africa and Europe.\n1. Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births is significanly different between countries in Africa and Europe.\n1. Death of children under 5 years of age per 1000 live births is significanly different between countries in North America and South America.\n1.

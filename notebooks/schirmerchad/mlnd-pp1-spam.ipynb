Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.\nIn this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify <a href = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection'> SMS messages </a> as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to do that for us!\nBeing able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"46c2205b-6387-87c9-36bc-698827e872a0"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c4a13dd7-e765-c046-9f2d-b9239d368665"},"outputs":[],"source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/spam.csv',\n                   encoding = 'ISO-8859-1')\ndf = df.ix[:, [0, 1]]\ndf.rename(columns={'v2':'sms_message', 'v1':'label'}, inplace=True)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f5e783f0-ef64-9866-ba4f-01a70f404646"},"outputs":[],"source":"df['label'] = df.label.map({'ham':0,'spam':1})\ndf.head()"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"15e6826f-b1a4-7e43-e460-f635f9ebcb7a"},"outputs":[],"source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['sms_message'], df['label'], random_state=1)\n\nprint('Number of rows in the total set: {}'.format(df.shape[0]))\nprint('Number of rows in the training set: {}'.format(X_train.shape[0]))\nprint('Number of rows in the test set: {}'.format(X_test.shape[0]))"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"24b6914d-ff37-22f2-a50e-9e3cd04f018e"},"outputs":[],"source":"count_vector = CountVectorizer()\ntraining_data = count_vector.fit_transform(X_train)\ntesting_data = count_vector.transform(X_test)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3e30a6be-68d5-22dc-14d1-16d8c4ba66f5"},"outputs":[],"source":"naive_bayes = MultinomialNB()\nnaive_bayes.fit(training_data, y_train)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8b13309f-3243-8336-5ec4-82f6ca47c31a"},"outputs":[],"source":"predictions = naive_bayes.predict(testing_data)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8ec70d30-a328-76d1-d22a-05c385be3df9"},"outputs":[],"source":"print('Accuracy score: ', format(accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('Precision score: ', format(precision_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('Recall score: ', format(recall_score(y_test, predictions)))\nprint('F1 score: ', format(f1_score(y_test, predictions)))"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

Actually **only ~5% of trades have matching import/export values**. So i was thinking:'Is it possible that missing values are unevenly distributed among the three appendices?' Remember that animals from appendix I are most endangered and therefore, illegal trade might be more lucrative. So let's plot it. My idea was to compute the normalized trade amounts of all appendices and subtract the normalized amount of trades where import and export quantities match. The plot clearly shows **~6% less unknown traded quantities for App. I animals** which seems good. It looks like animal trades for highly endangered species are more carefully looked at. On the other hand, App. II and III seem to have more trades of unilaterally known amounts, but it kind of has to be this way, since we are subtracting normalized values, that sum up to 1. This means the sum of all differences must always be 0. Is this skewing the analysis?

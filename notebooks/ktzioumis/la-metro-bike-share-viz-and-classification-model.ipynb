{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction \n\nThis dataset is a catalogue of rides taken on the LA-Metro Bike Share Network.\n\n\"The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, Port of LA and the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.\"\n<br>-https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/\n\nBike sharing netowrks have been established in cities of all sizes, they allow residents and visitors a fun, cheap, fast and  easy way to explore the city they are based in and have even become part of regular commuter routines. Although a bicycle is in itself a low-tech transport option, technology has and will continue to play major role in the rapid expansion of bike sharing networks. The bike may be dumb (and they increasingly aren't) but the network itself is very smart.\n\n\"Now companies have GPS sensors to track their bikes, and smartphones, credit cards, or transit passes to know who has themâ€”and whom to penalize if the wheels go missing. Riders, meanwhile, can use apps to track down available rides or bike-share stations when they need them.\"\n<br>-Wired Magazine (https://www.wired.com/story/americans-falling-in-love-bike-share/)\n\nAnd data collection and analysis and with it machine learning is the key to building a bike network that really works. Data can provide many insights and much guidance about a bike sharing network and through this exploration of the LA-Metro Bike Network I hope to demonstrate just some of this potential.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ## Load Data and Basic Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/metro-bike-share-trip-data.csv')\ndf.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Feature descriptions from https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/\n\n<b>trip_id:</b> Locally unique integer that identifies the trip\n\n<b>duration:</b> Length of trip in <i> minutes*</i>\n\n<b>start_time:</b> The date/time when the trip began, presented in ISO 8601 format in local time\n\n<b>end_time: </b>The date/time when the trip ended, presented in ISO 8601 format in local time\n\n<b>start_station:</b> The station ID where the trip originated \n\n<b>start_lat:</b> The latitude of the station where the trip originated\n\n<b>start_lon: </b>The longitude of the station where the trip originated\n\n<b>end_station: </b>The station ID where the trip terminated \n\n<b>end_lat: </b>The latitude of the station where the trip terminated\n\n<b>end_lon: </b>The longitude of the station where the trip terminated\n\n<b>bike_id: </b> Locally unique integer that identifies the bike\n    \n<b>plan_duration: </b>The number of days that the plan the passholder is using entitles them to ride; 0 is used for a single ride plan (Walk-up)\n\n<b>trip_route_category:</b> \"Round Trip\" for trips starting and ending at the same station or \"One Way\" for all other trips\n\n<b>passholder_type: </b>The name of the passholder's plan\n\n*units are actually in but each instance is a multiple of 60 i.e. a whole minute number.

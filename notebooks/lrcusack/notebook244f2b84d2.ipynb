Some pokemon have one type, some have two. I think the way to handle this is to reduce it to one type. For pokemon with one type already, nothing will change; for pokemon with two types, there will be three entries in the new pokemon table. One that has the first type, one that has the second type, and one that has the two types appended. For example, Bulbasaur (grass, poison), would become [Bulbasaur (grass), Bulbasaur(poison), Bulbasaur (grasspoison). I will assume that type order (i.e. Type 1 before Type 2) DOES matter, so for example grasspoison (from Type 1 grass, Type 2 poison) will be treated as a different type than poisongrass (from Type 1 poison, type 2 grass).

I need to confirm that each of the methods use the same scoring function, or at least have comparable results.\n\nOverall, the accuracy for all the classifiers on the test set is in around 70 (with the exception of the abysmal score of the Naive Bayes Classifier). This isn't great, but my training/test procedure is flawed and my scoring function isn't completely fair. When I split up the Pokemons' types, I made it so that the training set could have Bulbasaur as a poison pokemon and the test set could have Bulbasaur as a grass pokemon. When I score the classifier, it will \"correctly\" classify as poison, and be scored incorrect because it was not grass. \n\nReally, the test/training sets should be separated on actual pokemon, but that presents a problem for training. I need to make sure all types are represented in my training set and in my test set. Ideally, my scoring function should also call the classifier correct whether it classifies Bulbasaur as grass, poison, or both. \n\nFinally, these classifiers can be improved by tweaking their input parameters, so there is still plenty of work to do improving my results"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

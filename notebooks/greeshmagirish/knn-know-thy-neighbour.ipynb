K-Nearest Neighbours is a type of supervised machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification or regression, but commonly used in classification. \nTo make a prediction, the KNN algorithm doesn’t calculate a predictive model from a training dataset like in logistic or linear regression. Take a moment and let that sink in!\n\n*In KNN, there is no actual learning phase*\n\nOne of reasons why its also known as the lazy learner algorithm.\n\n**Then how does KNN make a prediction?**\n\nIt uses the entire dataset and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. That means when an observation that isn’t part of the dataset, the algorithm will look for the K instances of the data points closest to our observation. Then for these K instances or neighbors, the algorithm will use their output in order to make the prediction.\n\n**How does it work in case of regression and classification?**\n\nIf KNN is used for a regression problem, the mean (or median) of the target variables of the K closest observations will be used for predictions. \nIf KNN is used for a classification problem, it’s the mode of the target class of the K closest observations that will be used for predictions.\n\n![KNNImage](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/k-nearest-neighbor-algorithm-for-machine-learning2.png)\n\nAnd now, you know how KNN works! You've mastered another supervised machine learning algorithm!\nUh, no, not yet... there's more to know, hang on for a bit, yeah?\n\nSo far we've understood how KNN is supposed to work. Let's now understand the component that go into the algorithm,\n\n* Calculating Similarity - what facets do I consider while telling A is similar to B? \n* K i.e., how many neighbours should I look at for similarities before I make a prediction?\n\n\n### Calculating Similarity:\n\nSimilarity is calculating the distance between the point we know and the point we want to classify. Hence, in KNN, we will calculate the distance of the test point from all the observations of the training dataset and then find K nearest neighbors of it. This will for every test point and that is how it finds similarities in the data. \nTo ensure we extract most of KNN, we need to make sure the distance metric provided to KNN is the right one. \n\nThis [medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/importance-of-distance-metrics-in-machine-learning-modelling-e51395ffe60d) nicely explains the various distance metrics available and this paper - [Effects of Distance Measure Choice on KNN Classifier Performance - A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04321.pdf) explains how the choice of the distance metric can affect the model's performance. \n\nIn this notebook, we're going to understand the components using sklearn's library. Hence, we'll look at how the selecting the right distance metric affects the model's performance metric.\n\n### K:\n\nThis is an important paramemer and hence it needs to be chosen carefully. To select the value of K that suits your data, we run the KNN algorithm multiple times with different values of K. After this, we choose the K that reduces the number of errors encountered while maintaining the ability of the algorithm to make correct predictions when it receives new data.\n\nHere's where things get tricky:\n\nDecreasing the value of K makes our predictions become less stable. Why do we say that? Consider K = 1. KNN is a discriminative algorithm since it models the conditional probability of a sample belonging to a given class. And with 1 neighbour you estimate your probability of the test point based on a single sample: your closest neighbor. This is very sensitive to all sort of distortions like noise, outliers, mislabelling of data, and so on.\n\nConversely, as we increase the value of K, our predictions become more and more stable due to majority or average voting. We are therefore more likely to make correct predictions (up to a certain point) but with increasing K, we’re starting to see an increasing number of errors. It’s at this point that we know that we’ve pushed the value of K too far.\n\nHence its necessary to make sure we pick the right value for K keeping the errors in check. In the notebook, we'll see how to check the erros at various values for K and pick the one that's best.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn import metrics","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.799689Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.800281Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.804866Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.800228Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.804085Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/bank-marketing/bank-additional-full.csv', delimiter=';')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.806131Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.806602Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.959202Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.806559Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-08T11:36:45.958337Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The purpose of this notebook is to understand KNN.

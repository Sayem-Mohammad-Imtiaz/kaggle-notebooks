This notebook is solely  EDA with a lot of theory. I find EDA to be one of the most interesting ways of understanding any domain. \nI am no expert in Economics, but with my limited understanding and ofcourse with all the help on the internet, I'll be exploring the features given in the dataset and if and whether they help in our understanding of the happenings/warning signs of foreseeing a banking crisis or any financial crisis in a country.\n\nAt the end of the notebook are the resources I've taken information on. \nHope this helps!

When currencies fluctuate wildly, they can create economic uncertainty and instability, affecting capital flows and international trade. The value of the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market is an important instrument in a central bank’s toolkit, as well as a key consideration when it sets monetary policy. Directly or indirectly, currency levels affect a number of key economic variables.\n\nKeeping this in mind, let's visualize the exchange rate of the country vis-a-vis the USD .

It is debt issued by the national government in a foreign currency in order to finance the issuing country's growth and development.\n\nSovereign debt is usually created by borrowing government bonds and bills and issuing securities. Countries that are less creditworthy compared to others directly borrow from world organizations like The World Bank and other international financial institutions. An unfavorable change in exchange rates and an overly optimistic valuation of the payback from the projects financed by the debt can make it difficult for countries to repay sovereign debt.\n\nThe most important risk in sovereign debt is the risk of default by the issuing country.

After that, it was only around the begining of 1990, we see that a banking crisis, eventually lead the country to default again. Similarly, for Zimbabwe the country was already facing a banking crisis which eventually led it to default on domestic debts.\n\n## Sovereign External Debt Default\n\nExternal debt is the portion of a country's debt that was borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. To earn the needed currency, the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lender's country.\n\nA debt crisis can occur if a country with a weak economy is not able to repay the external debt due to the inability to produce and sell goods and make a profitable return. \n\nIf a nation is unable or refuses to repay its external debt, it is said to be in a sovereign default. This can lead to the lenders withholding future releases of assets that might be needed by the borrowing nation. Such instances can have a rolling effect, wherein the borrower’s currency collapses and that nation’s overall economic growth is stalled."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,10))\nsns.countplot(data_df['country'],hue=data_df['sovereign_external_debt_default'],ax=ax)\nplt.xlabel('Countries')\nplt.ylabel('Counts')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sovereign_ext = data_df[['year','country', 'sovereign_external_debt_default', 'exch_usd', 'banking_crisis']]\nsovereign_ext = sovereign_ext[(sovereign_ext['country'] == 'Central African Republic') | (sovereign_ext['country'] == 'Ivory Coast') | (sovereign_ext['country']=='Zimbabwe') ]\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,15))\ncount = 1\n\nfor country in sovereign_ext.country.unique():\n    plt.subplot(len(sovereign_ext.country.unique()),1,count)\n    subset = sovereign_ext[(sovereign_ext['country'] == country)]\n    sns.lineplot(subset['year'],subset['sovereign_external_debt_default'],ci=None)\n    plt.scatter(subset['year'],subset[\"banking_crisis\"], color='coral', label='Banking Crisis')\n    plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.6)\n    plt.xlabel('Years')\n    plt.ylabel('Sovereign Ext Debt Defaults/Banking Crisis')\n    plt.title(country)\n    count+=1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This shows that the three countries default on external debt, despite not having a banking crisis as a premise.

It is the devaluation in a nation's currency matched by volatile markets and a lack of faith in the nation's economy. A currency crisis is sometimes predictable and is often sudden. It may be precipitated by governments, investors, central banks, or any combination of actors.

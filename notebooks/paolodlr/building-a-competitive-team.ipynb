Now that the last slot of my Pokémon team is filled, the team is complete.\n\nHowever, I feel like there are some things I need to learn more about  what this team is capable of. For starters, who do I run first when I am matched up with a team filled with certain types that I am strong against, weak against, and there are teams where in they outspeed my team, or have a high defensive stat.\n\nHow should I tackle the rotations of my team in going up against these certain types?\n\nLet's first look at the **stats of every Pokémon** available.

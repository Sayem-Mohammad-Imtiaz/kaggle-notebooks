Some employees leave the company as they reach their retirement age while some leave due to many factors but not limited to lower satisfaction rate, lower pay rate, and toxic work environment. Measuring attrition can uncover many answers related to the functioning within the organisation. Higher attrition rates signal a need for further investigation.\n\nThe dataset used to examine the trends related to Employee Attrition is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists. Using Python and its frameworks, we would try to uncover factors that might be related to the attrition levels among the employees.\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the necessary libraries.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Some columns have same values and are purely redundant in this case.

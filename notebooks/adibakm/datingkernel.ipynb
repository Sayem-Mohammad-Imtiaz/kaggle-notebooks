This dataset was like a gift from the heavens and it's time for me to do some data analysis !\n\n**Here are some questions that I will be seeking answers to**\n* What is the ideal male or female like\n* Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?\n* Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?\n### Table of Contents\n 1.

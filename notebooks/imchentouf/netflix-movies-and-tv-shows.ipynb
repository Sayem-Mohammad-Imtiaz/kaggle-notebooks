Netflix is increasing her focusing on Movies rather than TV SHOW in the recent years, speacilally in 2020.\n            1.1.   Most people watch movies with notion of watching an actor/director's work they like.\n            1.2.   Most of people dosen't have time to watch a serie countiously so they prefer \n            watch a movie because \n            it will take just about 90 min. \n    2.   Netflix try to increase More and More her TV Shows rather Than Movies.\n            2.1.   This could be because the people who are the most excited about particular \n            movies will have \n            seen them in the cinema before they become available on Netflix, meaning that \n            they have less incentive \n            to check them out on Netflix when the chance comes up.\n            2.2.   TV shows tend to be less expensive to make than movies, meaning that Netflix \n            can afford \n            to make not just more of them but also make a wide range of them. \n            2.3.

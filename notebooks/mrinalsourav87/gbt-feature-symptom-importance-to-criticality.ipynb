correlate with criticality is similar (differing only by small magnitudes) \n\nThe order of importance is: \n\n<ul>\n    <li> Age -  Older people are at a higher risk. Please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/jeffreybraun/identifying-susceptible-pop-of-covid-19-fatality\">refer to this </a> for the exact correlation. </li>\n    <li> Pneumonia -  People diagnosed with pneumonia come second in criticality. </li>\n    <li> RENAL_CHRONIC - identifies if the patient has a diagnosis of chronic kidney failure. </li> \n    <li> Sex or Gender - with Male being more susceptible than female. (refer to the same kernel above) </li> \n    <li> Diabetes -   Identifies if the patient has a diagnosis of diabetes. </li>\n    <li> hypertension -  Identifies if the patient has a diagnosis of hypertension.</li> \n    <li> Obesity </li>\n    <li> Other Disease </li>\n    <li> 'inmsupr' -   Identifies if the patient has immunosuppression. </li>\n    <li> Cardiovascular disease </li>\n    <li> COPD </li> \n    <li> Asthma - This goes against common intuition; perhaps more data is required for further clarifucation </li>\n    <li> Tobacco - This too may seem counterintuitive but there is <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/smoking-and-covid-19\"> no established study </a> that clearly identifies the correlation between smoking/tobacco consumption and Covid19 severity yet. </li>\n    <li> Pregnancy - I would be skeptical about this result too but <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/03/novel-coronavirus-2019\"> here's </a> more about pregnancy and Covid19. </li>\n   </ul>\n\n<br>\n\n<h2> Important Notes </h2> \n    \nThese results come from only 67300 records filtered from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx/covid19-patient-precondition-dataset\"> here </a>, which has been sampled from Mexico. <br> \nSome \"symptoms\" like Pregnancy and Asthma could be undersampled in the data. Pregnancy also has this added complexity in that it is highly dependent on Gender; it's entropy/gini_index should be calculated conditioned on the Gender==Female group instead of how it has been done here in isolation.  \n\nI am not a doctor and have nothing to do with any Medical Fraternity from any country. As is true with most data science results and models, the larger the number of records the more accurate the predictions get. The data here is low cardinal (True/False) and low dimensional (14 symptoms). As such, the GBT model should be doing what it does best; yet the results should not be taken as concrete and robust, until data from more sources could corraborate the same. <br>\nPlease feel free to let me know if I am missing anything. <br>\n\nLastly, big shout out to <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx\"> Tanmay Mukherjee </a> for finding the data and posting it to Kaggle.

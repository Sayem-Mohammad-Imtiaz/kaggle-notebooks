While many companies put an emphasis on the costly process of hiring and recruiting, there isn’t enough attention invested in solving the issues that cause top talent to leave. Although compensation is the most commonly associated reason behind attrition, let's make an analysis to see if this is really one of the most important motives ¡¡¡\n\nUnderstanding the motivations behind employee attrition is the essential first step in understanding the problem and properly addressing it before substantial, long-lasting damage is caused to your organization. Thankfully, with this EDA we will be able to provide employers the actionable insights they need to better understand their employees and make any necessary changes before turnover rates swell, productivity drops, and the entire company’s future is suddenly less bright."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What does employee attrition mean?\nThe attrition rate is a calculation of the number of individuals that leave or move out of a business over a specified time frame.\n\n### What is the difference between employee turnover and attrition?\nBoth terms are used when an employee leaves a company but with a difference in processes, such as discharge, termination, or resignation. Attrition occurs when an employee retires or when the employer terminates the job position. When employee turnover occurs, the employers look for a replacement.\n\n### What is a good employee attrition rate?\nA good, average turnover rate is around 10%.\n\n### What are some effective methods to reduce a high attrition rate?\n* Recruit and hire the right people.\n* Offer benefits and compensation.\n* Offer flexibility.\n* Pay attention to employee engagement.\n* Recognize and reward employees."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Well, let's get down to work then, let's see what's going on at IBM!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\n\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\nsns.set_style(\"white\")\nrcParams['figure.figsize'] = 6,4\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\n\nimport os\nfrom IPython.display import Image\nimport warnings    # We want to suppress warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")    # Ignore warnings","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv\")\ndf.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Do we have null values ?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nnull = df.isnull().sum() \nnull[null > 0] # Noo, fortunately there are none","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's convert our output variable from categorical to numerical"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y_dict = {\"Yes\":1,\"No\":0}\ndf[\"Attrition_numeric\"] = df[\"Attrition\"].map(y_dict)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These columns are of no use to us, throw them away!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(['EmployeeCount', 'EmployeeNumber', 'Over18', 'StandardHours',\"Attrition\"], axis=\"columns\", inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's make a quick summary of the variables and see what we find ¡"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#describe\ndf.describe().T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The average age is 36 years, there are very young people with 18 years (young trainees or interns?) and people with 60 years (managers with many years of work?).\n* There are people who live very close to work, almost next door, and others are almost an hour's drive away!\n* Salaries are a world of their own!

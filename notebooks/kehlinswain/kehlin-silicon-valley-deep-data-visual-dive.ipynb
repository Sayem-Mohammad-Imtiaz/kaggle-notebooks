Women not only are hired in lower numbers than men are; they also leave tech at more than twice the rate men do. It’s not hard to see why. Studies show that women who work in tech are interrupted in meetings more often than men. They are evaluated on their personality in a way that men are not. They are less likely to get funding from venture capitalists, who, studies also show, find pitches delivered by men—especially handsome men—more persuasive. And in a particularly cruel irony, women’s contributions to open-source software are accepted more often than men’s are, but only if their gender is unknown.\n\nIn short there are social issues in the world of technology, and I intend to address the gender gap issue by exploring the top 23 silicon valley gender data sets during 2016. \n\n\n\n## **The Data** \n\nThere are six columns in this dataset:\n\n**company:** Company name\n\n**year:** For now, 2016 only\n\n**race:** Possible values: \"American_Indian_Alaskan_Native\", \"Asian\", \"Black_or_African_American\", \"Latino\", \"Native_Hawaiian_or_Pacific_Islander\", \"Two_or_more_races\", \"White\", \"Overall_totals\"\n\n**gender:** Possible values: \"male\", \"female\". Non-binary gender is not counted in EEO-1 reports.\n\n**job_category:** Possible values: \"Administrative support\", \"Craft workers\", \"Executive/Senior officials & Mgrs\", \"First/Mid officials & Mgrs\", \"laborers and helpers\", \"operatives\", \"Professionals\", \"Sales workers\", \"Service workers\", \"Technicians\", \"Previous_totals\", \"Totals\"\n\n**count:** Mostly integer values, but contains \"na\" for a no-data variable.\n\n## Plotly and SNS Visulizations\n\nThis will also be a crash course using one of the emerging data visualation libraries [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

One of the difficult part peices to read in this data graph is what are the proportions between the two companies? \n\n## Discussion\n<h3><b> We can see that some of the biggest companies such as Intel, Apple, Cisco, Google have a huge gap between the number of male and female employees. Let us dig a little deeper to see how wide the gap is between female and male employees by exploring the ratio of males and females at each company. So we can see the data by reducing the bias of the total employee count.</b></h3>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"83cd06fe7439f8c87a9982ae306c9327ac0d60ec","_cell_guid":"2c9b6542-0d6c-4938-92b9-6e45989c5468"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 7 | Male to Female Ratios Calculation\n* Count the sum of the genders from gender data frame \n* Call the [unstack function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.unstack.html) on the d dataframe to pivot the table based on column names\n* Leverage lambda to find the percentages of males and females for the Silicon Valley Companies to create a quick sum and averaging function\n* Sort the ratio data in our data in a smallest to greatest (descending order)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"582c124a97e4140135d042ca62375929153c1969","_cell_guid":"87a2d8ba-bd99-4f0d-a96a-b6917d2c9c0c","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d=gender_data.groupby(['company','gender']).agg({'count':sum})\nd=d.unstack()\nd=d['count']\nd=np.round(d.iloc[:,:].apply(lambda x: (x/x.sum())*100,axis=1))\nd['Ratio']=np.round(d['male']/d['female'],2)\nd.sort_values(by='Ratio',inplace=True,ascending=False)\nd.columns=['Female %','Male %','Ratio']","execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"31d75b02efc24b94f1b094dc28c26e38081ecb33","_cell_guid":"8a16904a-9393-48d5-9814-efb14374108d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d","execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bd48dd07d4fc3af912d589283b4b4d8117261446","_cell_guid":"274dcec1-fd1a-40b7-927f-76028cbb2f69"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Even big companies such as <b>Nvidia, Intel, Cisco, Uber, Google, Apple, Facebook </b> and many more have more than <b>2 male employees for each female employee.</b>\n#### <b>Nvidia</b> seems to have the largest female to male ratio out of all the 23 silicon valley companies  <b>with almost 5 men for each female employee</b>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1a0f0ead348fa53e88ced740006dd59b8f4d2420","_cell_guid":"0eff1ee8-b6cf-425b-b81d-13bedd08745c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 8 | Let's Visualize the Female to Male Ratio Data | Horizontal Bar Chart\n* We are leveraging plotly to visualize the ratio data with a horizontal bar chart\n* Notice that we are using orientation in our trace object to denotate that this chart is meant to be horizontal\n\nA 100% stacked column chart is an Excel chart type meant to show the relative percentage of multiple data series in stacked columns, where the total (cumulative) of stacked columns always equals 100%.\n\nMore details on horizontal bar graphs with plotly can be found in [Docs!](https://plot.ly/python/bar-charts/)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"834d98edecb1021a7d7bce40f3fdb0f8fa0f31bc","_cell_guid":"81b45870-fc47-4ca7-9bd2-dd25793adc3f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trace1 = go.Bar(\n    y=d.index.get_values(),\n    x=d['Ratio'],text=d['Ratio'],textposition='auto',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgb(158,202,225)',\n        line=dict(\n            color='rgb(8,48,107)',\n            width=1.5,\n        )\n    ),\n    opacity=0.6\n)\n\ndata = [trace1]\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    barmode='group',title='Ratio of Male to Female Employees')\n\nfig = dict(data=data, layout=layout)\niplot(fig, filename='Ratio of Male to Female Employees')","execution_count":37,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f5a00de076d338c7ed70576af290c106b3d34628","_cell_guid":"0630b6ee-0d6f-4e7c-bcec-6adfaeddb87f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Basic Stack Bar Charts\nA stacked bar graph (or stacked bar chart) is a chart that uses bars to show comparisons between categories of data, but with ability to break down and compare parts of a whole.

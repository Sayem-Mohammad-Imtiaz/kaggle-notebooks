The objective of the dataset is **to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes**, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.\n\n## Content\n\nThe datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n\n## Variable Description\n\n- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant\n- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test\n- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)\n- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)\n- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)\n- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)\n- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function\n- Age: Age (years)\n- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) 268 of 768 are 1, the others are 0\n\nsource: https://www.kaggle.com/sercanyesiloz\n\noverview data: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import the libraries\n\nexample:\n\n```import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# your code here\n\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-05T03:17:01.764775Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-05T03:17:01.765171Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-05T03:17:01.769167Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-05T03:17:01.765137Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-05T03:17:01.768101Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\n\n## 1.

In statistics' community, the regression task is the procedure to estimating the relationship between variables. In the machine learning community, you'll se the comparisons with classification task where regression will be often associated as the task of predict numerical targets, and classification predict categorical variables (check out [this quora's answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-main-difference-between-classification-problems-and-regression-problems-in-machine-learning)). For this challange, you should consider the statistical regression culture, where the relationship between input and output is the problem itself (check out [this other one](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-main-difference-between-classification-and-regression-problems)).\n\nBefore take any pick up of regression technique, let's take a minute to breathe and reflect about hypothesis. The first step to master the relationship between two variables is to *choose what relationship could be interesting to be investigated*.

In 1961, Marvel relaunched its superhero comic books publishing line. This new era started what has been known as the Marvel Age of Comics. Characters created during this period such as Spider-Man, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men, together with those created during the Golden Age such as Captain America, are known worldwide and have become cultural icons during the last decades. Later, Marvel's characters popularity has been revitalized even more due to the release of several recent movies which recreate the comic books using spectacular modern special effects. Nowadays, it is possible to access the content of the comic books via a digital platform created by Marvel, where it is possible to subscribe monthly or yearly to get access to the comics. More information about the Marvel Universe can be found here."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"3\">**The dataset:**<font/>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dataset contains heroes and comics, and the relationship between them.

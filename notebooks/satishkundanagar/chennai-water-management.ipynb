Water level gets increased through water bubbling from the bottom of a water reservoir from underground waterbeds.\n\n- Increase in water level depends on:<br>\na. Amount of rain in and round the water reservoir and in the neighboring state from where the water gets flown.\nb. Increase in ground level water which sometimes gets moved from earth's waterbed to the water reservoir.\n\n- Rate of evaporation of water depends on:<br>\na. Surface area of the water reservoir which gets exposed to the sunlight.\nb. Depth of the reservoir. More deeper the reservoir is more amount of water gets collected.\n\n#### Overall observations on the given data set\n\n1. Though we see a very good amount of rain in monsoon we do not see a rise in water level eiter in monsoon or autumn seasons. Also, please note that a good amount of rain is not an indicator of the amount collected or flown to the water reservoir. Because, a heavy down pour in and around a water reservoir may or may not get collected in the reservoir. Some percentage of rain goes to drainage, some may get collected in nearby ponds or may get soaked into the ground.\n\n2. Water levels are quiet high in winter and autumn season when the temperature is not as high as we see during summer.\n\n3. As per the data, Poondi water reservoir seems to be having highest capacity among other water reservoirs given in the data."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

Sao Paulo is the most populated city in Brazil. \n\n![title](./brazil_regions.JPG)\n\n(Courtesy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Brazil)\n\nGeographically, country Brazil is divided into 5 regions. They are:<br>\n- North Region\n- North-east Region\n- Central-west Region\n- South-east Region\n- South Region\n\nThe 26 states and a federal district can be seen categorized among these 5 regions in the map above.\n\nSince, forest fires are either due to a drastic change in the climatic conditions around the forest regions or this trouble could be a man made. We cannot rule either of these. However, with the limited set of data and the information we have gathered till now we cannot prove either of the cases completely and for sure the man made angle cannot be proven with the given data set although we may prove partially that the forests are catching fire because of the sudden change in the climatic conditions.\n\nTo get a better understanding forest fires across the country, we need to understand the climatic changes experienced across different regions and in fact in every state of the country Brazil.\nAccording to the KÃ¶ppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes:<br>\n- **Desert** - is a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation.\n- **Equatorial** - climate is typically hot, very humid and wet. Can expect at least 60mm of rain fall every month of the year.\n- **Tropical** -  the temperature remains relatively constant (hot) throughout the year. Sunlight is intense.\n- **Semiarid** - receives precipitation below potential evapotranspiration (evaporation from Earth's land + Ocean + Plant transpiration), but not as low as a desert climate.\n- **Oceanic** - Cool summers and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Lacks dry season.\n- **Subtropical** - climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and cold to mild winters."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment

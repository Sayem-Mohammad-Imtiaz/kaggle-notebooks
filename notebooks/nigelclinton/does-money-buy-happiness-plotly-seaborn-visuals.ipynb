The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels, was released at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.\"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Content\n\n\"The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll.\nThe columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.\"\n\n* Ladder score: Happiness score or subjective well-being. This is the national average response to the question of life evaluations.\n* Logged GDP per capita: The GDP-per-capita time series from one year to another using countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth in the following year.\n* Social support: Social support refers to assistance or support provided by members of social networks (like government) to an individual.\n* Healthy life expectancy: Healthy life expectancy is the average life in good health - that is to say without irreversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities - of a fictitious generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year.\n* Freedom to make life choices: Freedom to make life choices is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?” ... It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment for other waves where the happiness question was not asked\n* Generosity: Generosity is the residual of regressing national average of response to the GWP question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.\n* Perceptions of corruption: The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: “Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not” and “Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?”\n* Ladder score in Dystopia: It has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages. Dystopia as a benchmark against which to compare contributions from each of the six factors. Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. ... Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world's lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.\n\nWorld Happiness Report Official Website: https://worldhappiness.report/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Does Money Buy Happiness?\n\n\"For many Americans, the pursuit of happiness and the pursuit of money come to much the same thing.

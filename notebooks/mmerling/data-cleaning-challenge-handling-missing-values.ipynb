It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n> **Is this value missing becuase it wasn't recorded or becuase it dosen't exist?**\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doens't exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probalby do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing becuase it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. (This is called \"imputation\" and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n\nLet's work through an example. Looking at the number of missing values in the nfl_data dataframe, I notice that the column `TimesSec` has a lot of missing values in it: "},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"77739e82-8d32-4374-84bf-a924b6065168","_uuid":"b65aea6046964806e44422c057bce8bd7f8e59d5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# look at the # of missing points in the first ten columns\nmissing_values_count[0:10]","execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1b17f4c9-dcab-4857-82f9-a2534e804c91","_uuid":"5cff158285ab37a89b80dcc35d5c690cdb42d3a4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By looking at [the documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016), I can see that this column has information on the number of seconds left in the game when the play was made. This means that these values are probably missing because they were not recorded, rather than because they don't exist. So, it would make sense for us to try and guess what they should be rather than just leaving them as NA's.\n\nOn the other hand, there are other fields, like `PenalizedTeam` that also have lot of missing fields. In this case, though, the field is missing because if there was no penalty then it doesn't make sense to say *which* team was penalized. For this column, it would make more sense to either leave it empty or to add a third value like \"neither\" and use that to replace the NA's.\n\n> **Tip:** This is a great place to read over the dataset documentation if you haven't already! If you're working with a dataset that you've gotten from another person, you can also try reaching out to them to get more information.\n\nIf you're doing very careful data analysis, this is the point at which you'd look at each column individually to figure out the best strategy for filling those missing values. For the rest of this notebook, we'll cover some \"quick and dirty\" techniques that can help you with missing values but will probably also end up removing some useful information or adding some noise to your data.\n\n## Your turn!\n\n* Look at the columns `Street Number Suffix` and `Zipcode` from the `sf_permits` datasets.

The overarching purpose of a pipeline is to streamline processes in data analytics and machine learning.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2 style=\"background-color:#f15a39; padding: 20px; font-family:cursive\"> Why Machine Learning Pipelines? </h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[The key benefit](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492053187/ch01.html) of machine learning pipelines lies in the automation of the model life cycle steps. When new training data becomes available, a workflow which includes data validation, preprocessing, model training, analysis, and deployment should be triggered. We have observed too many data science teams manually going through these steps, which is costly and also a source of errors.\n\nLetâ€™s cover some details of the benefits of machine learning pipelines:\n1. Ability to focus on new models, not maintaining existing models. Many data scientists spending their days on keeping previously developed models up to date. They run scripts manually to preprocess their training data, they write one-off deployment scripts, or they manually tune their models. Automated pipelines allow data scientists to develop new models, the fun part of their job. Ultimately, this will lead to higher job satisfaction and retention in a competitive job market.\n\n2. Prevention of bugs. In manual machine learning workflows, a common source of bugs is a change in the preprocessing step after a model was trained. In this case, we would deploy a model with different processing instructions than what we trained the model with. These bugs might be really difficult to debug since an inference of the model is still possible, but simply incorrect. With automated workflows, these errors can be prevented.\n\n3. Standardization: standardized machine learning pipelines improve the experience of a data science team. Due to the standardized setups, data scientists can be onboarded quickly or move across teams and find the same development environments. This improves efficiency and reduces the time spent getting set up on a new project. The time investment of setting up machine learning pipelines can also lead to an improved retention rate.\n\nIn this first notebook I will explain how to build a simple machine learning pipeline. In the upcoming notebooks I will start building on it to develop much more complex pipelines step by step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2 style=\"background-color:#f15a39; padding: 20px; font-family:cursive\"> Package imports </h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # basic plots\nimport seaborn as sns # advanced plots\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split #split the data\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler #scale the data\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier #The KNN model\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix,accuracy_score #Evaluation metrics \nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline #Sikit learn pipline \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV #cross validation","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T01:18:39.800781Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T01:18:39.801204Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T01:18:40.141648Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T01:18:39.801173Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T01:18:40.140593Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2 style=\"background-color:#f15a39; padding: 20px; font-family:cursive\"> Read the data and run quality checks </h2>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# reading the data and displaying the first 5 rows\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/heart-disease-uci/heart.csv\")\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.541713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.541984Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.590216Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.541958Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.589234Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# checking if features are in the right type\ndf.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.591757Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.592043Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.615043Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.592013Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T01:00:01.614105Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# any duplicates?

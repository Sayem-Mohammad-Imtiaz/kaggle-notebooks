Summary:\n\n* Currently, the global ranking of France of the total cases is 4th and global ranking of France of the total vaccinations per number of hundred people is 53th.\n* The total Covid cases of France is 5.881.125 cases, in which the highest number cases per day is 88.79k cases in Nov. 7 2020, then decreasing after that. The increasing significanly is coming after June 2020 (when easing of restrictions is conducted).\n(Source: https://www.france24.com/en/20200528-live-french-pm-philippe-unveils-second-phase-in-lifting-of-covid-19-lockdown)\n* From begining of December, the daily cases continuosly increase again when travel restrictions is stop.\n(Source: https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/415411/france-authorities-ease-domestic-covid-19-restrictions-dec-15-update-23). \n* In paralel, the vaccinations is started from end of December until now. It is take 3 months after the vaccination, the number of affections case starts to decreasing until now. The number of people fully vaccinated per hundred is 13.77. \n* The decreasing of Covid cases is the result of both vaccinations and the state of emergency. \n* From 15th May 2021, restaurant terraces and cultural centres are set to open, and the curfew is to be extended to 21:00. From June 9, the curfew will be 23:00. France is step by step to easing the restrictions. I think it is interesting to see the result in June and July this year to confirm if the vaccinations effect when the restrictions is lifted.

The Allen Institute and Google/Kaggle is sponsoring a research challenge that utilizes the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), which represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection (initially 30,000+ papers) available for data mining to date."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Problem Statement:\n### Risk factors associated with death from COVID-19 are not well understood. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, results of scientific studies may be differentially impacted by diverse underlying populations, testing, containment strategies, and healthcare systems."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## GDIT Approach and Executive Summary: \n### Approach\n#### General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) ML/AI specialists conducted Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to extract relevant scientific papers from the CORD-19 dataset and then applied NLP parsers to extract important statistics from the full text articles creating an analytic dataset for statistical meta-analysis. This dataset was then used to derive a pooled estimate of diabetes prevalence in fatal COVID-19 cases from scientific studies in different populations around the world, contributing to the understanding of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The process and statistical framework of this notebook can be used to identify the prevalence of other comorbidities in COVID-19 cases and add to the scientific knowledge of risk factors for COVID-19.\n\n### Included Datasets\n#### For the first submission of this notebook, the challenge metadata file and all pmc_json and pdf_json files were utilized.  At the time of submission, all code and observations can be replicated.  Future use of this notebook could incur errors if the underlying datasets are changed; which was generally the case each week leading up to the initial submission deadline.\n\n### Results\n#### At the time of submission this notebook identified 6 separate scientific studies and automated the extraction, meta-analyisis, and visualization of diabetes prevalence estimates in fatal COVID-19 cases across all studies. \n\n### Pros and Cons of this Approach\n#### Pros: 1) Automated identification and extraction of full text articles greatly reduces time intensive process of meta-analysis, 2) interdisciplinary approach involving NLP, statistics, and data visualization, 3) framework could easily be amended to study COVID-19 and other comorbidities such as hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\n#### Cons: 1) The tables of full text articles were not included in the extraction resulting in the exclusion of these papers from the meta-analysis (introducing potential for bias), 2) the challenge data comprised of text extracted into json files are often incomplete, inaccurate, and containing headers/footers which negatively impacts NLP approaches.  \n\n### Visualizations:\n* [Visualization #1](#viz1): Bar Chart to Understand When Articles Were Published\n* [Visualization #2](#viz2): Word Clouds for Exploring Text Field Composition\n* [Visualization #3](#viz3): displaCy Utilization for Entity Identification Visualization\n* [Visualization #4](#viz4): Diabetes Prevalence in Fatal COVID-19 Cases by Study\n\n### Additional Approaches Tested but not Implemented Below:\n* spaCy's web_sm and web_lg pretained models were utilized for entity identification and extraction but it is our assumption that they were not trained using medical journals and were therefore limited in their effectiveness for this specific use case\n* Following manual review of subsets of article which resulted in a sample of Y/N's to whether or not the articles were relevant, a tfidf model was created with the gensim python package in an attempt to predict which other articles were of interest.  Without proper full text, including the data from tables, the model lacked the required data to accurately predict acceptable articles (although it did a fair job at predicting those that were not relevant at all to the COVID-19 challenge).\n* Additional python packages, such as medaCy and Bert, were researched and tested but they too appeared to lack relevantly trained models and/or the ability to overcome shortcomings in the provided data set to be of use in this phase of the challenge."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Environment Setup"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom pandasql import sqldf # sql access to pandas dataframes\nsql = lambda q: sqldf(q, globals())\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport json #utilized when parsing the json files associated with the challenge articles\nfrom smart_open import open\nimport os\n\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS #For creating/visualizing Word Clouds in the notebook\n\nimport spacy #Entity Extraction/Labeling\nfrom spacy.pipeline import EntityRuler,Sentencizer\nfrom spacy.lang.en import English\nfrom spacy import displacy #Utilized to explore entity identification in-line with the documents themselves\n\nimport matplotlib #Meta-Analysis Visualizations\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import figure\n%matplotlib inline\n\n#Adjust the parameters below, when required, to help review dataframes easier.  \n##With a fail amount of the data being long text fields, for example, adjusting the column widths will help when trying to manually review data.\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth',100)\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading the Challenge Metadata file\n### The challenge metadata file is often updated and the subsequent dataframe may change.

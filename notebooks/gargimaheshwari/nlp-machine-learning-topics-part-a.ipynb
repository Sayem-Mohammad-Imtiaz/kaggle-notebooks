Introduction\n\nThe NIPS conference (Neural Information Processing Systems) is one of the most prestigious yearly events in the machine learning community. At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more. \n\nFirst, I will explore the CSV file to determine what type of data I can use for the analysis and how it is structured. A research paper typically consists of a title, an abstract and the main text. Other data such as figures and tables were not extracted from the PDF files. Each paper discusses a novel technique or improvement. In this analysis, I will focus on analyzing these papers with natural language processing methods."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport re\n\npapers = pd.read_csv('../input/papers.csv')\npapers.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8664146483cd9d5d0955ee95c8ba7c7b878076a0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For the analysis of the papers, I am only interested in the text data associated with the paper as well as the year the paper was published in.\n\nI will analyze this text data using natural language processing.

LDA is able to perform topic detection on large document sets, determining what the main 'topics' are in a large unlabeled set of texts. A 'topic' is a collection of words that tend to co-occur often. The hypothesis is that LDA might be able to clarify what the different topics in the research titles are. These topics can then be used as a starting point for further analysis.\n\nLDA does not work directly on text data. First, it is necessary to convert the documents into a simple vector representation. This representation will then be used by LDA to determine the topics. Each entry of a 'document vector' will correspond with the number of times a word occurred in the document. In conclusion, I will convert a list of titles into a list of vectors, all with length equal to the vocabulary. For example, *'Analyzing machine learning trends with neural networks.'* would be transformed into <code>[1, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0]</code>.\n\nI'll then plot the 10 most common words based on the outcome of this operation (the list of document vectors)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"53bc3f09a5dcd18a7c685cd54edddc26fdcbdf6c"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\ndef plot_10_most_common_words(count_data, count_vectorizer):\n    words = count_vectorizer.get_feature_names()\n    total_counts = np.zeros(len(words))\n    for t in count_data:\n        total_counts += t.toarray()[0]\n    \n    count_dict = (zip(words, total_counts))\n    count_dict = sorted(count_dict, key=lambda x:x[1], reverse=True)\n    words = [w[0] for w in count_dict[0:10]]\n    counts = [w[1] for w in count_dict[0:10]]\n    x_pos = np.arange(len(words))\n\n    sns.barplot(x_pos, counts, palette=(\"plasma\"))\n    plt.xticks(x_pos, words, rotation = 90) \n    plt.xlabel('words', fontsize = 13)\n    plt.ylabel('counts', fontsize = 13)\n    plt.title('10 most common words', fontsize = 15)\n    plt.show()\n    \n    return dict(count_dict)\n\ncount_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words = 'english')\ncount_data = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(papers['title_processed'])\n\nplt.figure(figsize = (13, 8))\ncount_dict = plot_10_most_common_words(count_data, count_vectorizer)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bf47e2fc17a497a4b6f5d7714f8e0464b3286f56"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since most cells in the matrix <code>count_data</code> will be zero, I am interested in knowing what percentage of cells contain non-zero values.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation and GridSearch\n\nWhile there are many different analyses one can do using LDA, I will only focus on finding the optimal number of topics from this data.\n\nTypically, one calculates the 'perplexity' metric to determine which number of topics is best and iterate over different amounts of topics until the lowest 'perplexity' is found. A model with higher log-likelihood and lower perplexity (exp(-1. * log-likelihood per word)) is considered to be good.\n\nTo find the best model, I will use GridSearch.

Introduction\n\nIn my last notebook on [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://www.kaggle.com/gargimaheshwari/nlp-machine-learning-topics-part-a) I used <code>sklearn</code>'s GridSearch to find the best LDA model for the number of macine learning topics in the NIPS papers. We saw that using <code>search_params</code> over <code>[20, 25, 30, 35]</code> number of topics and <code>[10, 20, 50 ]</code> maximum iterations, the best model turns out to be the one with 20 topics and 50 iterations, with a perplexity of approximately 2453.\n\nHere, I would like to take that analysis further.\n\nAn important point to note is that perplexity alone might not be the best measure to evaluate topic models because it doesn’t consider the context and semantic associations between words. These can be captured using *topic coherence measure*. I will explore this measure here.\n\nFirst, I'll load the necessary libraries and the data."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport re\n\npapers = pd.read_csv('../input/papers.csv')\npapers.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2cd319f15396be27fcc018024767d60240766c2f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As before, I will process the database to remove unnecessary fields, and then process the text using the <code>re</code> library."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4f56962721e5a94874973b46ff16a520bcf4e474"},"cell_type":"code","source":"papers = papers.drop([\"id\", \"event_type\", \"pdf_name\"], axis = 1)\n\npapers['title_processed'] = papers['title'].map(lambda x: re.sub('[,\\.!?]', '', x))\npapers['title_processed'] = papers['title_processed'].map(str.lower)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9fc0348dab259633d992c818b2647b066a2fca4d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

LDA Topic Coherence measure\n\nAn approach to finding the optimal number of topics is to build many LDA models with different values of number of topics (k) and pick the one that gives the highest coherence value. Choosing a ‘k’ that marks the end of a rapid growth of topic coherence usually offers meaningful and interpretable topics. Picking an even higher value can sometimes provide more granular sub-topics.

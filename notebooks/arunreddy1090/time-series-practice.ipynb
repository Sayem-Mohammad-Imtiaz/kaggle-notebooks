Furthermore, this component requires the parameters P and Q which are the same as p and q, but for the seasonal component. Finally, D is the order of seasonal integration representing the number of differences required  to remove seasonality from the series. Combining all, we get the SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s) model. The main takeaway is: before modelling with SARIMA, we must apply transformations to our time series to remove seasonality and any non-stationary behaviors."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Auto ARIMA**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pmdarima\nimport pmdarima as pm\nmodel = pm.auto_arima(df['Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number'], m=11, seasonal=True, start_p=0, start_q=0, max_order=4, test='adf',\n                      error_action='ignore',suppress_warnings=True, stepwise=True, trace=True)\n## actually we have to set m=11*12,but it take too much time and it doesnt matter much.

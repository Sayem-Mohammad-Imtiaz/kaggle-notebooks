There are two methods of evaluating models in data science, Hold-Out and Cross-Validation. To avoid overfitting, both methods use a test set (not seen by the model) to evaluate model performance. In this method, the mostly large dataset is randomly divided to three subsets:\nTraining set is a subset of the dataset used to build predictive models.

The error (or disturbance) of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.\n\nWhat is a Residual in Regression?\nWhen you perform simple linear regression (or any other type of regression analysis), you get a line of best fit. The data points usually don’t fall exactly on this regression equation line; they are scattered around. A residual is the vertical distance between a data point and the regression line. Each data point has one residual. They are:\n\nPositive if they are above the regression line,\nNegative if they are below the regression line,\nZero if the regression line actually passes through the poin\nAs residuals are the difference between any data point and the regression line, they are sometimes called “errors.” Error in this context doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with the analysis; it just means that there is some unexplained difference. In other words, the residual is the error that isn’t explained by the regression line.\n\nThe residual(e) can also be expressed with an equation. The e is the difference between the predicted value (ŷ) and the observed value.

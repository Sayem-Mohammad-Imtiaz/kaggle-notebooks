With this data it should be able to accurately predict whether a patient is more prone to heart issues. This can be helpful in many ways for doctors who study heart problems and diagnosing patients whether they have serious issues or not. \n\nI think the two best models to use would be a decision tree classifier and a logistic regressor. Using a decision tree classifier is slightly more benefical for this dataset. Since all of the data provided is numerical it makes it easier to recieve a categorical response instead of a number value. Also using a logistic regressor is a good model of recieving an accuracy score for the data provided. It does this because logistic regression is a type of regression analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for data visualisation purposes\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier ,plot_tree # Our model and a handy tool for visualising trees\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-29T06:52:11.727822Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-29T06:52:11.728285Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-29T06:52:11.737558Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-29T06:52:11.728247Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-29T06:52:11.73611Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Logistic Regression uses regression analysis, which is a type of predictive modeling which is used to find the relationship between a dependent variable (Y variable) and either one independent variable (the X variable) or a series of independant variables.

The original Netflix dataset is around 2G and in this project we only take 2M data from the original data which is preprocessed into the form of user, movie, rating. The preprocess method is beyond the scope of this project.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Theoretical Background\n\nThere are generally two basic algorithms for the recommender system, user collaborative filtering (user CF) and item collaborative filtering (item CF). User CF is a form of collaborative filtering based on the similarity between users calculated using people's ratings of those items\nwhile item CF is based on the similarity between items.\n\nIn this project, we user item CF instead of user CF for the following reasons:\n\n* The number of users weighs more than the number of products, which makes item CF more computationally efficient.\n* Items (movie) will not change frequently in this project, while users’ preferences may change frequently. Item CF can help save computation.\n* Recommending movies based on users’ historical data makes more sense intuitively. \n\nTo build the item CF model we first need to define the relationship between items. Some possible strategies are making use of the categories, producers, actors, countries, years, earnings and so on. Here, however,  we use rating history to build relationships between movies based on limited data, which means the number of users rated two movies denotes the level of how these two movies are connected.\n\nNext I am gonna introduce the concept of co-occurrence matrix. A co-occurrence matrix is a matrix that is defined over an image to be the distribution of co-occurring pixel values (grayscale values, or colors) at a given offset. In this project co-occurrence matrix denotes the frequency any two movies show up together. Then we normalize the co-occurrence matrix and multiply it with the user rating matrix to get the final result, as shown in the figure below. \n\n![](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sriXLf1x7wZn9Je36hjc-AAu87I0bmV4/view?usp=sharing)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sriXLf1x7wZn9Je36hjc-AAu87I0bmV4/view?usp=sharing\n\nNote that for missing values in the user rating matrix we use the average rating of that user to fill in the vacancy. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Algorithm\n\nThe core of the algorithm is matrix multiplication in Mapreduce.

To do so, I will follow a standard data science methodology with business problem, [data preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_preparation), [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) and [model building](https://towardsdatascience.com/seven-major-steps-for-building-a-data-science-model-c1761408dd17) to predict and describe the underlying factors that contribute to employee turnover.\n\n# Business problem\n\nImplementing workplace policies that benefit workers and help boost employee retention is not just a “nice” thing for businesses to do for their employees. Maintaining\na stable workforce by reducing employee turnover, using data science to understand their causes and consequences, also makes good business sense, as it can result in significant cost savings to employers.\n\nIn fact, according to the [Work Institute’s 2019 Retention Report](https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf#page=9), employee turnover costs businesses more than 600 billion dollars every year. They estimate that for each employee you lose, it will cost you up to 33\\% of their annual salary to replace them.\n\n## Goal\n\n> **What factors contribute to employee turnover and what are our recomendation for managers to avoid that?**\n\n# Data Sources\n\nThis notebook is based on the [HR Analytics dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/giripujar/hr-analytics). It was uploaded by Giri Pujar in 2018 and, currently, is evaluated as a Bronze data set. There are no indications if this is a fictional or an anonymized dataset. One of the secondary goals of this notebook is to find clues that suggest if  this was created using rules and random values or not.\n\n## Obtain and scrub"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import the neccessary libraries for data manipulation and visual representation\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as matplot\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/hr-analytics/HR_comma_sep.csv\")\ndf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['Work_accident'] = df['Work_accident'] == 1\ndf['left'] = df['left'] == 1\ndf['promotion_last_5years'] = df['promotion_last_5years'] == 1\ndf.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.rename(columns={'satisfaction_level': 'satisfaction', \n                        'last_evaluation': 'evaluation',\n                        'number_project': 'projectCount',\n                        'average_montly_hours': 'averageMonthlyHours',\n                        'time_spend_company': 'yearsAtCompany',\n                        'Work_accident': 'workAccident',\n                        'promotion_last_5years': 'hadPromotion',\n                        'Department' : 'department',\n                        })\ndf.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Analysis\n\n## Current turnover rates\n\nIn the context of human resources, turnover is the act of replacing an employee with a new employee \\[[1]\\].

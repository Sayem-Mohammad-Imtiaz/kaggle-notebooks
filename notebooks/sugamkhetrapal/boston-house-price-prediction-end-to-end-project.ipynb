Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan\nStatistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. The attributes are defined as follows (taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository):\n1. CRIM: per capita crime rate by town\n2. ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n3. INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n4. CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n5. NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n6. RM: average number of rooms per dwelling\n7. AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n8. DIS: weighted distances to \fve Boston employment centers\n9. RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways\n10. TAX: full-value property-tax rate per USD 10,000\n11. PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town\n12. B: 1000(Bk - 0:63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n13. LSTAT: % lower status of the population\n14. MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in USD 1000s\n\nWe can see that the input attributes have a mixture of units.\n\nWe will perform the following steps:\n2. Load the Dataset (Import libraries and load dataset)\n3. Analyze Data (Descriptive Statistics)\n4. Data Visualizations (Unimodal and Multimodal, Summary of Ideas)\n5. Validation Dataset\n6. Evaluate Algorithms: Baseline\n7. Evaluate Algorithms: Standardization\n8. Improve Results with Tuning\n9. Ensemble Methods\n10. Tune Ensemble Methods\n11. Finalize Model\n12. Summary\n13.

We need to think about transforms that we could use later to better expose the structure which in turn may improve modeling accuracy. So far it would be worth trying:\n* Feature selection and removing the most correlated attributes.\n* Normalizing the dataset to reduce the effect of differing scales.\n* Standardizing the dataset to reduce the effects of differing distributions.\n\nWith lots of additional time we would also explore the possibility of binning (discretization) of the data. This can often improve accuracy for decision tree algorithms.\n\n# 5. Validation Dataset\n\nIt is a good idea to use a validation hold-out set. This is a sample of the data that we hold back from our analysis and modeling. We use it right at the end of our project to confirm the\naccuracy of our final model. It is a smoke test that we can use to see if we messed up and to give us confidence on our estimates of accuracy on unseen data.

We also need to avoid data leakage when we transform the data.

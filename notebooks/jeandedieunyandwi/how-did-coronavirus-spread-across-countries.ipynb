To see how quick the spread was, I am going to use Coronavirus dataset available[here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset) to make an intreractive map showing how the pandemic started in one country, and thus ending up spreading to the rest of the world.\n\nif you did like to learn about the Choropleth Map (which is the one used in this project), you can learn more [here](https://plotly.com/python/choropleth-maps/#world-choropleth-map). At this point, we are using Choropleth Map to make a map of world, also being able to represent variation of covid19 cases over time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#I will start importing all required libraries. \n\nimport numpy as np #for numerical computation\nimport pandas as pd #for working with dataframes\nimport plotly #For interactive visualizations\nimport plotly.express as px #for Interactive visualizations\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go #world mapping\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport os\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Reading the data\ncorona_df=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona_df.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corona_df.tail(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, the first instance of coronavirus from the data that we have was recorded on 22/01/2020, and the last one being 23/09/2020.

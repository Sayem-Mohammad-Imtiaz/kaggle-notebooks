So Fisrt Question in your mind ( who are beginner ) is What is this ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”?????\n\nOH, No need to worry guys, it is as simple as that just know about this and Boom ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥.\n\nThis statement is given by a Kaggler whose dataset link here : https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction\n\n**Our client is an Insurance company that has provided Health Insurance to its customers now they need your help in building a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.**\n\n\n**Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.**\n\n**Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.**\n\n**RoadMap :** \n            So we have to analyze the statement first and then look into the dataset then choose what we have to do for making model, do some preprocessing etc.\n            \n\nHere we go ::::::::::::::::"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Importing some relevent libraries**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"According to dataset, it contains three files :\n* Train.csv\n* Test.csv\n* Sample_submission.csv\n\n### Train.csv\n\nThis file consists of features for making a good prediction model. \n* Id\n* Gender\n* Age\n* Driving_License\n* Region_Code\n* Previously_Insured\n* Vehicle_Age\n* Vehicle_Damage\n* Annual_Premium\n* Policy_Sales_Channel\n* Vintage\n* Response\n\n**Note : Response is what we have to predict (\"Remember\")**\n\n### Test.csv\n\nThis file also same as Train.csv but one differnce. You know it is a test file and response is a predictable feature of dataset so we have only other features than Response. So Just we have to test it.\n\n### Sample_Submission.csv\n\nThis file consists of submission so **In my Opinion, we should not look into it beacuse it is a solution of that which column has greater importances of predicting the Response of dataset.** Others, it is upto you guys.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data =

is a classification problem that classify 0 and 1 so what we are going to do with it is choosing a sklearn classification problem (**Simple Machine Learning**). \n\n**Note : It is also done by Deep learning too. As it is a classification prob so we can do it by applying keras and make a network of that. Make sense ??**\n\nYes, It's okay.

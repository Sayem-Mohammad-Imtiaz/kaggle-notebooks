In this sector, which is expected to develop further in the future, company owners and customers have many unanswered questions such as the transportation of materials, their storage, and the time to reach the buyer.

The correlation coefficient's values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect negative correlation (-1.0) means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.\n\n\nFor example, large-cap mutual funds generally have a high positive correlation to the Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index or nearly one. Small-cap stocks have a positive correlation to the S&P, but it's not as high or approximately 0.8.\n\nHowever, put option prices and their underlying stock prices will tend to have a negative correlation. For review, a put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. Put option contracts become more profitable when the underlying stock price decreases. In other words, as the stock price increases, the put option prices go down, which is a direct and high-magnitude negative correlation.\n\nCalculated correlation (r) between two variables value:\n* r<0.20 and values close to zero are not related or indicates a very weak relationship.\n* Weak correlation between 0.20-0.39\n* Moderate correlation between 0.40-0.59\n* A high level of correlation between 0.60-0.79\n* If it is 0.80-1.0, it is interpreted as a very high correlation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"list1 = [\"Customer_care_calls\",\"Customer_rating\",\"Cost_of_the_Product\",\"Prior_purchases\",\"Discount_offered\",\"Weight_in_gms\",\"Reached.on.Time_Y.N\"]\nplt.figure(figsize = (16,5))\nsns.heatmap(data[list1].corr(), annot = True, fmt = \".2f\")\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-25T19:53:54.587895Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-25T19:53:54.58823Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.118377Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-25T19:53:54.588196Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.117337Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see in the correlation chart above, the most remarkable relationships: \n* Reached on Time - Discount Offered (0.40)\n* Customer Care Calls - Cost of The Product (0.32)\n* Weight of The Product in Grams - Discount Offered (-0.38)\n\n***\nLet's take a closer look at these striking relationships.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"4\"></a><br>\n### Relation Between Product Arrived on Time - Discount Offered","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data1=data[data[\"Reached.on.Time_Y.N\"]==1].sort_values(\"Discount_offered\",ascending=True)\na=list(Counter(data1[\"Discount_offered\"]).keys())\nb=list(Counter(data1[\"Discount_offered\"]).values())\n\n\ndata2=data[data[\"Reached.on.Time_Y.N\"]==0].sort_values(\"Discount_offered\",ascending=True)\nc=list(Counter(data2[\"Discount_offered\"]).keys())\nd=list(Counter(data2[\"Discount_offered\"]).values())\n\nfig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=a,\n    y=b,\n    name = '<b>not</b> reached on time (1)', # Style name/legend entry with html tags\n))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=c,\n    y=d,\n    name='reached on time (0)',\n))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title=\"Discount and Delay Relationship\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Discount Offered\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Number of Discounted Products\",\n    font=dict(\n        family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n        size=13,\n        color=\"RebeccaPurple\"\n    )\n)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.119623Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.119898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.151674Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.119869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-25T19:53:55.150714Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As can be seen in the graphic above, the products that received more than 10 US dollars discount did not arrive on time. 10 dollars and less discounted items were more often delivered to the buyer on time.

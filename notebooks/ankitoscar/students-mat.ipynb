Most students in the schools are in the age range of 15-18\n    2. In all three periods, we can see that students in the age range of 15-18 score better grades as compared to other age groups\n    3. Students who go out more and drink more score less, so do students who do not go out often and drink moderately. However, there are some outliers.\n    4. Students with poor health and high alcohol consumption score better grades and vice versa. Students who have good health and high alcohol consumption score more.\n    5. Engagement in extra curricular activities is an indicator of good health and low alcohol consumption.\n    6. Failures are common in students who do not engage in exta curricular activities and have moderate alcohol consumption. Students with high alcohol consumption have less failures.\n    7. Students who want to pursue higher studies have better grades.\n    8. Students in romantic relationships have higher alcohol consumption. Students with low to moderate alcohol consumption having no romantic relationships have better grades.\n    9. Students who do not spend time in self study but attend extra paid classes score better. Also, students score very low also take extra paid classes.\n    10. Family and school education support doesn't really matter for a student's grades.\n    11. Students with poorer family relations do not drink much and have better grades and vice versa.\n    12. Students who live in urban areas and with low alcohol consumption score significantly higher than others.\n    13. The median scores of males is slightly better than females. Also, female students have shown low alcohol consumption and better grades in all three periods.\n    14. The drinking habits for males and females in weekends is pretty much same, along with going out frequency. However, during workday, females have less free time and tend to drink less than their counterparts.\n    15. Most of students whose parents are working government jobs and are teachers score significantly higher than others.\n    16. Also, the students who score a lot have mothers who are teachers.\n    17. Students go out often in general but those who go out still have less absents.\n    18. Some students who score a lot have moderate free time.\n    19. Students who consume less alcohol and score more have very less absents.\n    20. A lot of students have internet and those who have score better than those who don't.\n    21.

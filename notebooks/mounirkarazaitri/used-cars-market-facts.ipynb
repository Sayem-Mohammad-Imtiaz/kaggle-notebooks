I am fascinated by the data. When I had to make a project, as a part of my training with Jovian [[Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas]](zerotopandas.com), I tried to combine my passion for data and my all-time favorite topic : Cars !<br>\nAs a car-enthousiast, I like working on cars. I'm often in the market for used cars and parts. The buying process involves lots of research and comparison. The ultimate goal is to get the best deal, using all the available tools.<br>\n___But what is a good deal ?___<br>\nWhile many parameters influence a car buyer, the decision always involves _emotion_. The first thing to consider before taking any __decision__ is to have as much __good quality data__ as possible. We have then to perform analysis and extract informations.<br>\nIn this notebook, I study a public dataset available on [KAGGLE](kaggle.com). The dataset is scraped from __Craiglist__, a very popular classified ads in the US, and north America. It contains informations from around 450k car classified ads. It is updated every 18 months and contains a fair amount of properties for each transaction (26 columns).

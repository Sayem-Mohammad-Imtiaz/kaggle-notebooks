There is a negative correlation between how often a team attempts to convert a 4th down and the number of wins a team has.  We see that that the true coef for PercentAttempts falls in quite a large range (-93, -21) and that with an R^2 value of 0.024, about 1/4 of all wins can be attributed to PercentAttempts.  This means in a 256 game season among all teams, approximately 64 wins were affected by attempts on 4th Down.   \n\nHowever, I do not believe that this can reliably attest to the discussion of whether or not to go for it on 4th Down.  We see that that no team even attempts 1/4 of their 4th downs.  For now, I posit that there is insufficient data resulting from a reluctance of coaches to make an attempt.  This is also a limited set as it is only data for the 2015 season.

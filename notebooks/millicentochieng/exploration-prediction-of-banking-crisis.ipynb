It is debt issued by the lenders within the country (eg.Financial Institutions within the country). \n* Only 2 countries; Angola and Zimbabwe were in the Domestic Debt in Default between the years 1860 and 2014\n\n2) Sovereign  External Debt Default: External debt is the portion of a country's debt that was borrowed from foreign lenders, including commercial banks, governments, or international financial institutions. These loans, including interest, must usually be paid in the currency in which the loan was made. To earn the needed currency, the borrowing country may sell and export goods to the lender's country. \n* All the countries except Mauritius suffered Sovereign  External Debt Default between the years 1860 and 2014. Countries that were affected the most include;Central African Republic, Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe.\n\n3) Systemic Crisis: Systemic crisis is a domino effect in which a financial trouble spreads. between institutions and markets until it affects the whole monetary. and financial system with dire global economic consequences. \n* Between 1860 and 2014, all countries except Angola, Mauritius and South Africa were affected by Systemic Crisis. Most affected countries being Central African Republic,Zimbabwe,Kenya and Nigeria.\n\n4) Currency Crisis: A currency crisis is a situation in which serious doubt exists as to whether a country's central bank has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to maintain the country's fixed exchange rate. The crisis is often accompanied by a speculative attack in the foreign exchange market. A currency crisis results from chronic balance of payments deficits, and thus is also called a balance of payments crisis. Often such a crisis culminates in a devaluation of the currency. \n* All countries were affected by Currency Crisis in that period and the most affected countries were Zimbabwe,Zambia,Angola,South Africa.\n\n5) Inflation Crisis: Inflation is a quantitative measure of the rate at which the average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy increases over a period of time. It is the constant rise in the general level of prices where a unit of currency buys less than it did in prior periods.   \n* All the countries were affected by the Inflation crisis in that period; the most affected countries being Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria.\n\n**Dependent Variable**\n\n6) Banking Crisis: A banking crisis is often associated with financial crisis. It refers to a panic or a bank run during which investors sell off assets or withdraw money from savings accounts because they fear that the value of those assets will drop if they remain in a financial institution.\n* Between the periods 1860 to 2014, all the countries suffered Banking Crisis and the most affected countries were;Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya.\n\n###### other observations;\n\n* All the countries that suffered systemic crisis also suffered banking crisis.

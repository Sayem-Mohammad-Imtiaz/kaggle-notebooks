I have watched all the movies in the IMDb Top 250 movies of all time! \n\nFrom this dataset i am curious to find out:\n* What are the top countries producing movie content?\n* Which are the top Languages in which movies are produced?\n* What genre are most movies made in?\n* Visualize the rise in movie content released each year and the drop in content because of COVID-19 Pandemic.\n\nI am looking forward to explore various visualization techniques like charts, graphs and word clouds.\n\n**Data Profile**\n\nThe data source i want to use for this project is: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+movies.csv\nThe dataset has 4 different .csv files out of which i will be focusing on 'IMDb movies.csv'\n\nThis dataset has been explored by multiple users to find demographic information of all the movie releases from the 1900s to 2020. A few explorations done on this dataset are: \n* This project explores various visualizations and statistical analysis of the PG ratings and viewership as well as visualization of movies using Choropleth. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/ritesh7355/netflix-eda-visualization-for-beginner\n* This project contains visualizations, corellation and statistical analysis of various factors like Highest grossing movies, ratings, dutaions and income. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/nithinpolavarapu/data-visualization-recommendations\n\n\nData has been scraped from the publicly available website https://www.imdb.com. The data is a .svg file. It consists of entries like name, release year, genre, country, language, etc.\nThe Dataset is fairly clean and has all the variables that I am interested in researching about.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T21:02:24.163809Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T21:02:24.164195Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T21:02:24.181Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T21:02:24.164163Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T21:02:24.179697Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Analysis**\n\nI will be analysing the dataset using simple visualizations to answer the above mentioned questions.

In each match, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the **Nexus**) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called **turrets**, or **towers**. Also, it's **impossible** for a match to end in a tie since it only ends when one Nexus is destroyed.\n\nNow that you're already introduced to the basics of the game, here are a few more things to notice:\n*   Each match has 5 players in each team.\n*   Matches last anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes.\n*   Players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match.\n*   Champions begin every match at level 1, and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18.\n*   *Ward* is the name given to a sentinel, an item that can provide vision of the enemy team, thus giving information about a certain area.\n*   Teams are usually referred to by blue, or red(depending on side of the arena).\n*   The game has a system of ranks, in which the diamond rank is one of the highests(only 2% top players reach it).\n<br>\n\nFirst, I want to clarify three time-concepts that we'll need during this analysis:<br><br>\n<u>*Early game*</u>: It's the term used to refer to the first 10 minutes of each match<br>\n<u>*Mid game*</u>: It's the term used to refer to the interval between 10-25 minutes of a match.<br>\n<u>*Late game*</u>: It's the term used to refer from 25 minutes within the match, till the end.<br><br>\nOf course, those definitions are all approximations, as the composition of champions and the skill gap between teams can heavily influence the lenght of each stage.\n\nThe dataset contains information from around 10.000 diamond rank matches, and the data was extracted when each game had a duration of 10 minutes(at the end of early game).\n\n---\n\nIf you're looking for a more detailed description of the dataset, check out it's link:<br>https://www.kaggle.com/bobbyscience/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min\n\n---\nHaving all said, let's import the modules we'll use and take a look at the dataset\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"goCdYe2Uzb0E","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom xgboost import plot_tree as plot_xgboost","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"nAmMcU7h62_z"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing the dataset and visualizing it with **pandas**\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"id":"Ypu3pPKm67fI","outputId":"44186447-e680-4764-83ee-13649d0d1077","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"filepath = '../input/league-of-legends-diamond-ranked-games-10-min/high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(filepath)\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Goal of the study","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict which team is going to win.

Our dataset doesn't specify that, which would, in my belief, increase our model's performance.<br><br>\n### Why did the first dataset(no feature engineering) performed better on most models?\n<br>\nAnother thing is that comparative variables(such as the subtractions we made at the feature engineering section) don't always tell you how skilled a team is compared to the other. For example:\n\n*    Match 1: at 10 minutes, team blue has 320 minions killed, and team red has 220.\n\n*    Match 2: at 10 minutes, team red has 200 minions killed, and team red has 100.\n\nin our dataset, both matches would have the same comparative value(100). However, the absolute values can also show how players are perfoming, or even the pace of the match(which is some hidden information about how well the composition does at early/late game). The duration of the match would also be a valuable information to have, giving us a better notion of how confident our model is on it's inference(the longer the match, the less confident it is).\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What valuable information can League of legends players extract from this analysis?\n<br>\n\n---\n\n### Gold is what matters.\n\nAs seen on the feature importance graph, gold difference is by far the most important variable for our model. The fact that Exp difference is the second most important, probably means that farming is one of the most efficient ways to earn gold(also, it gives you more experience at a lower risk). That probably means you should be paying more attention to farming and lane phase than getting kills.\n\n---\n\n### Don't forget elite monsters.\n\nOn the 3rd and 5th position, we have elite monsters. So don't underestimate them, those buffs really can change the outcome of a match.\n\n---\n### Blocking vision is just as valuable as setting vision.\n\nA surprising fact is that destroying wards is just as important as placing it. Leaving the enemy team blind is just as important as giving your team vision.\n\n---\n\n### Assists matter.\n\nThat doesn't mean that an assist by itself is that relevant to *gold difference*, but the meaning behind it: **play with your team**. Teams that are united usually get more kills, map pressure and objectives.\n\n---\n\n### Sacrificing yourself for an elite monster is not always worth it.\n\nElite monsters are important and can give you huge map pressure, but if that means having your entire team killed for it, maybe it's not that worth it. **Play smart**.\n\n---\n\n### Early game matters more than you think.\n\nA model with data only from the 10 minutes of a match can predict it's outcome with a 75% accuracy, what does it tell you?

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\nIn this notebook, we will analyze how the playing style has changed in NBA throughout the years.\n\nGenerally NBA players are categorized as follows:\n\n* Guards: These players are the ball handlers on the team. A team's offence runs through them. These are the shortest players on court. \n* Forwards: These players provide socring as well defence and are more physical than the guards.\n* Big-man: These players are the tallest on court and their main job is to secure the rebound and stop the opposing team from scoring in the paint.\n\nThroughout the years, each position had some specific skillset associated with it. But nowadays NBA is moving towards position-less basketball. Meaning, players are learning skills that were not associated with their position and are able to play in different positions as per the team requirement. This way defending a team becomes more difficult and challenging.\n\nFor example, look at the current Los Angeles Lakers team, Lebron James who is technically a forward plays the point guard and is the main ball handler of the team. Anthony Davis also sometimes plays as a Center and sometimes as a Power Forward."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nba-players-data/all_seasons.csv\")\n\n#revise draft data\ndf['drafted'] = np.where(df['draft_year'] != 'Undrafted', 1, 0)\ndf['draft_year'] = df['draft_year'].replace(r'Undrafted', np.nan, regex=True)\n\n#convert datetime\ndf['draft_year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['draft_year'])\ndf['season'] = pd.to_datetime(df['season'].str[:4])\n\n#add positions\ndf['position'] = 'NA'\ndf['position'][df['player_height'] >= 207] = 'Center'\ndf['position'][df['player_height'] <= 195] = 'Guard'\ndf['position'][(df.player_height > 195)&(df.player_height < 207 )] = 'Forward'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_corr = df[[\"gp\",\"pts\",\"reb\",\"ast\",\"net_rating\",\"usg_pct\",\"ts_pct\",\"player_weight\",\"player_height\"]]\n\ncorr = df_corr.corr()\n\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=np.bool))\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))\n\ncmap = sns.diverging_palette(250, 10, as_cmap=True)\n\nsns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5})\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This shows that big man have advantage of rebound, but players' size affects usg_pct and ast as negative.\n\nUSG_PCT means that the percentage of team plays used by a player while he was on the floor(FGA + Possession Ending FTA + TO) / POSS).\n\nTS_PCT is the measure of the player's shooting efficiency that takes into account free throws, 2 and 3 point shots (PTS / (2*(FGA + 0.44 * FTA)))\n \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Physical Aspects"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"byYear_height = df.groupby(\"season\").mean()[\"player_height\"]\nbyYear_weight = df.groupby(\"season\").mean()[\"player_weight\"]\n\nseason_list = []\nfor i in range(1996,2020,1):\n    season_list.append(i)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(16, 8))\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.05)\n\nsns.lineplot(season_list,byYear_height.values, ax=ax[0], label='Height')\nsns.lineplot(season_list,byYear_weight.values, ax=ax[1], label='Weight')\n\n# Add lines for different eras\nax[0].axvline(2000, color='#FF7F50')\nax[0].axvline(2010, color='#FF7F50')\n\nax[1].axvline(2000, color='#FF7F50')\nax[1].axvline(2010, color='#FF7F50')\n\n\nax[0].yaxis.set_label_text('Height [cm]')\nax[1].yaxis.set_label_text('Weight [kg]')\nax[0].xaxis.set_label_text('Season')\nax[1].xaxis.set_label_text('Season')\nplt.suptitle(\"NBA Players' Build\", fontsize=16)\nplt.legend(loc='upper right', bbox_to_anchor=(1.2, 1), frameon=False)\nsns.despine(ax=ax[1], left=True)\nsns.despine(ax=ax[0])\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The average height and weight of a NBA player show a declining trend through different eras.\nThis shows that players are getting more athletic and trying to add different skills to their resume, this leads to teams trying to utilize one player in multiple positions, making it the team tougher to defend.

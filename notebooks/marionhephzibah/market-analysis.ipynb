It is in 3rd place behind SP and GER in total sales\n\n#Question 3: Your supervisor insists that people who buy gold are more conservative. Therefore, people who spent an above average amount on gold in the last 2 years would have more in store purchases. Justify or refute this statement using an appropriate statistical test\n#Answer 3: Doing a simple linear regression model proves this is correct. The model shows that the average amount of gold purchased is 44~ and instore spending goes up with people who bought that amount(44~) and higher.\n\n#Question 4: Fish has Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for the brain.

We leave our work unlicensed, so you are free to do what you would like with it.**\n\nAs it stands, the weather forecasting paradigm has yet to be truly touched by machine learning. The Global Forecast System (GFS) used by the National Weather Service relies on mathematical models of the atmosphere, as does the forecasting model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Physical models rule over computer-learned models. In fact, it would be redundant for a program to learn an atmopheric model if we already know the model. Why teach software to do something that we can already do with supercomputing power?\n\nBut as hinted at above, these physical models are computationally expensive. Companies like [Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/03/a-neural-weather-model-for-eight-hour.html) have already produced work showing incredible speedups over state-of-the-art physical methods by engineering neural networks to predict local weather. The venture shows promise, but as of now, not enough is known about the efficacy of these methods for them to be implemented on a large scale.\n\nSo we posed the question to ourselves, \"Can we predict the current amount of precipitation based on other initial conditions?\" We hypothesize that we can, and that a proababilistic clustering model based on the HDBSCAN* algorithm will perform better than a k-nearest neighbors model at making predictions.\n\nBefore testing this, we will have to clean the data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# imports!\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xarray as xr  # easier handling of multi-dimensional arrays than numpy\n\nimport matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.pylab as pl\nfrom matplotlib import colors","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ### Radar plotting","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"directory = '/kaggle/input/meteonet/'\n\nzone = 'NW'\nyear = 2016\nmonth = 1\nsubmonth = 1\nnan_val = -1\n\n# rainfall files are located in a structured format, so we can easily locate them\n\ndef fetch_rainfall(directory, zone, year, month, submonth, ind=15):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns: rainfall data in xarray format, with coordinates.\n    \n    Precondition: directory is the directory to locate the file in, in string format\n                  zone is a two-letter string corresponding to a zone of the dataset (default NW)\n                  year is an int representing a valid year\n                  month is an int representing a valid month\n                  submonth is an int from 1 to 3, inclusive\n                  ind is the 5-minute period to plot\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    s1 = f'{zone}_rainfall_{year}'\n    s2 = f'rainfall-{zone}-{year}-' + f'{month}'.zfill(2)\n    s3 = f'rainfall_{zone}_{year}_' + f'{month}'.zfill(2) + f'.{submonth}.npz'\n    \n    filepath = directory + s1 + '/' + s1 + '/' + s2 + '/' + s2 + '/' + s3\n    coords_path = directory + 'Radar_coords/'*2 + f'radar_coords_{zone}.npz'\n    \n    # load the data\n    data = np.load(filepath,allow_pickle=True)['data'][ind,:,:]\n    coordinates = np.load(coords_path,allow_pickle=True)\n    \n    # uses spacial resolution of data (in degrees) to center coordinates\n    res = 0.01\n    lat = coordinates['lats']-res/2\n    lon = coordinates['lons']+res/2\n    \n    data = xr.DataArray(data,coords=[lat[:,0],lon[0,:]],dims=['latitude','longitude'])\n    radar = data.to_dataset(name = 'rainfall')\n    \n    return radar,lat,lon\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# testing the function to see if we can plot the data\nradar_test,lat_test,lon_test = fetch_rainfall(directory, zone, year, month, submonth)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure()\n\nif (np.max(radar_test['rainfall'].values) > 65):\n    borne_max = np.max(radar_test['rainfall'].values)\nelse:\n    borne_max = 65 + 10\ncmap = colors.ListedColormap(['silver','white', 'darkslateblue', 'mediumblue','dodgerblue', 'skyblue','olive','mediumseagreen'\n                              ,'cyan','lime','yellow','khaki','burlywood','orange','brown','pink','red','plum'])\nbounds = [-1,0,2,4,6,8,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60,65,borne_max]\nnorm = colors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)\n\n# take out nan values\nnan_radar_test = radar_test.where(radar_test[\"rainfall\"]!=nan_val)\n\nfig.set_size_inches(11,8)\nplt.imshow(nan_radar_test[\"rainfall\"].values,cmap=cmap, norm=norm)\nfig.suptitle('Rainfall')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load our time series","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ground2016 = pd.read_csv(directory + 'NW_Ground_Stations/'*2 + 'NW_Ground_Stations_2016.csv')\nground2016.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Manipulating the data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Wow, this dataset has 22 MILLION rows in just one year!

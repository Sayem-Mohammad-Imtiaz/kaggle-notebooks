This rating system works by assigning each team a score and then adding or subtracting points from that score based on the relative skill of the two teams. ELO ratings work well when you are playing a lot games against people with a variety of skill. Chess, is a good example of a game where this rating system works very well. ELO ratings are not so good for team games because the individual members of a team are constantly changing and therefore the current ELO rating may say more about skill of the previous team members as opposed to the current ones.\n\nFIFA uses this rating system to rank international teams, you can read this PDF: https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/edbm045h0udbwkqew35a.pdf for a detailed breakdown for how exactly FIFA's version works. My own version will make some simplifications like not weight matches based on significance. Before implementing this in Python I would like to describe the mathematics behind my ELO rating. (Skip to **implementation** if you just want to see the code).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Mathematics of the ELO rating system\n\n## Definitions\nLet $S^i_j$ denote the score of the $j$th team after the $i$th game. \\\nLet $R^i_j$ be the result of game $i$ for team $j$ and $E[R^i_{jk}]$ the expected result of the $i$th game of the $j$th team, where the $k$th team are their opponents. \\\nLet $g^i_j$ denote the number of goals that the $j$th team scored in their $i$th game. \\\nLet $n$ denote the number of teams in the ELO rating system. \\\nLet $w^i$ denote the weighting of the $i$th match (based on significance).\n\n**Important Aside** Superscripts in these formulas do not denote powers. They are simply indexes.\n\n## Initial State\nEvery team starts off with $1000$ points. Or more formally: $\\forall j\\in\\mathbb{Z}_n:S_0^j=1000$. \\\nAs stated in the introduction, the match weightings ($w^i$) are constant in my implementation. \\\n$R^i_j$ can take on one of three values: $1$ if the team wins, $0.5$ if the team draws and $0$ if the team loses. \\\n$E[R^i_{jk}]=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\lambda \\left(S^i_j-S^i_k\\right)}}$. This is a sigmoid function (close to one if $S^i_j>>S^i_k$, $0.5$ if $S^i_j=S^i_k$ and close to zero if $S^i_j<<S^i_k$). $\\lambda$ is some positive quantity that weights the difference so the expected value produces sensible scores.\n\n## Main formula\nIn words, the updated score of a team is their previous score plus the weighted difference between the actual result and the expected result. \\\nAs a formula: $S^{i+1}_j=S^i_j+g^i_j+w^i\\left(R^i_j-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\lambda \\left(S^i_j-S^i_k\\right)}}\\right)$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Implementation\n\nNow we have gone over the mathematics behind the ELO rating system, we will finally start coding.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\n\nimport os # Reading files\nimport numpy as np # Linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # Data processing \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Data visualisation","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Data\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/results.csv')","metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fix = df[['date', 'home_team', 'away_team', 'home_score', 'away_score']]\nfix.info()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Functions\n\nThis calculates the $R^i_j$ and $E[R^i_{jk}]$ value.

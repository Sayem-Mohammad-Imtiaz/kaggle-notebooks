Our objective is to classify the pateints who survived and who died after the treatment of 5 years.\n2. As we can see in our univariate analysis that the classes are heavily ovelapped, and therefore could not be seperated linearly in 1-D or 2-D dimensions. But could be seperated in higher dimensions.\n3. In the scatter pair plot an distplot we can see that the two classes are heavily overlapped and thus no assumption could be made by seeing these plots.\n4. In the case of the PDF and CDF plotting we can see that feature \"age\" is giving better result for classification as compare the other two. Using age as the parameter for classification we can observe that people who survived falls in the range from 35-65 while who died falls in the range of 40-80, although they overlap but it is better than the other two parametes.\n5. From the contour graph we can see that maximum number of people died and survived falls in the range of age between 45 to 55."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"15dbe160dddf5cbad967d70574b20fc539c82c3a","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom colorama import Fore, Back, Style\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/haberman.csv\", header = None)\ndf.columns = ['age','year_of_opr','no_aux_nodes','survival_status']\nx=list(df.columns[:-1])\nindex = 1\n\n#Pair Plots\ntext = \"PAIR PLOTS\"\nprint(\"*\"*25 + Fore.GREEN + Back.WHITE + text + Style.RESET_ALL + \"*\"*25)\ndf[\"survival_status\"] = df[\"survival_status\"].apply(lambda y: \"Survived\" if y == 1 else \"Died\")\nplt.close()\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nsns.pairplot(df, hue = \"survival_status\", size = 2)\n\n\n#Histograms\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nfor att in x:\n    sns.FacetGrid(df, hue = \"survival_status\" , size = 4).map(sns.distplot, att).add_legend()\n    plt.show()\n\n#PDF's and CDF's   \ndf_1 = df.loc[df[\"survival_status\"] == \"Survived\"];\ndf_2 = df.loc[df[\"survival_status\"] == \"Died\"];\nplt.figure(1)\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nfor att in x:\n    plt.subplot(1,3,index)\n    index = index + 1\n    counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(df_1[att], bins = 10, density = True)\n    pdf = counts/ sum(counts)\n    text = att + \"_of_people_survived\"\n    print(\"*\"*25 + Fore.GREEN + Back.WHITE + text + Style.RESET_ALL + \"*\"*25)\n    print(Fore.YELLOW + \"Probability Density Function values are:\" + Style.RESET_ALL,pdf)\n    print(Fore.YELLOW + \"Bin edges values are:\" + Style.RESET_ALL,bin_edges)\n    cdf = np.cumsum(pdf)\n    plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf)\n    plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf)\n    plt.xlabel(att + \"_of_ppl_survived\")\n    counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(df_2[att], bins = 10, density = True)\n    pdf = counts/ sum(counts)\n    text = att + \"_of_people_died\"\n    print(\"*\"*25 + Fore.GREEN + Back.WHITE + text + Style.RESET_ALL + \"*\"*25)\n    print(Fore.YELLOW + \"Probability Density Function values are:\" + Style.RESET_ALL,pdf)\n    print(Fore.YELLOW + \"Bin edges values are:\" + Style.RESET_ALL,bin_edges)\n    cdf = np.cumsum(pdf)\n    plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],pdf)\n    plt.plot(bin_edges[1:],cdf)\n    plt.xlabel(att + \"_of_ppl_died\")\n#BoxPlots\nindex = 1\nplt.figure(3)\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nfor att in x:\n    plt.subplot(1,3,index)\n    index = index + 1\n    sns.boxplot(x = \"survival_status\", y = att, data = df,)\nplt.show()\n\n\n#Violin plot\nindex = 1\nplt.figure(3)\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nfor att in x:\n    plt.subplot(1,3,index)\n    index = index + 1\n    sns.violinplot(x = \"survival_status\", y = att, data = df)\nplt.show()\n\n\n# contour plot\nsns.jointplot(x = \"age\", y = \"year_of_opr\", data = df, kind = 'kde')\nplt.show()\n    \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"da437c1210505f5ebbe111f1c546a6d55746cfab"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The objective of this notebook is to explore and exploit ECommerce data to recommend products to customers. The following analysis somewhat follows the popular method of recommendation - given a sample customer, find similar customers, then recommend the products they've bought which the sample customer has not. From what I've seen from other algorithms, the similarity score between customers is measured using a bitwise AND operation. Although these algorithms are fast, they disregard the number of each product the customer has bought. Using bitwise, customers who have only bought bottles and nails are measured as equals. Using euclidean distance instead of bitwise will measure them differently if they had bought different quantities of each product."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\nimport scipy.spatial\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt;","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.DataFrame({\n    'Customers': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'Bottles': [1, 1, 1],\n    'Nails': [1, 1, 1]\n})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"All customers are seen as equal using bitwise."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.DataFrame({\n    'Customers': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'Bottles': [4, 1, 5],\n    'Nails': [1, 2, 1]\n})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Using quantity as a distance measure we can see that customer C is actually more similar to customer A than B, for example.\n\nLet's explore this further..."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def showVector(vector):\n    plt.figure(figsize = (100,100))\n    plt.imshow(vector, aspect = 100)\n\ndef sigmoid(x):\n  return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))\nsigmoid = np.vectorize(sigmoid)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\n    '/kaggle/input/ecommerce-data/data.csv',\n    encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\",\n    dtype = {'CustomerID': str, 'InvoiceID': str}\n)\n\ndata","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the table above, each row is a transaction with a few columns that are of interest:\n- **StockCode** (the product)\n- **Description** (of the product)\n- **Quantity** (of products bought)\n- **CustomerID** (of the customer whom bought the product)\n\nThse columns provide the values that describe the relationship betwen the customer and their purchaces."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"customers = data.CustomerID.unique()\nproducts = data.StockCode.unique()\nnumberOfCustomers = len(customers)\nnumberOfProducts = len(products)\npd.DataFrame([{\n    'Customers': numberOfCustomers,\n    'Products': numberOfProducts\n}], index=['quantity'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"productTransactionCounts = data.StockCode.value_counts()\nproductPurchaseFrequency = pd.DataFrame(data = {\n    'Product': productTransactionCounts.index.values,\n    '#Transactions': productTransactionCounts.values\n})\nproductPurchaseFrequency.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"productQuantityTotals = data.groupby('StockCode')['Quantity'].sum()\nproductQuantityTotals = pd.DataFrame(data = {\n    'Product': productQuantityTotals.index.values,\n    'QuantitySum': productQuantityTotals.values\n})\nproductQuantityTotals.sort_values(by='QuantitySum', ascending=False).head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"customerQuantityTotals = data.groupby('CustomerID')['Quantity'].sum()\ncustomerQuantityTotals = pd.DataFrame(data = {\n    'Customer': customerQuantityTotals.index.values,\n    'QuantitySum': customerQuantityTotals.values\n})\ncustomerQuantityTotals.sort_values(by='QuantitySum', ascending=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The negative quantities are the purchases that have been returned.\n\n*Customer 14646 loves buying stuff!

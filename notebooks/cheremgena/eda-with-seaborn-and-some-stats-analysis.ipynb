Distribution of scores in male class has strikly a lot less kurtosis than in female class. There is in all score attributes.

Male class has more smoother peak in distribution.(Because maybe the most of men think that passing exams is a personal matter). By the location of the peak, we can say that men are better at mathematics, and women are better at language exams (it is consistent with the statement that men are better versed in technical sciences, and women in humanities)\n* About lunch. When people have standard lunch, they get better scores than people with free lunch. The brain works better at full nutrition.(But if people eat lunch normally, it means that they have more money. So they will have more opportunities for preparing better for exams. For example: expensive literature or expensive tutors).

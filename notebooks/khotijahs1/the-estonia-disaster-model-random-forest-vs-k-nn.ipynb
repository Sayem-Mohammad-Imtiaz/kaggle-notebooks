She departed at 19.00 carrying 989 passengers and crew, as well as vehicles, and was due to dock at 09.30 the following morning, Tragically, the Estonia never arrived.\n\nThe weather was typically stormy for the time of year but, like all the other scheduled ferries on that day, the Estonia set off as usual. At roughly 01:00 a worrying sound of screeching metal was heard, but an immediate inspection of the bow visor showed nothing untoward. The ship suddenly listed 15 minutes later and soon alarms were sounding, including the lifeboat alarm. Shortly afterwards the Estonia rolled drastically to starboard. Those who had reached the decks had a chance of survival but those who had not were doomed as the angled corridors had become death traps. A Mayday signal was sent but power failure meant the ship’s position was given imprecisely. The Estonia disappeared from the responding ships’ radar screens at about 01:50.\n\nThe Marietta arrived at the scene at 02:12 and the first helicopter at 03:05. Of the 138 people rescued alive, one died later in hospital.\n\nOf the 310 people who had reached the decks, almost a third died of hypothermia. The final death toll was shockingly high – more than 850 people.\n\nAn official inquiry found that failure of the locks on the bow visor, which broke away under the punishing waves, caused water to flood the car deck and quickly capsize the ship. The report also noted a lack of action, delay in sounding the alarm, lack of guidance from the bridge and a failure to light distress flares.\n\nsource dataset

Random Forest Classification\n\nBased on the previous classification method, random forest is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a forest randomly. This forest, is a set of decision trees, most of the times trained with the bagging method. The essential idea of bagging is to average many noisy but approximately impartial models, and therefore reduce the variation. Each tree is constructed using the following algorithm:\n\n* Let $N$ be the number of test cases, $M$ is the number of variables in the classifier.\n* Let $m$ be the number of input variables to be used to determine the decision in a given node; $m<M$.\n* Choose a training set for this tree and use the rest of the test cases to estimate the error.\n* For each node of the tree, randomly choose $m$ variables on which to base the decision. Calculate the best partition of the training set from the $m$ variables.\n\nFor prediction a new case is pushed down the tree. Then it is assigned the label of the terminal node where it ends. This process is iterated by all the trees in the assembly, and the label that gets the most incidents is reported as the prediction. We define the number of trees in the forest in 100. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) ?\n\nis a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression.[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)] In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:\n\n* In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n* In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.\n\nk-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation. Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically. \n\nBoth for classification and regression, a useful technique can be to assign weights to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones. For example, a common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor. The neighbors are taken from a set of objects for which the class (for k-NN classification) or the object property value (for k-NN regression) is known. This can be thought of as the training set for the algorithm, though no explicit training step is required.\n\n**\nExample**\n\n![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/220px-KnnClassification.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/220px-KnnClassification.svg.png)\n\n\nAs you can see above on the Example of k-NN classification. The test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle).\n\n\n**Parameter selection**\n\nThe best choice of k depends upon the data; generally, larger values of k reduces effect of the noise on the classification[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)] but make boundaries between classes less distinct. \n\n\n**The 1-nearest neighbor classifier**\n\n\nThe most intuitive nearest neighbour type classifier is the one nearest neighbour classifier that assigns a point x to the class of its closest neighbour in the feature space, that is ![https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f815904edbff2ce82502172ec0dce3311d57f2bb](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f815904edbff2ce82502172ec0dce3311d57f2bb)\n\nAs the size of training data set approaches infinity, the one nearest neighbour classifier guarantees an error rate of no worse than twice the Bayes error rate (the minimum achievable error rate given the distribution of the data)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Prediction"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## a.

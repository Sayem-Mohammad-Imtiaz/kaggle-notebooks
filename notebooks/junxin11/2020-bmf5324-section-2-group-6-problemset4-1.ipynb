For quick overview of what SIR is about, please check out: [The MATH of Epidemics | Intro to the SIR Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qrp40ck3WpI)\n\nThe SIR framework works on a population that is subdivided into three groups. \n1. [S] **Susceptible** group: people who are susceptible to Covid19.\n1. [I] **Infectious** group: people who are infectious.\n1. [R] **Recovered(aka removed)** group: people who are no longer infectious (i.e., recovered or died). \n\nThe key assumptions are:   \n1. A recovered person develops lifelong immunity after infection. While there is anecdotal evidence of reinfections and non-lifelong immunity, this assumption is not unreasonable for now. To model the possibility of reinfections, the SIR model can be augmented to the SIRS model, which allows recovered individuals to return to a susceptible state.\n2. The population remains constant, i.e, there are no new births and no deaths on account of reasons other than the epidemic.\n\n## A deeper dive into the SIR model\n\n * S: Susceptible = All - *Confirmed*\n * I: Infected = *Confirmed* - Recovered - Deaths\n * R: Recovered or died = Recovered + Deaths)\n \nNote that *Confirmed* is the cumulative cases of confirmed cases, which include infectious, recovered, and died patients. The **S** group declines with time and the **R** group increases with time. Whether **I** increases or decreases depends on the relative rate of change between **S** group and **R** group. If the rate of decline in **S** group (i.e., the rate in which people leave the **S** group to join the **I** group) is greater than the rate of increase in **R** group (i.e., the rate in which people leave the **I** group to join the **R** group), the **I** group will increase.\n \nThe \"R\" in SIR model is \"Recovered and have immunity\", but we define \"R\" as \"Recovered or died\". The mortality rate of Covid19 is non-negligible. Also, whether recovered patients acquire lifetime immunity remains an open question. If reinfections are prevalent, we should use the SIRS model, which allows people in the **R** group to rejoin the **S** group.\n\nThe big picture:  \n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathrm{S} \\overset{\\beta I}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{I} \\overset{\\gamma}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathrm{R}  \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n$\\beta$: Effective contact rate or transmission rate [per day basis]  \n$\\gamma$: Recovery(and mortality) rate [per day basis]  \n\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE):  \n\\begin{align*}\n& \\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}T}= - \\beta S I / N \\\\\n& \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}T}= \\beta S I / N - \\gamma I  \\\\\n& \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}T}= \\gamma I  \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\nWhere $N=S+I+R$ is the total population, $T$ is the elapsed time from the start date.  \n\nWhen the transmission rate exceeds the recovery rate (i.e., $\\beta / \\gamma$ > 1), the disease will spread (dI/dt > 0).

Increase the recovery rate (Gamma)\n\n**1. Reduce the susceptible population (S)**   \n\nVaccination is the key. With safe and effective vaccines available, the susceptible population will shrink. When the susceptible population falls below a certain threshold (typically between 10 to 30%), herd immunity may work. There are currently a handful of promising vaccines that are undergoing various stages of trials. There are even suggestions to use Polio vaccines, which activate general immune system (as opposed to specialized immune system), until safe and effective Covid19 vaccines are widely available.    \n\nTravel restrictions, lock-downs (e.g., national or regional), movement controls, etc., are useful in containing susceptible population.\n\n**2. Reduce the transmission rate (Beta)**\n\nTransmission rate is a function of the contact rate (i.e., the number of people from the susceptible population (S) an infected individual comes into contact with) and transmissibility (i.e., the probability that a contact becomes infected).\n\nTo reduce the contact rate, the key is social distancing. Effective measures include closures of school/office, suspension of public transport, contact tracing (to identify and isolate susceptible people), isolation of susceptible people, quarantine of infected/susceptible people, limits on gathering, etc.<br>\n\nTo reduce transmissibility, the key is higher personal and environmental hygiene standards. Effective measures include use of face mask, frequent hand washing/sanitizing, frequent disinfection of popular touchpoints, etc.\n\n**3. Increase recovery rate (Gamma)**\n\nTo increase recovery rate, the key is to develop a robust healthcare infrastructure and effective treatment methods. This is time and resource intensive.

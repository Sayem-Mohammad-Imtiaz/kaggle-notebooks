INTRODUCTION <a></a>\n\nWelcome everyone ! This is my first kernel. My main objective in this kernel is to put in practice the things I learn in data science and machine learning. The upcoming study is about finding the best machine learning to detect the presence or absence of malignant breast cancer tumors. It is therefore a classification problem. A second objective of this kernel is to learn more about breast cancer, and how data science can help.\n\nDisclaimer 1: this kernel is going to evolve through time. At first, the kernel will propose a basic method of machine learning to deal with the problem, and I will leave a lot of open questions (things that I truly don't know). As things go, I should be able to propose a complete study with an apropriate comparaison of the different ML algorithms, taking into account the relevant hyperparameters of the problem.\n\nDisclaimer 2 : like John Snow, I know nothing... about breast cancer, or biology / medicine in general. If I say stupid things in these areas, please do correct me.\n\nDisclaimer 3 : most of this work is based on the kernel of another Kaggler user, DATAI. Thanks to you.\n\nHere is something I read on Breast Cancer, it dates back from 2005 but quick readings suggest things didn't evolve much in the meantime :\n\n\"Breast cancer is a major cause of concern in the United States today. At a rate of nearly one in three cancers diagnosed, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women in the United States. The American Cancer Society projected that 211,300 invasive and 55,700 in situ cases would be diagnosed in 2003 [1]. Furthermore, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in the United States, and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women ages 40—59 [1,2]. According to The American Cancer Society 39,800 breast cancer related deaths are expected in 2003 [2]. Though predominantly in women, breast cancer can also occur in men. In the United States, of the 40,600 deaths from breast cancer in 2001, 400 were men [3]. Even though in the last couple of decades, with increased emphasis towards cancer related research, new and innovative methods for early detection and treatment have been developed, which helped decrease the cancer related death rates [4—6], cancer in general and breast cancer in specific is still a major cause of concern in the United States.\"\nSource : Delen, D., Walker, G., & Kadam, A. (2005). Predicting breast cancer survivability: a comparison of three data mining methods. Artificial intelligence in medicine, 34(2), 113-127.\n\n\nFrom this small extract, one can note that artificial intelligence has been around for a long time in the field of medicine. Early detection seems to be of paramount importance in order to decrease the death rate of cancer. Artificial intelligence could go further and help curing cancer, by tailoring specific treatments with the genome analysis of the patient (Precision Medicine, [7]).\n\n\nIn this data analysis report, the data comes from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.\n\nThis study is decomposed in six steps :\n#### Data analysis\n#### Data visualization\n#### Basic ML analysis\nIn this section I will insist on the proper way to estimate the generalization error\n#### Hyperparameter tuning\nComing soon\n#### \"I wanna be the very best\", Ash\nComing soon\n#### Conclusion\n\n\n# **Enjoy your data analysis!!!**\n\n\n[1] http://www.cancer.org/\n\n[2] http://www.komen.org/bci/bhealth/QA/q_and_a.asp\n\n[3] José M.

Basic Machine Learning Analysis\n\nOk. We are going to do some machine learning. The previous analysis gave us good insights on what should be relevant for our classifier, and it also comforted us in the possibility of having good results with a classifier. In this section I will give the general methodology of machine learning for a given classifier.\n\n# But let's start with the beginning, what do we want ?\n\n\"In a general classification problem, the goal is to learn a classifier that performs well on unseen data drawn from the same distribution as the available data; in other words, to learn classifiers with good generalization. One common way to estimate generalization capabilities is to measure the performance of the learned classifier on test data that has not been used to train the classifier. When a large test data set cannot be held out or easily acquired, resampling methods, such as cross validation, are commonly used to estimate the generalization error. The resulting **estimates of generalization** can also be used for model selection by choosing from various possible classification algorithms (models) the one that has the lowest cross validation error (and hence the lowest expected generalization error).\" \n\nText from : Rao, R. B., Fung, G., & Rosales, R. (2008, April). On the dangers of cross-validation. An experimental evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (pp. 588-596). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. https://people.csail.mit.edu/romer/papers/CrossVal_SDM08.pdf\n\nThis previous text / explanation can be found in many books as it is the very starting point of Machine Learning, yet I chose this reference because of the title : \"On the dangers of cross-validation\". The article states that cross-validation can no longer be trusted to prove the generalization of a model when we compare a high number of models together. In the present data analysis, we are not going to compare so many models together, so this specific danger doesn't affect us. However, keep in mind that cross-validation is not a perfect way to ensure a good generalization of your model. It can only give you an **estimate of the generalization**.\n\n## The first thing we want is a single performance criterion\nI am still new to Kaggle, but in the Kernels I browsed, I rarely saw any discussion on the choice of the performance criterion. All I see is \"accuracy\" everywhere. It seems to me that, when detecting cancer, other performance criteria could be introduced. Since we want to detect cancer everytime there is one, we might focus on having a good recall rather than a good accuracy or precision(https://towardsdatascience.com/accuracy-precision-recall-or-f1-331fb37c5cb9). **I'm going to use the recall as my performance criterion for the rest of this analysis. It might actually not be the best criterion, and if someone tells me why I'll update it.**\n\n## The second thing we want is a good generalization of our algorithm\nTo ensure that, we have access to the k-fold cross validation for instance. But I have some questions regarding this k-fold cross validation. First of all, how should we choose k to ensure the best estimate of the generalization ? Secondly, training the same algorithm with different random_states will lead to different results and impact the generalization error and everything that comes after (feature selection !). This proves that doing a single k-fold cross validation is erroneous (in our application) as it leads to stochastic results. I'll propose a methodology to solve this issue, but I'm not sure about it.\n\n## The less features the better\nFor a given performance criterion, would you rather have a machine algorithm with a performance of 97.01% and 5 features, or a machine algorithm with a performance of 97.02% and 500 features ? I'm pushing it to the extreme, but I never saw the number of features taken into account in the final decision of which algorithm is better. At some degree, being able to humanly understand your machine learning algorithm should be taken into account, shouldn't it ? Reducing the number of features, in our application, could simplify the work of doctors when detecting malignant tumors... **Right now, I don't know. Therefore, I won't consider the number of features as part of the performance criterion. However, features will still be selected in order to maximize the classical performance criterion (recall).**"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c7b2df4e-270e-4c94-8789-177f5e90ac46","_execution_state":"idle","_uuid":"a042df90ef7138d6f101463e93936119176bdc0d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this section, we will select feature with different methods that are feature selection with correlation, recursive feature elimination (RFE) and recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV).

At this stage, we still don't care about cross-validation.\n\nAs it can be seen in the heatmap figure **radius_mean, perimeter_mean and area_mean** are correlated with each other so we will only use **area_mean**. This first criterion is not backed up by data, but if I had to give a wild guess, I would say that experimental measures on area might have lower uncertainties than measures of radius or perimeter.

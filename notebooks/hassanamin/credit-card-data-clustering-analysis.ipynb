Unfortunately the colors of the plots change when this kernel is rerun - but here are some thoughts:\n\n* **Big Spenders with large Payments** - they make expensive purchases and have a credit limit that is between average and high.  This is only a small group of customers.\n* **Cash Advances with large Payments** - this group takes the most cash advances. They make large payments, but this appears to be a small group of customers.\n* **Medium Spenders with third highest Payments **- the second highest Purchases group (after the Big Spenders).\n* **Highest Credit Limit but Frugal** - this group doesn't make a lot of purchases. It looks like the 3rd largest group of customers.\n* **Cash Advances with Small Payments **- this group likes taking cash advances, but make only small payments. \n* **Small Spenders and Low Credit Limit** - they have the smallest Balances after the Smallest Spenders, their Credit Limit is in the bottom 3 groups, the second largest group of customers.\n* **Smallest Spenders and Lowest Credit Limit** - this is the group with the lowest credit limit but they don't appear to buy much. Unfortunately this appears to be the largest group of customers.\n* **Highest Min Payments** - this group has the highest minimum payments (which presumably refers to \"Min Payment Due\" on the monthly statement. This might be a reflection of the fact that they have the second lowest Credit Limit of the groups, so it looks like the bank has identified them as higher risk.)\n\nSo a marketing strategy that targeted the first five groups might be effective. \n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.5","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

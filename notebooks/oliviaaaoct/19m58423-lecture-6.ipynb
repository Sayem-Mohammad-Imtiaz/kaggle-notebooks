From the colored table, it can be seen that 2020/03/24 had the largest daily deaths, which were 9 persons.The number of deaths is very low if compared to other countries. The corona cases had the peak during the end of Feburary. After that period, the cases is decreasing drastically with time in March. After March, the number of  daily confirmed case are quite stable.

With new cases declining, life in South Korea is returning to normal. More importantly, the country has one of the world's lowest fatality rates at just 1%. Korean officials attribute this to** a strategy called TRUST: transparency; robust screening and quarantine; unique but universally applicable testing and; strict control and treatment.** There is one approach called **drive-through test stations**, which allow health workers to take swabs to test for the virus without people leaving their cars. This approach is quite effective and helpful, which is now being copied by other countries, including Canada, Germany and the U.S.\n\n**Reference: **\nTiang, J., Ma , D., Huang, S., & Han, W.

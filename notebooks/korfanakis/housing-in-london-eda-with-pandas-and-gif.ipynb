The topic of this notebook is the housing market of London in the years between 1995 and 2020. We are going to perform exploratory data analysis with the goal of discovering new information and answering the following questions:\n\n- How has the housing market (average house price and number of houses sold) changed over the years in different boroughs of London? How does it compare to England?\n- What factors affected it the most?\n\n<br>\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1. [Introduction](#Introduction)\n2. [Libraries](#Libraries)\n3.

It doesn't have to return something.\n- Decorate the plot function with @gif.frame, \n- Use a for loop to create a frame for each month, and append the result to a list (called 'frames' in our case).

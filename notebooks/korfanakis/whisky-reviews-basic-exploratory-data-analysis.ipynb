Whisky is distilled throughout the world, most popularly in Scotland, Ireland, the United States, and Japan. It comes in many styles and some countries have strict regulations regarding its production. For instance, a whisky can be classified as 'Scotch' if it is distilled and matured in Scotland for at least three years and bottled at a minimum alcoholic strength of 40% ABV ([Source](https://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/discover/enjoying-scotch/scotch-whisky-categories/)).\n\nWhether it's Scotch, Irish, Japanese or bourbon, whisky is the most popular drink in the word and can be enjoyed on its own or be used in cocktails. You can read more [here](https://www.thespruceeats.com/history-of-whisky-1807685).\n\n<br><br>\n\n**This notebooks** explores a dataset containing reviews of different bottles of Scotch whisky (simply whisky from now on). Specifically, we will:\n\n- gain insights on their price, age, alcohol percentage etc.,\n- compare different categories, \n- study the reviews given to each category, and\n- answer some interesting questions such as 'which is the most expensive bottle?' or 'which bottle is the best bargain?'."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Dataset\n\nThe dataset includes information about more than 2200 whisky bottles from Scotland and was uploaded by [thatdataanalyst](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando) on kaggle.

The most important things to remember are:\n- There are five categories of whisky: Single malts, Blended whiskies, Blended malts, Single Grain whiskies and Grain whiskies. The most common category in our dataset is Single malts,\n- Blended Malt whiskies receive a higher score on average,\n- Single Grain and Grain whiskies have on average a higher age and alcohol content,\n- World clouds can help us visualize (and summarise) the descriptions given for each whisky category, and\n- The `sort_values()` method allows us to look at the ‚Äòextremes‚Äô, and answer questions such as ‚Äòwhat's the most expensive bottle?‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat's the most alcoholic bottle‚Äô etc.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

The difference is while that one was about finding ARPAbetagrams for individual *words* this one deals with finding ARPAbetagram of *phrases*. This is much more computationally expensive so we will only be able deal with one phrase at a time, rather than a whole dataset. See the original ARPAbet-agrams and download the full ~135,000 word dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/valkling/arpabet-agrams\n\nFor reveiw, here is what an ARPAbetagram is:\n\n# Creating a New Word \"Game\"\nWe have all heard of anagrams, where you take a word or phrase and shuffle the letters to make a new one. However, I was wondering what if, instead of letters, what if we shuffled the words base sounds around. The ARPAbet is a set of phonetic transcription codes developed by Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the 1970s. It allows us to break down words farther into visual representation of speech sounds. Now what if we shuffled these around to make, what I am calling, an ARPAbet-agram. This is a bit more complex than anyone would ever care to deal with (It makes anagrams look pretty easy by comparasion). Calling it a word \"game\" is somewhat generous, but we can make a computer do all that teadious work to find ARPAbetagrams and we can just enjoy the results.\n\n## Defining a ARPAbetagram\n\nI will define an ARPAbetagram as a word (or phrase) whose formed by rearranging the ARPAbet phones of another. 2 additional rules:\n\n-The ARPAbetagram cannot be a homophone\n\n-Stresses can be ignored. Since I'm making this up, I can do that. It is like ignoring spaces or capitalization in anagrams. I find it makes for more interseting results. The ARPAbet-agrams are sparse enough without them.\n\nAs an example, the word 'accounts' has a pronuncation in ARPAbet as \"AH K AW N T S\" and the word 'countess' has a pronuncation in ARPAbet as \"K AW N T AH S\". Note that both words use the same phones (AH AW K N S T) so are concidered an ARPAbetagram of each other."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dictionary = open('../input/cmu-pronouncing-dictionary/cmudict.dict', 'r')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e1f75fc79126f3c3011805247a8e08b7070be3cd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Process ARPAbet dictionary\nFirst we'll reformat the dictionary into a Dataset with the word and it's pronunciation.

This is not to make *more* words to work with but rather make *less*. Many \"words\" in the pronunciation dict are not really words but rather common sounds. This was fine for the single word ARPAbetagrams because most words have only a handfull anyways so a few extra hits with sorta words and sounds is still kind of interesting. However, with phrases the results will be really massive without them anyways. merging the dict with this frequency one will filler it to words that are only common between the 2 datasets.

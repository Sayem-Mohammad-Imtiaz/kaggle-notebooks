It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. We will build a DT through a binary recursive partitioning, which is an iterative process of splitting the data into partitions, and then splitting it up further on each of the branches.\n\nUsing the decision algorithm, we start at the tree root and split the data on the feature that results in the largest information gain (IG) (reduction in uncertainty towards the final decision).\nIn an iterative process, we can then repeat this splitting procedure at each child node until the leaves are pure. This means that the samples at each leaf node all belong to the same class."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First,we invoke all required packages. \n* Numpy would be required as the input for many machine learning algorithms require data in numpy array form. \n* Pandas is useful with general data processing, manipulation, cleaning etc. \n* Sklearn provides various machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees\n* Seaborn is used to visualize data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\nimport sklearn.tree as tree\n#import pydotplus\nfrom sklearn.externals.six import StringIO \nfrom IPython.display import Image\n\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.metrics import auc\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve\nfrom scipy import interp\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#flights = pd.read_csv('../input/flight-delays/flights.csv')\n#flights_sub = flights.sample(n = 10000, random_state = 123)\n#flights_sub.info()\n#flights_sub.to_csv('flights_sample.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Original Dataset consists of 6 million records.

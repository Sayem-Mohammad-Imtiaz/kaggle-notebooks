So, wandering a little bit on the streets was enough to ask myself how much does it cost to live in a place like that. \n\nSpecially considering the well-known high density of buildings on the city, we may expect find interesting things by first analysing the sales prices of properties on New York. That's the purpose of this Notebook. Here, a 12-month dataset of Property Sales is analysed, involving the following features:\n\n* Location Features: Borough, Neighborhood, Block, Lot, Address, Zip Code and Geographical Coordinates;\n* Class and Category of the Building;\n* Physical Properties of the Building: Year Built, Land and Gross Square Feet, Residential and Comercial Units;\n* Sales Information: Sales Price and Sales Date.\n\nBy analyzing these features, we can define some goals for the Analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Objectives","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A good way to define some goals to be reached by an analysis, it's to define some questions, based on the features available, to be answered during the experiments done to the data.

Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS.\n\n* Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV.\n\n* The seven-day average of new cases topped the 14-day average in nine states and Washington, D.C., for Aug. 11, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins University data, suggesting that cases were rising in those areas. A month earlier, the seven-day new case average topped the 14-day new case average in 42 states and D.C.\n\n## Upvote My kernal If you like it\n\n# Map View","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from pandas import read_csv, Grouper, DataFrame, concat\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller\nimport statsmodels.tsa.api as smt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom keras.preprocessing import sequence \nfrom keras.models import Sequential \nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Embedding ,Dropout\nfrom keras.layers import LSTM \nfrom plotly.offline import plot, iplot, init_notebook_mode\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nimport datetime\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.api import ExponentialSmoothing, SimpleExpSmoothing, Holt\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nimport json\n\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ds=pd.read_csv(\"../input/us-counties-covid-19-dataset/us-counties.csv\")\nraw=ds.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\nwith urlopen('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/geojson-counties-fips.json') as response:\n    counties = json.load(response)\n\n\nfig = px.choropleth_mapbox(ds, geojson=counties, locations='fips', color='cases',\n                           color_continuous_scale=\"Viridis\",\n                           range_color=(0, 20000),\n                           mapbox_style=\"carto-positron\",\n                           hover_name =\"county\",\n                           zoom=3, center = {\"lat\": 37.0902, \"lon\": -95.7129},\n                           opacity=0.5\n                          )\n\nfig.update_layout(margin={\"r\":0,\"t\":0,\"l\":0,\"b\":0})\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"ds['date']= pd.to_datetime(ds['date'])\nds.Timestamp=ds[\"date\"]\nds.index = ds.Timestamp \ndf = ds.resample('D').sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Confirmed Cases in USA (Jan - Aug) üìÖ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=df.index,\n    y=df.cases,\n    name=\"Cases in USA\"     \n))\n\n\n\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    font=dict(\n        family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n        size=18,\n        color=\"RebeccaPurple\"\n    )\n)\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### üìå\n* Jan 22th -  1     case\n* Aug 14th - 5.32M  cases \n\n The count is exponentially growing.

To determine whether your time series data is a good candidate for Holt-Winters or not, you need to make sure that your data:\n\nIsn‚Äôt stochastic. If it is random, then it‚Äôs actually a good candidate for Single Exponential Smoothing.\nHas a trend.\nHas seasonality. In other words, your data has patterns at regular intervals. For example, if you were monitoring traffic data, you would see a spike in the middle of the day and a decrease in activity during the night. In this case, your seasonal period might be one day.\n\n### How Single Exponential Smoothing Works\nBefore we dive into Holt-Winters or Triple Exponential Smoothing, I‚Äôll explain how Single Exponential Smoothing works. Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) is the simplest exponential smoothing method. Exponential smoothing is just a technique for smoothing time-series data where exponentially decreasing weights are assigned to past observations. It is built upon the Na√Øve Method. With this method, the forecasted value is equal to the last observed value,\n\nHard to believe that Na√Øve would want to be credited with such a simple model, but it turns out it‚Äôs quite good at predicting financial data. Also, taking the percent difference between the actual and predicted values can be a good way to uncover seasonality.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"start = datetime.datetime.strptime(\"2020-08-15\", \"%Y-%m-%d\")\nend = datetime.datetime.strptime(\"2020-10-14\", \"%Y-%m-%d\")\ndate_generated = [start + datetime.timedelta(days=x) for x in range(0, (end-start).days)]\n\ndt=[]\n\nfor date in date_generated:\n    dt.append(date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"))\ndtd=pd.DataFrame()\ndtd[\"Date\"]=dt","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fit1 = ExponentialSmoothing(np.asarray(df['cases']) ,seasonal_periods=7 ,trend='add', seasonal='add',).fit()\npred = fit1.forecast(60)\npred=pred.astype(int)\ndtd[\"Holt\"]=pred\ndtd.Timestamp=dtd[\"Date\"]\ndtd.index = dtd.Timestamp ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Predicting for the next 60 days cases in USA","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=df.index,\n    y=df.cases,\n    name=\"Confirmed Cases\"     \n))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=dtd.index,\n    y=dtd.Holt,\n    name=\"Future Prediction\"     \n))\n\n\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    font=dict(\n        family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n        size=18,\n        color=\"RebeccaPurple\"\n    )\n)\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### üìå\n* By prediction on October 13th -  8.88M cases\n* based on the growth rate and Holt winter , we can see that it increases more than 8M after 6months \n\n##### It can be also get down if their is any change in the vaccine or lockdown get much strict means.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Would Continue...","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

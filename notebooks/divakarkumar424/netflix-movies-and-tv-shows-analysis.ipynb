According to a Nielsen survey in July 2011, 42% of Netflix users used a standalone computer, 25% used the Wii, 14% by connecting computers to a television, 13% with a PlayStation 3 and 12% an Xbox 360.\nWhen the streaming service was first launched, Netflix's disc rental subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription ( USD 16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month (USD 4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services. Netflix later split DVD rental subscriptions and streaming subscriptions into separate, standalone services, at which point the monthly caps on Internet streaming were lifted.\nNetflix service plans are currently divided into three price tiers; the lowest offers standard definition streaming on a single device, the second allows high-definition streaming on two devices simultaneously, and the \"Platinum\" tier allows simultaneous streaming on up to four devices, and 4K streaming on supported devices and Internet connections. The HD subscription plan historically cost USD 7.99; in April 2014, Netflix announced that it would raise the price of this plan to USD 9.99 for new subscribers, but that existing customers would be grandfathered under this older price until May 2016, after which they could downgrade to the SD-only tier at the same price, or pay the higher fee for continued high-definition access.\nIn July 2016, a Netflix subscriber sued the company over the price increases, alleging he was told by a Netflix customer support representative in 2011 that they would pay the same price in perpetuity as long as they maintained their subscription continuously.\n\nOn November 30, 2016, Netflix launched an offline playback feature, allowing users of the Netflix mobile apps on Android or iOS to cache content on their devices in standard or high quality for viewing without an Internet connection. The feature is primarily available on selected series and films, and Netflix stated that more content would be supported by the feature over time. Netflix will partner with airlines to provide them with its mobile streaming technology. This will start in early 2018 as part of an effort to get airlines to provide better in-flight Wi-Fi.\nIn 2018, Netflix introduced the \"Skip Intro\" feature which allows customers to skip the intros to shows on its platform. They do so through a variety of techniques including manual reviewing, audio tagging, and machine learning."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(r\"../input/netflix-shows/netflix_titles.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.index","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.count()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.columns ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"type = [\"TV Show\", \"Movie\"]\ntv_show_movie = data[(data[\"type\"].isin(type))]\ntv_show_movie.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.groupby('type').count()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(9,8))\nplt.pie(data['type'].value_counts(), labels = data['type'].value_counts().index, autopct='%1.1f%%')\nplt.title('Type of Content Distribution on Netflix')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Top20 content sharing country world wide on Netflix**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12,10))\nsns.countplot(y='country', data=data, order=data['country'].value_counts().index[:20])\nplt.xlabel('Content distribution No', weight='bold')\nplt.ylabel('Countries ', weight='bold')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = (10,6))\nsns.countplot(x = \"rating\", data = data , order = data[\"rating\"].value_counts().index[:14])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Rating of TV Show and Movie**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = (12,8))\nsns.countplot(x='rating',data = data,hue='type')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Top50 Movies**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"new_df = data.groupby([\"type\",\"country\",\"director\"])[\"listed_in\",\"date_added\"].max().reset_index()\nnew_df.head(50)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

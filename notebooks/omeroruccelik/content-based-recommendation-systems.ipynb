RS uses to a lot domains such as social media and e-commerce. Percent of 80 being watched movies and series on Netflix and percent of 60 being watched videos on Youtube has been explored by using thanks to recommendation systems. Amazon is in debt to recommendations systems percent of 35 of its gain. \n\nRecommendation systems are divided into three:\n\n* Collaborative Filtering\n* Content Based RS\n* Hybrid Models\n\nIn this notebook we are going to discuss content based RS.\n\n## Content Based Recommendation Systems\n\n* CB are the systems that create a recommendation system by capturing similarity relationship between items according to comments, description or attributes of items which users interact. \n* It is used to models such as TF_IDF and Word2Vec in order to capture similarity.\n* It is very powerful that a item adding newly is recommend. \n* CB Filtering Approachs always provides apparent recommendation in order to use content descriprions. For example, if users have never used items having specific key words, it has no chance of recommendation. \n* The reason for this, designed model is always the special the user at hand. So experience of similar users is not benefited. This tends to reduce the variety of non-ideal recommended items. \n* Other disavantage in CB, although it is so powerful for present item recommendation, it is not successful in new user recommendation. In general they create hybrid model by combining content based filtering and collaborative filtering.

We need to understand this topic in order to set up right recommendation system. So what is tf-idf?\n\nTF-IDF is a weight factor which a word display important into document and had been calculated with statistics method. TF-IDF method use to a lot domains (sentiment analysis, RS, stop words filterin etc.) This method is divided into two. Fistly we will analyze Term Frequency(TF).\n\n### Term Frequency\n\nIt express odds a word that is found document. For example \"Jandino: Whatever it Takes\" is a document. Odds of \"Jandino\" is 1/4 (number of Jandino / number of words in document)\n\n### Inverse Document Frequency\n\nIt express logaritmic value of the ratio number of document and number of the word that contains document.\n\n**TF-IDF method used as multipy TF value and IDF value. (TF * IDF)**\n\nI applied this method in my model. And I found between similarity with cosine distance.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 0. Introduction\n\nIn this notebook, we will explore various feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques in reference to the [Wisconsin breast cancer dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) on Kaggle. This dataset contains 569 breast cancer observations in which 357 of them are benign and 212 of them are malignant. The goal is to train a machine learning model that is able to classify a random breast cancer observation as either benign or malignant. I have chosen the random forest classifier for this particular problem but feel free try out other classification models of your choice.\n\nThe techniques that will be covered in this notebook as follows:\n\n- Variance inflation factors (VIF)\n- Univariate feature selection\n- Recursive feature elimination\n- Model-based feature selection\n- Principal component analysis (PCA)\n\nWe will compare the effectiveness of each technique by examining the accuracy of our model at making predictions. More specifically, we will be using the confusion matrix, which is a common approach to test the performance of a model in binary classification.\n\nI will include some additional resources at the end of this notebook to help you learn more about the concepts that are discussed in this notebook as well as links to my platforms and the other projects that I am currently working on. I hope you will gain some value out of this notebook.\n\nCheers\\\nJason"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

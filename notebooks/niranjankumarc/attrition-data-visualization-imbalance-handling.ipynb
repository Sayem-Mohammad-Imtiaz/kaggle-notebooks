The major hurdle was we had 1223 unlabelled (No in Attrition) and 237 labelled (Yes in Attrition), which is a highly imbalanced data. So I used stratified sampling based on proportion of attrition in overall data.\n\n> Model Evaluation: I have used the k fold cross validation technique for assessing how the results of a model will generalize to an independent test data set. I used k =5 i.e.. 5 fold cross validation. Model was fit on the stratified sample data and tested on unmarked dataset.\n\n> ROC Curve: The ROC curve is a simple plot that shows the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate of a classifier for various choices of the probability threshold. ROC area = 0.6128 and F1 = 0.81\n\n> Decision Tree Visualization: Used Python pydotplus package to visualize the decision tree to draw insights\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import the libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#using the seaborn style for graphs\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Read the dataset\nemployee_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"employee_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"##looking for any missing values\n\nemployee_data.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"employee_data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## basic descriptive statistics\nemployee_data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Mapping the attrition 1 - yes and 0 - no in the new column\n\nemployee_data[\"left\"] = np.where(employee_data[\"Attrition\"] == \"Yes\",1,0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"employee_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#supressing all the warnings\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Remove not usefull features"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def NumericalVariables_targetPlots(df,segment_by,target_var = \"Attrition\"):\n    \"\"\"A function for plotting the distribution of numerical variables and its effect on attrition\"\"\"\n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols= 2, figsize = (14,6))    \n\n    #boxplot for comparison\n    sns.boxplot(x = target_var, y = segment_by, data=df, ax=ax[0])\n    ax[0].set_title(\"Comparision of \" + segment_by + \" vs \" + target_var)\n    \n    #distribution plot\n    ax[1].set_title(\"Distribution of \"+segment_by)\n    ax[1].set_ylabel(\"Frequency\")\n    sns.distplot(a = df[segment_by], ax=ax[1], kde=False)\n    \n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def CategoricalVariables_targetPlots(df, segment_by,invert_axis = False, target_var = \"left\"):\n    \n    \"\"\"A function for Plotting the effect of variables(categorical data) on attrition \"\"\"\n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(ncols= 2, figsize = (14,6))\n    \n    #countplot for distribution along with target variable\n    #invert axis variable helps to inter change the axis so that names of categories doesn't overlap\n    if invert_axis == False:\n        sns.countplot(x = segment_by, data=df,hue=\"Attrition\",ax=ax[0])\n    else:\n        sns.countplot(y = segment_by, data=df,hue=\"Attrition\",ax=ax[0])\n        \n    ax[0].set_title(\"Comparision of \" + segment_by + \" vs \" + \"Attrition\")\n    \n    #plot the effect of variable on attrition\n    if invert_axis == False:\n        sns.barplot(x = segment_by, y = target_var ,data=df,ci=None)\n    else:\n        sns.barplot(y = segment_by, x = target_var ,data=df,ci=None)\n        \n    ax[1].set_title(\"Attrition rate by {}\".format(segment_by))\n    ax[1].set_ylabel(\"Average(Attrition)\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analyizing the variables\n\n- Numerical Variables"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Age"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# we are checking the distribution of employee age and its related to attrition or not\n\nNumericalVariables_targetPlots(employee_data,segment_by=\"Age\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- We found that median age of employee's in the company is 30 - 40 Yrs.

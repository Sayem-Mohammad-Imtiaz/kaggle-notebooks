It can be simply achieved by putting aside part of the available data (usually 20-30% depending on the data set size) and train the data on the remaining part. It is very important to use the test set as we would not have it. Data Scientists often unconscientiously make their decision after looking at the complete data set. This is called [data snooping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) and should be avoided. Check the awesome [Caltech ML course CS 156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEYAnnLazMU&list=PLD63A284B7615313A&index=6&t=0s) for very detailed explanation.\n\nHere, we will apply the split before encoding and scaling! Otherwise, we would scale the data using mean of the whole data set! In real-world applications, we will not know what the mean, standard deviation, or range of all features is! On similar note, imagine you would want to encode text data set. Fitting the encoder on the whole is a bit of cheating as we do not know in advance all possible expression that will pop-up in the future data. \nHence, applying train-test-split prior any processing steps, the test accuracy will more likely follow the out-of-sample accuracy. \n\nIn addition, the [train-test-split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) will automatically re-shuffle the data so we avoid the situation that we will train the model on \"sorted\" data set (for example, if the customer provide the data sorted by tenure)\n\nAfter the train-test-split, we would use \"[pipes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)\" to apply the same steps on train and test data set.

These non-numerical values are often called categorical values as they describe category such as 'internet contract' or 'cable contract'\n* For example, column containing 'no' & 'yes' values needs to be converted to numeric representation\n* There are also methods to process numerical values, e.g., [discretization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization_of_continuous_features) but these are applied only in rare cases\n\nThere are numerous ways/methods to encode the data as shown in the [category-encoders](https://pypi.org/project/category-encoders/) library. Here is the list of most common ones:\n\n### Label encoding \n\nLabel encoding will convert the categorical value into a vector of integers. The aforementioned 'no' & 'yes' would simply be converted to `[0,1]` list. Accordingly, `['no','maybe','yes']` will be converted to `[0,1,2]`. \n\n* **Advantages**\n    * Simple & memory-efficient (integer/binary vector requires only minimal RAM)\n        * Will not create a new features (=columns)\n    * Ideal for [ordinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number) categorical values\n\n* **Disadvantages**\n    * Not suitable for many [ML scikit-learn estimators](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#encoding-categorical-features), as these expect continuous input, and would interpret the categories as being ordered, which is often not desired\n        * Take for example linear/logistic regression with input `['red','blue','green']` converted to `[0,1,2]`. Higher number (`green`) would imply higher/lower effect (assuming positive/negative slope respectively)\n\n* **Examples**\n    * Experience of a candidate when applying to a job: need to sort `['junior','senior','lead']` would be `[0,1,2]`\n    * Product rating: `['ok-ish','good','very-good','perfect']` would be `[0,1,2,3]`\n        * Keep in mind that the input list is sorted/ordered!\n        \n### One-Hot Encoding\n\n[One-Hot Encoding](https://machinelearningmastery.com/why-one-hot-encode-data-in-machine-learning/) converts the categorical values into a vector of one-and-zeros. One is used at indices where a particular value exists, and zeros are used for all other columns. \n\n* **Examples**\n   * Colors: If we have a features with three possible colors `['red','green','blue']`, than rows with `green` will be converted to `[0,1,0]`. Similarly, rows with blue will be converted to `[0,0,1]` and consequently, `red` will be encoded as `[1,0,0]`\n       * Is not possible to have more than one color, hence, we will have only one `1` entry per each row\n   * Country codes: imagine we have customers from `US`, `DE`, `SK`, and `PL`. The one-hot encoding will create 4 columns. Rows where the customer is from `US` will look like `[1,0,0,0]`, rows with Germany/`DE` like `[0,1,0,0]`, and so on\n       * One could think of a different method to encode such column. For example, order the countries according to some criteria (e.g., distance) and use ordinal encoding.\n       \n* **Advantages**\n    * Introduces objective information independent of ordinal or non-ordinal nature of the feature/input vector\n\n* **Disadvantages**\n    * Suitable only for categorical values with relatively low number of unique entries\n        * Created many new features/columns which increases RAM demand\n    * May introduce [collinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) which is not desired in some models (see for example [linear regression](https://www.kaggle.com/mmdatainfo/linear-regression))\n    "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before applying the encoding method, have a look at the unique values available in each of the columns\n* Number of unique entries affects directly the shape of output/encoded matrix, see one-hot-encoding/disadvantages section"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# for visualization purposes, we will store the results in pandas dataframe and print the result in the next jupyter notebook cell\n# nr of unique: will count the number of unique entries\n# first 5 unique: will show first 5 unique entries (if less, only those)\ndfsummary = pd.DataFrame({\"nr of unique\":[],\"first 5 unique\":[]})\n\n# Run loop over all columns computing length (len) of unique entries in each column and converting first 5 enties to a string\nfor i in train.columns:\n    dfsummary = pd.concat([dfsummary,pd.DataFrame({\"nr of unique\":[len(train[i].unique())],\n                                                   \"first 5 unique\":[str(train[i].unique()[0:5])]},index=[i])],sort=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# join the result with metadata-column description\n# Will join on column name.

One of the most commonly used scaling techniques is [normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics), more specifically transforming the data set to unit norm (standard deviation of 1) and zero mean value. This process can be useful especially for ML applying transfer functions (activation functions in neural networks).  \n\nWithout scaling, these transfer functions do no serve their purpose. Imagine [Logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) converting input into 0 and 1 range output. Without scaling (setting the mean to 0, and 99.7% of range to +/- 3), all values could be converted to min/max, i.e., 0 or 1 even if the input vector would show \"normal\" variance but mean would be let's say -100 or +100 respectively. Scaling also improves numerical stability. Without scaling, the program could exceed the float precision (imagine multiplying ```1^10``` with ```1^13``` multipe times)\n\nFor more information, see [scikit-learn preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing) materials  \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# It makes, of course, only sense to apply scaling only to numerical values\n# Again, \"fit\" on train and apply/\"transform\" test\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nfor i in [[\"tenure\",\"monthlycharges\",\"totalcharges\"]]:\n    train_e[i] = scaler.fit_transform(train_e[i])\n    test_e[i] = scaler.transform(test_e[i])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"check_stats(train_e)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Imbalance<a name=\"imbalance\"/>\n[Class imbalance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis) is a common phenomenon in classification problems.

Here, we will show Decision Trees/Random Forest, k-NN, and SVM models. Check the [sklearn model comparison](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html) to see how various models perform in different situations (with different decision boundaries)\nFor metrics, see the prepared [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mmdatainfo/performance-metrics) and/or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)  \n\n# Decision Tree <a name=\"decision-tree\"/>\nMuch more detailed description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mmdatainfo/decision-tree)\n\n### How it works\nAt each step, find the attribute we can use to partition the data set to minimize the [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy), or [Gini impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity) (not coefficient) of the data a in the next step\n* just picking decision that reduced entropy the most at the current stage (=greedy algorithm)\n    * will not produce optimal tree, just one that will (somehow) work\n    \n#### Entropy<a name=\"entropy\"/>\n* is a measure of disorder in the data set. A quantity which will measure, in some sense, how much information is \"produced\" by a process (Markoff), or at what rate information is produced\n* Entropy is highest when every outcome is equally likely\n* Every time you remove equally probable outcome you introduce predictability and the entropy will decrease\n* **If the entropy decreases, we can guess the outcome with higher likelihood**\n* Information gain is a measure of the decrease in disorder achieved by partitioning the original data set\n* Information gain/entropy and **Gini impuritiy** are [almost identical](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/10228/gini-impurity-vs-entropy)\n    * In decision learning, it only matters in 2% of the cases whether you use gini impurity or entropy.\n    * Entropy (needed for information gain) might be a little slower to compute (because it makes use of the logarithm).\n        \n### Pros<a name=\"pros\"/> \n* Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualized\n* Requires little data preparation: **no data normalization** required \n    * however, balancing of classes is recommended (see disadvantages)\n* Able to **handle both numerical and categorical data**\n* Uses a **white box model**. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by Boolean logic \n    * By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret\n* Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model\n* Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated\n\n### Cons<a name=\"cons\"/> \n* Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalize the data well = **overfitting**\n    * **Random decision forests** correct for decision trees habit of overfitting to their training set\n* Decision trees can be **unstable** because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble \n* There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems\n* Decision tree learners create **biased trees if some classes dominate**. \n    * It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree\n\n## Random forest\nThe training algorithm for [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) applies the general technique of bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, to tree learners\n* bagging repeatedly selects a random sample with replacement of the training set and fits trees\n* outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees\n    * Can compute probability of the estimate as we have X trees \"voting\" for one result"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# select features & labels\nX_train, X_test = train_e.drop(columns=[\"churn\"]).to_numpy(), test_e.drop(columns=[\"churn\"]).to_numpy()\ny_train, y_test = train_e[\"churn\"].to_numpy(), test_e[\"churn\"].to_numpy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let’s compare the performance of one tree (`dt`), to a whole forest (`rf`).

If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor\n\n[Wikpedia example k-NN classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm): The test sample (green dot) should be classified either to blue squares or to red triangles. If k = 3 (solid line circle) it is assigned to the red triangles because there are 2 triangles and only 1 square inside the inner circle. If k = 5 (dashed line circle) it is assigned to the blue squares (3 squares vs. 2 triangles inside the outer circle\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/KnnClassification.svg/1280px-KnnClassification.svg.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/> \n\n### Pros<a name=\"pros\"/> \n* **simple** to understand and implement\n* kNN **works just as easily with multi-class data** sets whereas other algorithms are hard-coded for the binary setting\n* the non-parametric nature of kNN gives it an edge in certain settings where the data may be highly unusual, thus **without prior knowledge on distribution**\n\n### Cons<a name=\"cons\"/> \n* **computationally expensive** testing phase\n    * we **need to store the whole data set for each decision**!\n* can **suffer from skewed class distributions**\n    * for example, if a certain class is very frequent in the training set, it will tend to dominate the majority voting of the new example (large number = more common)\n* the accuracy can be severally **degraded with high-dimension data** because of the little difference between the nearest and farthest neighbor\n    * **the curse of dimensionality** refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings such as the three-dimensional physical space of everyday experience\n    * for high-dimensional data (e.g., with number of dimensions more than 10) **scaling** and **dimension reductions** (such as PCA) is usually performed prior applying kNN\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pca = PCA(n_components=0.999)# or set n_components=\"mle\"\n# As always, fit on train, transform test\nX_train_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_pca = pca.transform(X_test)\nprint(\"Nr. of features after PCA = {} (input = {})\".format(X_train_pca.shape[1],X_train.shape[1]))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tuning_parameter = {\"n_neighbors\":list(range(1,30,2)),\n                    \"weights\":[\"uniform\",\"distance\"]}\nknn = GridSearchCV(KNeighborsClassifier(), \n                   tuning_parameter, \n                   cv=cv,\n                   scoring=\"f1_weighted\",\n                   n_jobs = 10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"knn.fit(X_train_pca,y_train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"knn.best_estimator_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(classification_report(y_test,knn.best_estimator_.predict(X_test_pca)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n\nThis Jupyter notebook gives a very brief Introduction to Support Vector Machine (SVM).

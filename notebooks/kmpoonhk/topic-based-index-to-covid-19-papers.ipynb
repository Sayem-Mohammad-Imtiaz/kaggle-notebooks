The system cateogrizes papers to topics that have been automatically detected among the papers.  \n\nA hierarchy of topics is shown at the home page (see first picture below).  Each topic node can be expanded to show its child topics.  When a particular topic node is clicked, a list of papers belonging to that topic will be shown (see second picture below).  This can be used to find the papers for a particular topic.\n\nWe hope that the system can be helpful to researchers who wish to know what is in COVID-19 but do not have anything specific in mind to search for."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Image\nImage(\"/kaggle/input/20200416covid19/covid19-home.20200416.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Image(\"/kaggle/input/20200416covid19/covid19-z46.20200416.png\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

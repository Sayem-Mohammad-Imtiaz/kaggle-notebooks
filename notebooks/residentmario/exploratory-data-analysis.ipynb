See [the Wikipedia article][1] for more details.\n\nAlgebraic notation is a format for describing a sequence of chess moves. In algebraic notation the board is divided into a grid, of ascending letters and numbers. Every piece besides the pawn gets a letter. So for example  `e4 c5 Nf3` means \"white pawn to e4, then black pawn to c5, then white knight to f3. And so on.

In collaborative filtering, we can use one of two approaches to recommendation. Each one is an inverse of the other, and both are based on similarities between \"stuff\".\n\nIn the first approach, users are measured for the similarity between their ratings using some normalized distance metric. Then a new recommendation for a user is generated based on the weighed popularity of the items that similar users like.\n\n### Converting Implicit Ratings to Explicit Ratings\n\nLet's try this approach out. We already have users, but we haven't implemented ratings yet. Indeed, our dataset doesn't have so-called **explicit ratings**: our players don't \"rate\" chess openings on a five-star ranking system, for example. Instead, players are generating **implicit ratings**: they are choosing to use certain openings, or choosing not to use them, and those choices encode preferences, but not explicitly.\n\nTo proceed, we need to convert these implicit ratings to explicit ones. Since we're not building any serious system but merely demonstrating what is possible, let's use a simple exponential threshold approach. If a user has played `N` games, and used the opening in question more than `N / 4` times, then that opening is a five-star for them. More than `N / 8` is a four-star, more than `N / 16` is a three-star, and anything less than that is a two-star.\n\n*Warning: this cells has not been vectorized and so takes about a minute-and-a-half to run.*"},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"1aaa718e474b88a7dd953cb160db913c4c2709e9","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"e49dfc87-bf68-4d2e-95a4-ac9d585d8c4d"},"execution_count":null,"source":"import numpy as np\n\ndef threshold_map(n_opening, n_all):\n    if pd.isnull(n_opening):\n        return np.nan\n    elif n_opening / n_all >= 1 / 4:\n        return 5\n    elif n_opening / n_all >= 1 / 8:\n        return 4\n    elif n_opening / n_all > 1 / 16:\n        return 3\n    else:\n        return 2\n\nrecommendations = opening_used.unstack(-1).loc[:, 'times_used'].apply(\n    lambda srs: srs.map(lambda v: threshold_map(v, srs.sum())),\n    axis='columns'\n)"},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"28a372e50fb021562983eeb151834e40ce8bf006","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"0556eddc-f658-48ce-8872-30390da0e7e2"},"execution_count":null,"source":"recommendations.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"410d7116bd8c9fe3247a839af23bb18651f73d74","_cell_guid":"01671891-ae8d-470e-a7ba-c7f2fbdf8070"},"source":"This gets us a result which is relatively similar to what you find out \"in the wild\": a distribution dominated by 5-star ratings ([relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1098/))."},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"efc78398d6a6fcf09efdae3c825e2f8629ffbbb6","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"51e31f8b-4ae4-485c-a1a4-629c0ac6c80c","scrolled":true},"execution_count":null,"source":"pd.Series(recommendations.values.flatten()).value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"c9baf74f1ee97e5abcd5eb3ec9d173e788c8db1a","_cell_guid":"18205546-042f-4071-ae81-f6eaf9ab7e34"},"source":"### Choosing a Similarity Metric\n\nTo keep going, we need to know how to measure how similar two users are. One of the simplest metrics for measuring this is **cosine similarity**. To compare the similarity between two items (or users!) we do:\n\n$$\ns_u^{cos}(i_m,i_b)\n = \\frac{ i_m \\cdot i_b }{ \\left \\| i_m \\right \\| \\left \\| i_b \\right \\| }\n = \\frac{ \\sum x_{a,m} x_{a,b} }{ \\sqrt{ \\sum x_{a,m}^2 \\sum x_{a,b}^2 } }\n$$\n\nThe math is a bit intimidating, but the fundamental concept is relatively straightforward. Each of the possible items (openings) is a plane in N-dimensional space. High ratings contribute a lot of strength to the vector in that direction, low ratings contribute less, and null ratings contribute none at all. By taking the cosine of the angle formed between two of these crazy N-dimensional vectors, we get a \"distance\" that's between -1 and 1 (between 0 and 1 if the ratings are strictly positive)."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"b94173f4fa71092df666d232360a16c7d50406fe","_cell_guid":"6b8092de-8fda-49e6-8a49-bfcde0453a69"},"source":"### Executing the Model\n\n`sklearn` comes with a built-in cosine similarity metric as a part of the `metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances` function.

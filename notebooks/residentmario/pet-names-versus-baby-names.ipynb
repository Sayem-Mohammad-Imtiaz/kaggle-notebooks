However, the most popular pet names in the popular consciousness --- names like \"Spot\", \"Rex\", and \"Pluto\" --- are decidingly *not* human-sounding.\n\nCan we figure out which of these two \"kinds\" of names is more common in reality?","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d2efe8d2-d888-42c5-9a00-7b34adbff095","_uuid":"dbefe59bccaf7843d5595e8f79c80676fff6f1d6"}},{"source":"First, we need to import our data and coprocess it to find the overlapping dog/human names.

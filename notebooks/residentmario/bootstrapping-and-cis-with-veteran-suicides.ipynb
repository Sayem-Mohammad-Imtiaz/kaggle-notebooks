As I stated in the introduction, state-side suicide rates amongst veterans are highly elevated over those of ordinary civilians. We can use this dataset to understand *how much* higher they are by building a confidence interval (often shorthanded to CI) around the data.\n\n## Confidence Intervals\n\nYou may also want to read the [hypothesis testing](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/hypothesis-testing-with-firearm-licensees/) notebook. The salient point from that notebook was the fact that, due to the Central Limit Theorem, an estimator drawn more than approximately 30 times will have errors (deviations from the true value) that are approximately normally distributed.\n\nTo build a confidence interval, we first center on our estimator: in this case, the mean of the statewide suicide rates is an estimate for the nationwide rate, $\\bar{x}$. We then plug it into the following formula:\n\n$$\\text{CI} = \\left(\\bar{x} - t^*\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\bar{x} + t^*\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$$\n\nWhere $s$ is the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the dataset (the square root of its variance, a population parameter describing the amount of spread in the data); $t^*$ is the t-score; and $n$ is the number of samples.\n\nA standard normal distribution is centered on the mean $\\bar{x}$, with decreasing probability as we go further out to the left or right of the distribution. $t^*$ describes how far to the left and how far out on a standard normal distribution we are going to try to capture \"enough\" of the distribution to be meaningfully accurate. The more confidence we want to be in our confidence interval, the larger the interval will be, because the more cumulative probability we wil have to cover. This is an accuracy-precision tradeoff.\n\n$t^*$ is based on the amount of confidence we want to have (95%, 99%, etc.) and also on the number of sampes in the distribution. A distribution with a very low number of samples will have significantly longer intervals. In other words, the errors will be distributed according to the standard normal only in the case when the number of samples is large enough! In cases with very few points, a version of the normal with longer tails, the [Student's t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution), will be used instead. This limiting case, the standard normal, is what we can stick to in most practical cases ($n \\geq 15$ or so) however; it is also known as the $z$ score.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWith that jargon out of the way let's go ahead and write up a confidence interval!"},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"376c2e9c-8a4e-4d23-b534-87837cdfca23","_uuid":"a3ed7c1f1671efc6d05650462aaa8244b7e762c2"},"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nveterans_2005 = pd.read_csv(\"../input/2005.csv\", index_col=0)\nveterans_2005.head(3)","execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"56d1c7bc-bb5f-4e2c-863b-7db43f478ee1","_uuid":"3544738494c7655846de2168853545fab1abfe77"},"source":"df_2005 = pd.DataFrame(\n    {'vet': veterans_2005['vet_suicides'] / veterans_2005['vet_pop'],\n     'civ': (veterans_2005['all_suicides'] - veterans_2005['vet_suicides']) / \n            (veterans_2005['overall_pop_18'] - veterans_2005['vet_pop'])}\n)\ndf_2005.head(3)","execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"92ada930-7eaa-4210-be53-a31cf30f5de8","_uuid":"2edfc015bdf15d5d6c8ea78678a0b67a20bd9fd0"},"source":"The formula is relatively straightforward to implement, though finding the $t$ slash $z$ score requires a table lookup in `scipy`."},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9147d049-ad92-4f75-80ea-3f3e8397ef0a","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"e7e4f9c767290ffbadfe1f736f448bb8bc0364b9"},"source":"import scipy.stats as st\n\ndef confidence_interval(X, c):\n    x_bar = np.mean(X)\n    z_score = st.norm.ppf(1 - ((1 - c) / 2))\n    sqrt_n = np.sqrt(len(X))\n    std_dev = np.std(X)\n    \n    delta = z_score * (std_dev / sqrt_n)\n    return np.array([x_bar - delta, x_bar + delta])","execution_count":40},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"de5a8eb2-0b1c-4405-903c-0d3b069bf67f","_uuid":"d6ce4b31c283121958ae88521935ab52addc031d"},"source":"Here are our 95% confidence intervals for suicide rates in 2005 for civilian and veteran populations, respectively."},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ab848a81-1066-4969-8835-692f88178a03","_uuid":"8115baf27ac669a032bcbd49db1e59f716edadc5"},"source":"confidence_interval(df_2005.civ, 0.95)","execution_count":41},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4c68a07d-cc25-4f6e-bab5-cb10f6b014b1","_uuid":"2ec8654c9eb6a86bc3e28b0fe996780d2d6a55b9"},"source":"confidence_interval(df_2005.vet, 0.95)","execution_count":42},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f70a4c9f-6cd9-45cb-b068-5acb194ed5f5","_uuid":"51cefbeb2fd1699ba41c997975df0a560f782682"},"source":"You can clearly see a *very* large difference in these confidence intervals.

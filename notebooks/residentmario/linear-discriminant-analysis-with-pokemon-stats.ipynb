Dimensionality reduction is the reduction of a dataset from $n$ variables to $k$ variables, where the $k$ variables are some combination of the $n$ variables that preserves or maximizes some useful property of the dataset. In the case of Linear Discriminant Analysis, the new variables are chosen (and the data reprojected) in a way that maximizes the _linear separability_ of a certain set of classes in the underlying data.\n\nIn other words, given a dataset with $n$ variables, including an embedded set of labels that we want to predict, we can apply LDA to the data and reduce it to $k$ components, where those components are chosen in such a way that they maximize our ability to \"draw lines\" to distinguish the classes.\n\nSo for example, an ideal application of a two-component LDA reduction will look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BERGLQv.png)\n\nThe technique was originally introduced by Fischer himself in the 1930s, making it one of the oldest techniques in the book.\n\nAn LDA transform is useful as a preprocessing step when modeling classes because it transforms the space in such a way that algorithms which then go and draw those boundaries, like support vector machines, perform much better on the transformed data than on the original projections.\n\nHowever, it is also useful as an EDA technique. In this application, LDA can be compared to PCA. PCA is another dimensionality reduction technique (which I cover in detail in [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/dimensionality-reduction-and-pca-for-fashion-mnist/)) that creates new variables that maximize the *variance* of the underlying dataset. As such, it functions in the absence of data labels (it is an unsupervised technique). LDA, meanwhile, is based on categorical labels, and creates new variables that maximize the *linear distinguishability* of the underlying dataset.\n\nPCA is an interesting technique to try out on a broad variety of datasets because it will teach us how the variables are interact with one another, finding axes in the dataset which make intrinsic sense and might potentially even be worth creating new features for.\n\nWhen we have meaningfully labelled data, LDA is another great technique to try out. Applying LDA to a dataset will tell us how linearly separable our dataset is (which, depending on the context, may also be a commentary on howmeaningful our labels are). That, in turn, is a good marker of how hard we will have to work to generate a model with reasonable classification performace. Furthermore, by looking at what variables load highly, we can determine what elements of the dataset are the strongest signals for each of our classes\n\n## Mathematics\n\nA mathematical sketch of LDA is as follows. Suppose that $f_k(x)$ is the conditional probability that a point with features $x$ is in the class $G=k$. Let $\\pi_k$ is be the probability that any one of these classes will occur (e.g. so that $\\sum_k \\pi_k  = 1$).\n\nBaye's theorem holds that:\n\n$$P(G=k \\: | \\: X=x) = \\frac{f_k(x)\\pi_k}{\\sum_{k} f_k(x) \\pi_k}$$\n\nAssume that all of the classes have a common covariance matrix ($\\sum_k = \\sum_k \\forall k$) and that the classes are distributed as multivariate Gaussian distributions (e.g. each class of points is distributed normally across each of the $n$ variables).\n\nThen we may look at the [log-odds](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/logistic-regression-with-wta-tennis-matches/) of two classes ($k$ and $l$), and find that:\n\n$$\\log{\\frac{P(G=k\\: | \\: X=x)}{P(G=l \\: | \\: X=x)}} = \\log{\\frac{f_k(x)}{f_k(x)}} + \\log{\\frac{\\pi_k}{\\pi_l}}$$\n$$= \\log{\\frac{\\pi_k}{\\pi_l} - \\frac{1}{2}(\\mu_k + \\mu_l)^T \\sum^{-1}(\\mu_k - \\mu_l)} + x^T \\sum^{-1}(\\mu_k - \\mu_l)$$\n\nWhat this all means mathematically is unimportant. What matters is that, due to the equal covariance matrix condition, the math simplifies to an equation linear in $x$ (the last line). Thus this is a statement that, given multivariate normal distributions with a common covariance matrix, the log-odds between any two classes is a linear function.\n\nThat in turn implies that the decision boundaries between any $k$ and $l$ (the set $\\{x \\: | \\: P(G=k|X=x) = P(G=l|X=x)\\}$, e.g. the set of points such that the probability of a point being in either one of these classes is 50/50) is linear as well. Convexity in turn implies that the separators between the classes are hyperplanes. Hence the optimal solution for this classification problem will be:\n\n$$G(x) = \\text{argmax}_k\\left(\\delta_k (x) = x^T \\sum^{-1} \\mu_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_k^T \\sum^{-1} \\mu_k + \\log{\\mu_k}\\right)$$\n\nWhich is a convex function of $x$, and hence can be proveably solved using [gradient descent](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/gradient-descent-with-linear-regression/) or related optimization algorithms.\n\nSo for the given set of conditions (Gaussian distributions and equal covariance matrices), LDA remaps the data to an ideally linearly separable space. These conditions are rarely met in practice exactly, but many classification task datasets are \"close enough\" to separability that LDA is a useful technique to try out on them.\n\n## Application\n\nIn this notebook we will try out using LDA for exploring the Pokemon dataset. Our goal is to predict the type of Pokemon based only on its stat totals.

LDA does not provide this attribute.

The magnitudes of the components in the `coef_` tell us how heavily each of the features loads towards the seperability of that class.\n\nIf a particular class has a particularly high-magnitude coefficient (direction, positive or negative, notwithstanding) then that variable signals that class very well. That variable will factor very heavily into the LDA preprojection. A low-magnitude coefficient, meanwhile, corresponds with a weak signal, and hence will be mostly rubbed out in the reprojection.\n\nIf a class has mostly low-magnitude coefficients, that means that it is not easily linearly separable!

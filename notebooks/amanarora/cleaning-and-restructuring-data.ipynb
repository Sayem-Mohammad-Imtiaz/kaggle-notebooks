People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over 30 ; the range 25â€“30  is defined as overweight. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis, and depression.\n\nHere we look at the WHO adults' obesity dataset for each country from 1975 to 2016.\n\nThe metric used is percentage of adults who have Body Mass Index (BMI) >= 30.\n\n### **Update**:\n\nThanks to [Ran.Krish](https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh) and [AndrewHou](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewhou) for the explanation about the estimate range within brackets in the data.\n\nI'll quote them here\n\n> It is probably a confidance interval, ill try to explain.\nResearchers can't know exactly what is the obesity rate so they compute a confidance interval (usually 95%), it means that we are 95% confident that the obesity rate in every sample (of the same size) in this specific country will be between 0.2 and 1.1\n\n> Thanks ,you did a great explaining.\nLet me just add this for people without Statistical backgrounds.\nResearchers aren't able to ask every person to compute the exact number of Obesity %, it would cost a lot of money.\nso they just use sampling methods, for example, ask 10% people of every cities ( saturated sampling).\n0.5 is the point estimation.\n0.2~1.1 is the interval estimation, which means researchers are 95% or so confident that the REAL obesity% is between 0.2~1.1","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

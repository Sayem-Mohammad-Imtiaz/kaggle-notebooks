fighters have very similar static data.

Even though McGregor has achieved more championship success in the UFC, he only has 13 total UFC fights compared to 24 for Poirier. This is partially due to the fact that Poirier started fighting in the UFC before McGregor, and McGregor's lack of activity over the past few years. The second significant advantage in the static data is a two inch reach advantage for McGregor.

Another popular narrative among UFC experts is that Poirier will have an edge in rounds 4 and 5 due to McGregor's lack of cardio. However, according to the data McGregor actually has more experience training for full 5 round bouts in the UFC. I believe McGregor hasn't been able to properly showcase his cardio since he tends to finish his fights in earlier rounds, and it seems reasonable to assume that McGregor should have decent cardio since he has prepared for so many 5 round bouts in the past.

Poirier clearly has many avenues to victory, while McGregor has had a very high rate of success with strikes from distance. I believe this fight will come down to whether or not McGregor can maintain his output in the later rounds and if Poirier can have success getting McGregor to the ground. I believe both fighters have a relatively high likelihood of winning by knockout or decision, but I believe Poirier could also get it done via submission.\n\n*P.S.*\n\nDo you believe there will be a fourth fight between Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor in the future since the fight ended prematurely due to an injury? If so, comment if you would like to me to do another analysis before their next fight or any other upcoming UFC fights.","metadata":{}}]}

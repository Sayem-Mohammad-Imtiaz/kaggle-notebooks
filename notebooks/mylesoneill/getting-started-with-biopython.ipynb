The basic problem is the meaning of the letters in a sequence are context dependent - the letter “A” could be part of a DNA, RNA or protein sequence. Biopython uses alphabet objects as part of each Seq object to try to capture this information - so comparing two Seq objects could mean considering both the sequence strings and the alphabets.\n\nFor example, you might argue that the two DNA Seq objects Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.unambiguous_dna) and Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.ambiguous_dna) should be equal, even though they do have different alphabets. Depending on the context this could be important.\n\nThis gets worse – suppose you think Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.unambiguous_dna) and Seq(\"ACGT\") (i.e. the default generic alphabet) should be equal. Then, logically, Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.protein) and Seq(\"ACGT\") should also be equal. Now, in logic if A=B and B=C, by transitivity we expect A=C. So for logical consistency we’d require Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.unambiguous_dna) and Seq(\"ACGT\", IUPAC.protein) to be equal – which most people would agree is just not right. This transitivity also has implications for using Seq objects as Python dictionary keys.\n\nNow, in everyday use, your sequences will probably all have the same alphabet, or at least all be the same type of sequence (all DNA, all RNA, or all protein).

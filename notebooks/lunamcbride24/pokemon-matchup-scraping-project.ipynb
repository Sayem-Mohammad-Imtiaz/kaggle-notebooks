Interestingly, Fighting is on both the super effective and non effective top threes. This shows that, while the beginning analysis emphasized types for more general usage, the super effective and non effective categories are for more specific usage. The fighting type likely is on here due to ghosts being immune to it, thus being it was not very high on the general usage graph but having highs on both the specific effectiveness graphs. \n\nThe biggest one on here is grass, which makes sense with seven types that resist its moves. That makes it less generally versitile. The tradeoff, however, is being strong against water types, which is the most abundant type in all of Pokemon. This means it has very specific usage, and thus this methodology weighs heavily against the type.

There are more factors than just type effectiveness. Pokemon stats, move damage, move effects, held item, and abilites will most definitely change what type of move is likely to be used on a case by case basis. This also assumes that any Pokemon in the current Galar dex can appear in any battle with equal probability, which is not true by modern battle standards.\n\nThe point of using this data, however, was not to compare all these different factors to determine the best overall choices. It was instead to compare type matchups and move types for a more general appeal. Of course Pokemon like Cinderace and Togekiss are going to come out more given their popularity and thus they are bigger threats to keep in mind, but knowing the more general use case and preparing accordingly can help for Pokemon that might not be within the popular picks club. This is actually the point of why I wanted to look at type matchup data in this way specifically. Watching the top players go against similar choices is not nearly as interesting as when someone picks an unusual Pokemon, thus putting emphasis onto what general use moves they have to counter the edge cases. \n\nThose general use move types being Flying, Rock, and Fire.

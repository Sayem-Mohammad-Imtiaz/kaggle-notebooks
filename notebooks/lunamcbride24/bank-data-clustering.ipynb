A bank makes money from roping people in for longer amounts of time as well as when making purchases.

This tells me that the bank's marketing strategy should focus more on getting users to deposit more and pay more. I had also noticed previously that most of this dataset is pretty high in tenure, so a strong strategy in targeting new people is offering benefits based on how much they deposit into the bank. As for payments, these are likely to be referring to credit card payments in this dataset. Since payments increase with increased credit use, building trust in the bank to be willing to use that much credit seems like a strong strategy in that regard."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Introduction**\nBy 2023 at least 27% of the electricity produced has to be renewable. We aim to research if these goals are realistic & research the current electricity in different places of The Netherlands. We aim to answer questions such as:\n\n\n**(a)** How much per cent of all consumed electricity is renewable?<br>\n**(b)** Where is the most renewable electricity produced & how does this grow over time?<br>\n**(c)** Will the renewable electricity trend keep up with the electricity usage trend?<br>\n\n<a id=\"Hypotosis\"></a>\n## 1.1 Hypotosis\n\nBefore researching I try to predict the outcome of this research. With my research, I try to confirm or deny my assumptions.\n\n**(a)** How many per cent of all consumed electricity is renewable?<br>\nI expect renewable electricity production to be very little compared to the non-renewable electricity usage.<br>\n**(b)** Where is the most renewable electricity produced & how does this grow over time?<br>\nI expect the most renewable electricity/connection to be produced outside of major cities. Since it looks like people in rural areas have bigger houses and thus more space for PVs.<br>\n**(c)** Will the renewable electricity trend keep up with the electricity usage trend?<br>\nI suspect that renewable electricity grows harder compared to net electricity consumptions since electronics get more efficient & generating renewable electricity gets more affordable.<br>\n\n<a id=\"setup\"></a>\n## 1.2 Setting up libraries","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport glob\nimport base64\nimport folium\nimport imageio\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom IPython import display\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n\nsns.set_theme()\n\n# Configuration\nELECTRICITY_PATH = '/kaggle/input/dutch-energy/Electricity/'\nPOSTCODE2_PATH = '/kaggle/input/postalcodes2/postcodes2_2020.csv'\n\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-17T19:43:30.612582Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-17T19:43:30.613015Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-17T19:43:30.624071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-17T19:43:30.61298Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-17T19:43:30.622932Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.3 Load & Process\n<a id=\"loadnprocess\"></a>\nThe data set supplied is divided into files that are categorized by supplier and year.

The analysis will use different classification techniques and compare which classifier make the best prediction for this dataset.\n\nThe second part of the analysis will perform a regression analysis using only the students that get job to find out some of the key factors that influence the salary of an offer. The analysis are performed in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Various techniques that are used in this analysis are:\n\n- Explorary data analysis\n- Random forest regressor and classifier\n- Logistic regression classifier\n- Multiple linear regression\n\n\n## Loading data and libraries\n\nThe analysis starts with loading data and necessary library.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load necessary library\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import StrMethodFormatter\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mtick\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nplt.style.use('seaborn')\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# set default plot size\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (15,8)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data loading and cleanning","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load and preview data \nrecruit = pd.read_csv(\"../input/factors-affecting-campus-placement/Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv\")\nrecruit.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# drop id column\nrecruit.drop('sl_no',axis=1,inplace=True)\nrecruit.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summary Statistics\nrecruit.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check each column for nas\nrecruit.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After we load the data, we can see that there are 215 observations and 14 columns in this dataset with a mix of categorical and numeric variables.

There are other binary variables such as **gender**, **workex** need to transfer into 0 and 1 later in the analysis. Other categorical variables with multiple levels, we'll use *One Hot Encoding* to transfer to binary variables. Also, the first column **sl_no** will be dropped from the dataset as it's an index column.\n\nBy the first glance of the dataset, it's pretty clean. There's no missing values other that the salary for those who wasn't offered a job. Thus **salary** will be excluded in the first part of the analysis (Classification).\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization\n\nAfter we get the first look at the data, we'd like to get a better understanding by performing some EDA and data visualizations.\n\nWe first start with a pairplot from the `seaborn` library using `sns.pariplot()`. This will give us the correlation of all numeric variables in the dataset. We've also set `hue = 'status'` to see how the value distribute under different status. This can help us better identify variables later in the classifier.\n\nFrom the plot, we can see that the following variables might be significantly different under different student status\n\n- ssc_p: Secondary Education percentage- 10th Grade\n- degree_p: Degree Percentage\n\nOther variables shows different distribution under different status as well.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.pairplot(recruit.drop('salary',axis=1),hue = 'status')\n\n# gender             0\n# ssc_p              0\n# ssc_b              0\n# hsc_p              0\n# hsc_b              0\n# hsc_s              0\n# degree_p           0\n# degree_t           0\n# workex             0\n# etest_p            0\n# specialisation     0\n# mba_p              0\n# status             0\n# salary            67","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We then want to see the student status by gender.

This system contains lymph fluid and lymph nodes, which occur in critical areas in the body. Cancer cells sometimes enter and build up in the lymph system.\n\nLymph nodes are responsible for filtering lymph fluid and detecting chemical changes that signal an infection is present. When these filter points are in the armpit, doctors call them axillary lymph nodes.\n\nAs axillary lymph nodes are near the breasts, they are often the first location to which breast cancer spreads if it moves beyond the breast tissue.\n\nThe number of axillary lymph nodes can vary from person to person, ranging from five nodes to more than 30.\n\nAfter a breast cancer diagnosis, a doctor will often check whether cancer cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This can help confirm the diagnosis and staging of the cancer. Breast cancer can spread to any lymph nodes. Most often, it spreads to the axillary lymph nodes first (in the armpit), and then to the nodes in the collarbone (clavicular) or the breast (internal mammary).\n","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzeBrb6NEnFoChpSGveToFeBwLOU8dD2/view\n\n# original_df = pd.read_csv('../input/haberman.csv', names=['age', 'year', 'nodes', 'status'])\noriginal_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohan-paul/Multiple-Dataset/main/Haberman/haberman.csv', names=['age', 'year', 'nodes', 'status'] )\noriginal_df.head()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"original_df.shape\n","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"original_df['status'].value_counts()\noriginal_df.head(10)","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"original_df.info()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Panda Profiling\nQuickly do an exploratory data analysis with Pandas profiling module.

The probability of observing any single value is equal to 0 since the number of values which may be assumed by the random variable is infinite. For example, a random variable X may take all values over an interval of real numbers. Then the probability that X is in the set of outcomes A,P(A), is defined to be the area above A and under a curve. The curve, which represents a function p(x), must satisfy the following:\n\n1: The curve has no negative values (p(x)>0 for all x)\n\n2: The total area under the curve is equal to 1.\n\nA curve meeting these requirements is often known as a density curve. Some examples of continuous probability distributions are normal distribution, exponential distribution, beta distribution, etc.\n\nThere’s another type of distribution that often pops up in literature which you should know about called cumulative distribution function. All random variables (discrete and continuous) have a cumulative distribution function. It is a function giving the probability that the random variable X is less than or equal to x, for every value x. For a discrete random variable, the cumulative distribution function is found by summing up the probabilities.\n\nUnless you are implementing these functions yourself, all these functions are available in `scipy.stats.norm`\n\ne.g. for cdf, then use this code:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nprint(norm.cdf(x, mean, std))\n```\n\nThe area under a curve `y = f(x)` from `x = a` to `x = b` is the same as the integral of `f(x)dx` from `x = a` to `x = b`. [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html) has a quick easy way to do integrals. And the probability of finding a single point in that area cannot be one because the idea is that the total area under the curve is one (unless MAYBE it's a delta function). So you should get `0 ≤ probability of value < 1` for any particular value of interest. There may be different ways of doing it, but a conventional way is to assign confidence intervals along the x-axis, like this\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nZGpKyO.jpg).\n\n---\n\n## Univariate Analysis:(Histogram, PDF, CDF)\n\n### Histogram\nA histogram consists of adjacent rectangles erected on the x axis, split into discrete intervals called bins, and with an area proportional to the frequency of the occurrences for that bin. It counts the data points in each bin, and shows the bins on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. In our case, the bins will be the three features, 'age', 'nodes', 'year'\n\nA [density plot](http://serialmentor.com/dataviz/histograms-density-plots.html) is a smoothed, continuous version of a histogram estimated from the data. The most common form of estimation is known as Kernel Density Estimate. It is used for visualizing the Probability Density of a continuous variable.\n\n**[Kernel density estimation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/distributions.html#tutorial-kde)** -> KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions. A histogram aims to approximate the underlying probability density function that generated the data by binning and counting observations. Kernel density estimation (KDE) presents a different solution to the same problem. Rather than using discrete bins, a KDE plot smooths the observations with a Gaussian kernel, producing a continuous density estimate:\n\nTo make density plots in seaborn, we can use `histplot` function because it lets us make multiple distributions with one function call. For example, we can make a density plot showing showing the count of the three features variables, on top of the corresponding histogram.\n\nIn below with (kde=True) adding a kernel density estimate to smooth the histogram, providing complementary information about the shape of the distribution\n\nThe curve shows the density plot, on top of the histogram, and the density plot is essentially a smoothed version of the histogram. The y-axis represents the density, and the histogram is normalized by default so that it has the same y-scale as the density plot.\n\nFirst I will do simple Histogram between 'status' and 'age'","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.FacetGrid(original_df, hue='status', height=6) \\\n    .map(sns.histplot, 'year', kde=True) \\\n    .add_legend()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.FacetGrid(original_df, hue='status', height=6) \\\n    .map(sns.histplot, 'age', kde=True) \\\n    .add_legend()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.FacetGrid(original_df, hue='status', height=6) \\\n    .map(sns.histplot, 'nodes', kde=True) \\\n    .add_legend()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# And below I am doing for all the three variables\n# Keeping them commented out for now\n# for df in [survival_status_yes]:\n#     for column in original_df.columns[:-1]:\n#         sns.FacetGrid(df, hue='status', height=6).map(sns.histplot, column, kde=True).add_legend()\n#         plt.show()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### Observation looking at the Histogram and PDF above\n\n- From the above there figures, the PDF of survival status based on age is highly overlapping.

So, using this datapoint we cannot predict anything\n\n- 'axillary nodes' is the most clearly discernible. Generally we can say, that people survive long if they have less axillary nodes detected and vice versa but still this datapoint as well not hugely beneficial to classify.\n\n---\n\n## CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) along with PDF\n\nCDF will give us the cumulative plot of PDF so that you can calculate the exact percentage of patient survival status.\n\n(Note, earlier I plotted and calculated the PDF's with seaborn, now I will be using numpy's `histogram` function )\n\n### A note on `numpy.histogram()` function\n\nThe function returns two values `hist` which gives the array of values of the histogram, and `edge_bin` which is an array of float datatype containing the bin edges having length one more than the hist.\n\nA bin is range that represents the width of a single bar of the histogram along the X-axis. You could also call this the interval. (Wikipedia defines them more formally as \"disjoint categories\".)\n\nThe Numpy `histogram` function doesn't draw the histogram, but it computes the occurrences of input data that fall within each bin, which in turns determines the area (not necessarily the height if the bins aren't of equal width) of each bar.\n\nIn this example:\n\n     np.histogram([1, 2, 1], bins=[0, 1, 2, 3])\n\nThere are 3 bins, for values ranging from 0 to 1 (excl 1.), 1 to 2 (excl. 2) and 2 to 3 (incl. 3), respectively. The way Numpy defines these bins if by giving a list of delimiters (`[0, 1, 2, 3]`) in this example, although it also returns the bins in the results, since it can choose them automatically from the input, if none are specified. If `bins=5`, for example, it will use 5 bins of equal width spread between the minimum input value and the maximum input value.\n\nThe input values are 1, 2 and 1. Therefore, bin \"1 to 2\" contains two occurrences (the two `1` values), and bin \"2 to 3\" contains one occurrence (the `2`). These results are in the first item in the returned tuple: `array([0, 2, 1])`.\n\nSince the bins here are of equal width, you can use the number of occurrences for the height of each bar. When drawn, you would have:\n\n  * a bar of height 0 for range/bin [0,1] on the X-axis,\n  * a bar of height 2 for range/bin [1,2],\n  * a bar of height 1 for range/bin [2,3].\n\nImplementing numpy.histogram while reading an image\n\n`histogram, bin_edges = np.histogram(image, bins=256, range=(0, 1))`\n\nAs stated above, the parameter bins determines the histogram size, or the number of “bins” to use for the histogram.

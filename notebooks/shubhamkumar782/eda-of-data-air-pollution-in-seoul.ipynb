Seoul Metropolitan Government provides many public data, including air pollution information, through the 'Open Data Plaza' I made a structured dataset by collecting and adjusting various air pollution related datasets provided by the Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\nContent\n\nThis data provides average values for six pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10, PM2.5). - Data were measured every hour between 2017 and 2019. - Data were measured for 25 districts in Seoul.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Descripion of factors avialable in Data\n\n\nSO2 - Sulfur dioxide is a gas. It is invisible and has a nasty, sharp smell. It reacts easily with other substances to form harmful compounds, such as sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid and sulfate particles.\n\nAbout 99% of the sulfur dioxide in air comes from human sources. The main source of sulfur dioxide in the air is industrial activity that processes materials that contain sulfur, eg the generation of electricity from coal, oil or gas that contains sulfur. Some mineral ores also contain sulfur, and sulfur dioxide is released when they are processed. In addition, industrial activities that burn fossil fuels containing sulfur can be important sources of sulfur dioxide.\n\nSulfur dioxide is also present in motor vehicle emissions, as the result of fuel combustion. In the past, motor vehicle exhaust was an important, but not the main, source of sulfur dioxide in air. However, this is no longer the case.\n\nNO2 - Nitrogen dioxide is part of a group of gaseous air pollutants produced as a result of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion processes. Its presence in air contributes to the formation and modification of other air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, and to acid rain.\n\nCO - CO is a colorless, odorless gas that can be harmful when inhaled in large amounts. CO is released when something is burned. The greatest sources of CO to outdoor air are cars, trucks and other vehicles or machinery that burn fossil fuels. A variety of items in your home such as unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, leaking chimneys and furnaces, and gas stoves also release CO and can affect air quality indoors.\n\nO3 - Ozone (O3) is a gas that can form and react under the action of light and that is present in two layers of the atmosphere. High up in the atmosphere, ozone forms a layer that shields the Earth from ultraviolet rays. However, at ground level, ozone is considered a major air pollutant.\n\nPM10 & PM2.5 - PM stands for Particulate Matter. PM2.5 and PM10 are minute particles present in the air and exposure to it is very harmful for health. When the level of these particles increases and penetrate deeply in to the lungs, you can experience number of health impacts like breathing problem, burning or sensation in the eyes etc.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndata_air=

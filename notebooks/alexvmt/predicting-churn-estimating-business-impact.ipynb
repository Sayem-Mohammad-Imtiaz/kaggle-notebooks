In the case of the telecommunication industry, a customer who churns is a customer who cancels or doesn't extend the existing contract with the telco company. The key assumption here is that acquiring a new customer is more expensive than retaining an existing one. Therefore, it might be a good idea to build a model that uses existing data to identify customers who are likely to churn. Once identified, those customers can be targeted with special offers, for instance, to increase the chances of them staying with their current telco provider. Retaining customer who would churn otherwise saves the cost of acquiring new customers."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e038fff98944598470f63aaff1fc712feb2557d8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **<a id='2'>2.

First, for each numeric feature we have, 'MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges', and 'tenure', we create a function that maps the values of each numeric variable to a specific group (low, lower medium, upper medium or high) based on the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of each numeric variable, respectively. We then, in turn, apply this function to each numeric variable to create a new column for each numeric variable in our data frame that represents to which group each instance in our data belongs, respectively. Finally, we create a countplot of the groups for each numeric variable and the amount of customers who did and who didn't churn.\n\n\n*Note: The groups in the following plots are based on quartiles. If one were to create different groups, based on different quantiles for instance, the plots could look considerably different.*\n\n\nFirst, let's consider 'MonthlyCharges'. We observe that most customers fall into the low group, followed by the lower medium group. The upper medium group contains less customers than the high group and both contain less customers than the low and the lower medium group. Interestingly, the amount of customers who churned appears to increase with monthly charges group and slightly falls off again when the high group is reached. This implies that the higher a customer's monthly charge, the less likely he is to churn. This fits to the observation we made before: the more engaged a customer, i.e. the more services are included in the contract, the less likely he is to churn.

The confusion matrix below shows how many predictions were correct and how many were incorrect.\n\n- **True negatives**: In the upper left are the 'true negatives', i.e. the model predicted 'no churn' and the customer actually didn't churn.

In other words, the Logistic Regression model calculates for each observation the probability of belonging to one or the other class, e.g. 0.73 'churn' and 0.27 'not churn'. Using a threshold of 0.5, the Logistic Regression model then assigns an observation to the 'churn' class if the probability of belonging to this class is greater than 0.5 for this observation. The default threshold for our Logistic Regression model is 0.5 and next we will vary this threshold to see how the predictions change."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e36e0ed936273d1f01cfb9aba4ff52c8681c465b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# set up list with different model thresholds and an empty cost variable\n\nthresh = np.arange(0.1,1.1,0.1).tolist()\ncost = [0] * 10","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d36f6331f6fab89dba24c9213cb66694baf63530"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# get probabilities of belonging to the 'churn' class\n\nprobs = LR_grid.predict_proba(X_test_scaled)[:,0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"018af31f7f9b6b86adcc7d141467fdccd43064d4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# set up objects to store predictions for different thresholds\n\nthresh_1 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_2 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_3 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_4 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_5 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_6 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_7 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_8 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_9 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]\nthresh_10 = [0] * y_test.shape[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"_uuid":"d304a94df51b3419fe7a1faebf722fb7b4051aa8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# convert probabilities to binary predictions for different thresholds and store them in the respective lists\n\nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.1:\n        thresh_1[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_1[i] = 0\n\nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.2:\n        thresh_2[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_2[i] = 0\n\nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.3:\n        thresh_3[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_3[i] = 0\n\nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.4:\n        thresh_4[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_4[i] = 0\n\nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.5:\n        thresh_5[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_5[i] = 0\n        \nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.6:\n        thresh_6[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_6[i] = 0\n        \nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.7:\n        thresh_7[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_7[i] = 0\n        \nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.8:\n        thresh_8[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_8[i] = 0\n        \nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 0.9:\n        thresh_9[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_9[i] = 0\n        \nfor i in range(0,y_test.shape[0]):\n    if probs[i] > 1.0:\n        thresh_10[i] = 1\n    else:\n        thresh_10[i] = 0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4dab9051e69ff4f985182dd9da39dc932bfa8b4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have now predictions for 10 different thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 1.\n\n\nNext we calculate the hypothetical cost that we could save using our model for each of our 10 different thresholds. \n\n\nBut first, we need some more assumptions.

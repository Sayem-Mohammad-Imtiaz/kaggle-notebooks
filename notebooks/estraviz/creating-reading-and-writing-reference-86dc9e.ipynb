But, most of the time, we won't actually be creating our own data by hand, we'll be working with data that already exists.\n\nData can be stored in any of a number of different forms and formats. By far the most basic of these is the humble CSV file. When you open a CSV file you get something that looks like this:\n\n```csv\nProduct A,Product B,Product C,\n30,21,9,\n35,34,1,\n41,11,11\n```\n\nSo a CSV file is a table of values separated by commas. Hence the name: \"comma-seperated values\", or CSV.\n\nLet's now set aside our toy datasets and see what a real dataset looks like when we read it into a `DataFrame`.

We will see how to do so in the next section.\n\nFor now, let's move on to another common data format: SQL files.\n\nSQL databases are where most of the data on the web ultimately gets stored. They can be used to store data on things as simple as recipes to things as complicated as \"almost everything on the Kaggle website\".\n\nConnecting to a SQL database requires a lot more thought than reading from an Excel file. For one, you need to create a **connector**, something that will handle siphoning data from the database.\n\n`pandas` won't do this for you automatically because there are many, many different types of SQL databases out there, each with its own connector.

For this reason, recall was chosen as the performance metric rather than accuracy. That is, performance should be weighted towards identifying heavy drinkers even if it means incorrectly classifying some normal drinkers as heavy drinkers.\n\nThe most effective model proved to be a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) followed by logistic regression. The PCA reduced the 50 feature space to three features and achieved the most impressive recall in finding the heavy drinkers but also incorrectly classifying many non-drinkers as heavy drinkers.\n\nIn an attempt to detect any subtle signals, both the maths and Portugese classes were combined in the same analysis. If more data could be obtained, these should be considered separately. The shape of the learning curves on both simple and complex models suggest that more data would help amplify the subtle signals and perhaps smoothen out the noise found in this analysis.\n\n\n#

However, the analysis approach was applied consistently between the two classes.\n* Even considered with both classes combined, the dataset may be too small (1044 instances x 34 features) unless the predictive power of the features is very large.\n* Catgorical variables and binary variables were converted to numeric to be used with scikit-learn in later modelling.\n* Three features were engineered\n    * overall_grade - a combined measure of all the assessment periods with the final grade (G3) weighted heaviest (numeric: 0 - 20)\n    * binge_drinker - student drinks excessively on weekends but only lightly during the week (binary: 0 (no) or 1 (yes))\n    * heavy_drinker - student drinks excessively on weekends and weekdays (binary: 0 (no) or 1 (yes))\n* Correlation analysis using Pearson and Spearman techniques were carried out\n    * initially, on all of the non-dummy variables.\n    * then on a subset of variables to focus in on the relationships with the highest correlations coefficients.\n    * the absolute coefficient sizes for both methods were\n        * fairly small (0.1 - 0.3) with a few exceptions. \n        * the coefficients between Spearman and Pearson were very similar.\n        * This suggests the relationships are quite noisey and not strongly tending towards linear or non-linear shapes.\n* the transformed dataset was output to be used in predictive modelling (to be linked here once completed)\n        \n# Table of Contents\n* [Data Preparation](#data_preparation)\n* [Data Understanding](#data_understanding)\n* [Correlation Analysis](#correlation_analysis)"},{"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"trusted":false,"_uuid":"9c1db85b0b4ad10d27548adf7c8088b4e853acbb"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.ticker as ticker\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"c5b0abab9ea1d0f9e990c616bc2d16876b0f8efa"},"cell_type":"code","source":"maths = pd.read_csv(\"../input/student-mat.csv\")\nportugese = pd.read_csv(\"../input/student-por.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fccf5f5e74f56ab30665de5208c9fccc9407541f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"data_preparation\"></a>\n# Data Preparation\n\nWhile the uploader of these datasets included instructions on how to merge the data, the absence of unique identifiers opens up the risk of incorrectly merging records from two different students as one.\n\nIn addition, from the symmetric difference statement below, the two datasets have identical columns."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"8af95ec2cf0bae98cfe9c5b59d95d8587698ca08"},"cell_type":"code","source":"set(maths.columns).symmetric_difference(portugese.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4b6fe073b96a3dfdf7bd19b3f6b27f533997626"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a result, the two dataframes will not be merged but labelled with their corresponding subject and concatenated.

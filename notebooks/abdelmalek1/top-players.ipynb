For the same reason, top scorers mean more goals, and more goals mean more chances and attempts on goals so they going to miss more attempts so that they dropped the table   \nAnd now the question that needs more investigation are those players outliers!? Should they score more than that to judge them !?   \nIt's logical that not all the players play an equal amount of matches and participate in match equal amount of minutes, but does that the case in every league !? and if that not the best way to identify the real striker, what would be the best metrics? More Analysis is needed.  \nI will continue working on this kernel to find it and if anyone has an opinion to help, it will be appreciated   "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d5b46debddcb657f6880bf6e364d8cc5f7a195eb"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Refrences \n1. https://statsbomb.com/2015/11/flavio/\n2. https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-method-to-predict-player-performance-using-fantasy-football-data-8b2d3adb3a1a\n3. https://talksport.com/football/234007/who-won-what-around-europe-201617-season-league-champions-and-cup-winners-revealed/\n4. https://statsbomb.com/2014/01/you-might-think-messi-is-the-best-goalscorer-in-each-of-the-past-4-seasons-you-would-be-wrong/\n5. http://11tegen11.net/2014/01/15/how-to-scout-goal-scoring-talent/"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"44dd6887483419f9de902f01371a390fd9de957f"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

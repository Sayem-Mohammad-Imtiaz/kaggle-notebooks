We used pandas to create dataframes and sift through our data, reorganizing, extracting, and graphing important data categories that we want to visualize. For the dataset, we found the EMS-related calls represented the most 911 calls, followed by traffic and then fire. We found 2 outliers that occured on March 2nd, 2018 and November 15th, 2018, both likely due to sever weather conditions, and mentioned how, with more research, you could draw insights from the investigation of these two dates and the data behind it.

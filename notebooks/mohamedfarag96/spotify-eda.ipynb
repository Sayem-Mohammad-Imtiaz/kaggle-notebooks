Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n\n3. *Energy*: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.\n\n4. *Tempo*: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n5. *Loudness*: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.\n\n6. *Speechiness*: This detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n\n7. *Liveness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n\netc.....\n\nCheck that link: https://towardsdatascience.com/what-makes-a-song-likeable-dbfdb7abe404#:~:text=Valence%3A%20Describes%20the%20musical%20positiveness,measure%20of%20intensity%20and%20activity."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2 -Information about data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***We can see clearly no missing data in our dataframe***"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3- Sanity Check"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.1- Check for duplicates"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sum(df.duplicated())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.2- Check for missing data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().any().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.3- Columns data-type"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***We can see clearly all columns in the data frame are stored using the correct data-type***"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4- Data Analysis\n\n1.

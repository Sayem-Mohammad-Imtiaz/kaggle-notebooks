One of the follow up exercises I had suggested was trying to add in more features to improve the models not only through tuning algorithms, but through the use of better data.\n\nOn my spare time I started sniffing around and found two datasets that make a good starting point for trying to add to the original features and build better predictive models. And since I was now doing this outside of the confines of the R users group, I have switched over to python for the selfish reason of wanting to keep my python data visualization skills sharp.\n\nThe new data I used:\n\nA list of the latitude and longitude of cities in California: \nhttp://52.26.186.219/internships/useit/content/cities-california-latitude-and-longitude\n\nHistorical population data for cities in California (including the year 1990, which is the year the original housing price data was collected :\nhttp://www.dof.ca.gov/Reports/Demographic_Reports/documents/2010-1850_STCO_IncCities-FINAL.xls\n\nI have cleaned the originals (a.k.a. de-excel'd) and put them on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-feature-engineering\n\nThere is the potential to add a lot of different features based on these dataframes, but my goal was to focus on engineering the following (predominantly geospatial) features for each data point:\n1. The name of the nearest city.\n2. The distance from the district's coordinates to the nearest city.\n3. The population of the nearest city.\n4. The nearest 'big city' (a big city is categorized as >500,000 residents in the given year, 1990).\n5. The distance to the nearest 'big city'.\n\nBelow I walk through the code I used to add these 5 bits of information to each housing district's list of predictors. I then develop some maps/plots to help visualize the new features and see what information was added, and finally I train an xgboost model on the expanded feature set and assess its performance relative to the previous models I had built using the original data only.\n\nBefore we start a few limitations to note on the data we are adding -  I am not sure if these are comprehensive lists of the cities in California. In fact there is imperfect overlap between the coordinates and population data (so some of the smaller towns are not prefectly represented in the added features), so the data aren't perfect but do a fair job of representing the large/medium cities and towns in California\n\nIf there are more good features you can think of engineering I encourage you to give the notebook a fork and try them out!\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"08db496d51d8d2656622429747657a113086a0c1","_cell_guid":"57110c79-7999-459c-94ff-f238c8120d46","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\nfrom pandas.tools.plotting import scatter_matrix\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom geopy.distance import vincenty\n\nimport gc","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"204810a4cc875d011bb43ca81beb36baae6fb5d6","_cell_guid":"d6dbf8e9-e41c-4ea5-9738-583a2eff9002","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#######\n# read in the data\n######\nhousing = pd.read_csv('../input/california-housing-prices/housing.csv')\nhousing.head()\n\n\ncity_lat_long = pd.read_csv('../input/california-housing-feature-engineering/cal_cities_lat_long.csv')\ncity_pop_data = pd.read_csv('../input/california-housing-feature-engineering/cal_populations_city.csv')\ncounty_pop_data = pd.read_csv('../input/california-housing-feature-engineering/cal_populations_county.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8818df29320eaa19466c6bfd85d5ab8cecc167fe","_cell_guid":"eadc1ce0-238d-481a-b5e2-da14153b3909"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code below iterates through the coordinates dataframe and builds a dictonary with the city names as the keys and a tuple of the corresponding (latitude, longitude) as the values.

They can also aid the model by providing a rough representation of more abstract aspects associated with position in town, such as the commute time for people working in city centers.

Other Engineered Features - Distance to the big city\n\nThis set of features shows which big city (San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego or Los Angeles... those are all really religious spanish names!) a given district is closest to. The cutoff for 'big city' was 500,000 people (this is 1990 data remember). The black lines here represent the same information as the previous plot, and each district was given a value for the distance to the nearest big city (Vincenty) and a categorical for the name of the nearest big city.  I decided to add these features in because the proximity to a large city is somthing I intuitively thought would impact a house price. Access to things like major aiports and major entertainment events/venues could all have a small but important effect of the price of a home.\n\nLooking at the map below, we can see that this clustering also has an interesting side effect of effectively splitting California into quarters. So having the categorical San Francisco as the closest big city is roughly equivalent to being from the northern 1/4 of the state, while the San Diego category is roughly equivalent to the bottom 1/4 of California (I said roughy... don't get out the rulers!). So this feature may be adding some extra structure to the data in ways I had not initially intended."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fe37c6cf8ef6a9cd2b03c5c0f7f5936227a4f6d0","_cell_guid":"00910f15-5f1e-47d2-bddf-384e8452e807","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"####\n# graph of the

Through the simple addition of some population and geospatial data we have reduced the error. The original dataset did contain latitude and longitude data, but we have greatly enhanced these data by giving the models information on the size of the nearest town, the distance to the nearest town, and as well as data on the distance to the nearest big city.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Then I found Plotly, and it made my life easier.\n\nThis tutorial will introduce some basic methods to visualizing data using 'Plotly Express', a great library that provides interactive, responsive and  easily readable plots. There are many great visualizing libraries that currently exist and have a lot of great capabilities, but none has the interactive capabilities that Plotly Express offers to its users.\n\nAny figure created in a single function call with Plotly Express could be created using graph objects alone, but with between 5 and 100 times more lines of code. Visualizing data is great, but being able to interact and apply edits and filters instantly to any chart, increases the value we can get from every line of code! It allows us to further analyse every aspect in a chart or a plot and explore new theories."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Tutorial Content\n\nIn this tutorial, we will show how to create simple yet powerful interactive visualizations in Python, specifically using [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/).\n\nWe will be using data collected from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/), the most popular movies website. IMDb stores information related to more than 6 million titles (of which almost 500,000 are featured films). The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset. The data was scraped from the website on 1/1/2020.\n \n\nWe will cover the following topics in this tutorial:\n1.

This parameter helps us create subplots based on our 10 years grouping.\n\nAnother new parameter - But is explicitly for box plots - is the 'points' parameter. The parameter offers a lot of options to make adjustments to how a box-and-whisker diagram looks like. \n\nSome of the useful arguments that you can use for it is \n\n'all': which shows all points also on the plot\n\nFalse: Which hides the points from the plot\n\nFor this example we will set points to be False just because there are many points and depending on your computer it might crash it, but feel free to change it and see how it looks."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.box(movies_duration_df, \n             y=\"duration\", \n             title= 'Duration of movies change by year',\n             facet_col = 'year', \n             points = False,\n             color = 'year')\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So in just 2-3 lines in Plotly express, we created a lot of great simple plots that hold a lot of value."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"10\"></a> <br>\n\n# 10.

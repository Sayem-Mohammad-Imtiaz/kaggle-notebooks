we manually encoded the categorical features, it becomes easier to understand what’s been represented in each category. For instance, the feature ‘contract’ has 3 categories. ‘Month-to-month’ was encoded with the lowest value and it’s represented by the blue color. ‘One year’ is the mid value and it’s represented in purple. ‘Two years’ is the highest value and is represented in red. We can clearly see that the ‘month-to-month’ category impacts the prediction towards the positive value (churn), while the other types of contracts push the prediction into the opposite direction (no churn).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"5\">References</a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/06/auc-roc-curve-machine-learning/\n- https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/tree_based_models/Catboost%20tutorial.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <center> If you find this notebook useful, support with an upvote! <center>","metadata":{}}]}

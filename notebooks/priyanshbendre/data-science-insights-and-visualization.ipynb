This is a surprised finding, because overall, theft is the most prevalent crime with 22%, while narcotics is the 4th one with only 9%. At first, we had expected that the highest crime rate regions (locations with distance less than 3km) would have had higher rate of theft. However, it turns out that in these regions, crimes related to narcotics are even more frequent.\n\nHence, our suggestion is that for these unsafe regions, the police better watch out for narcotics crimes to prevent all actions and consequences related to narcotics. And police also better watch out for drug users in these regions becasue drug users are supposed to be more likely than nonusers to commit crimes. Handling these crimes may make these regions safer in the future, and overall not getting the bad reputation as being an unsafe region.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

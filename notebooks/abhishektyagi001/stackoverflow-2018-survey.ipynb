This year marks the eighth year that Stack Overflow published the Annual Developer Survey resultsâ€”with the largest number of respondents yet. Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey in January 2018.\n\nThis year, they covered a few new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to ethics in coding. They also found that underrepresented groups in tech responded to our survey at even lower rates than we would expect from their participation in the workforce. \n\nThere are **98,855** responses in this public data release. These responses are what Stack Overflow considered *qualified* for analytical purposes based on completion and time spent on the survey and included at least one non-PII question. Of the qualified responses, **67,441** completed the entire survey.\n\n<a href=\"#0\"><font size=\"1\">Go to top</font></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d5c67a45ff7927350c847c4b49b231e6cf5f86c7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"2\">Load packages</a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"383770d81eea75c4d71d3978497c4edd618afc2e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom math import pi\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline \n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n# Print all rows and columns\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\nIS_LOCAL = True\n\nimport os\n\nif(IS_LOCAL):\n    PATH=\"../input/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey\"\nelse:\n    PATH=\"../input\"\nprint(os.listdir(PATH))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1fe4c4e8b3c2f488f24ef89f06a396149cf6641f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"3\">Read the data</a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"86b330255ac7a7aec64df554035872be63ce6a94","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_df = pd.read_csv(PATH+\"/survey_results_public.csv\")\nschema_df = pd.read_csv(PATH+\"/survey_results_schema.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8423d18690442a3340af903d304e49f078eb62da"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href=\"#0\"><font size=\"1\">Go to top</font></a>\n\n# <a id=\"4\">Check the data</a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"74c1551e512810f2116b1f7e9bb5196e5dee3a3c","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey data -  rows:\",data_df.shape[0],\" columns:\", data_df.shape[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"49c33c56ee1e87627a8d8393f6dbfa7ca919b72a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are **98,885** data rows and **129** columns."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d733d05eaeb18f6e394afc4da2d94529dbd98cfd","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey schema -  rows:\",schema_df.shape[0],\" columns:\", schema_df.shape[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7bac18eb540e6189110a07350571d590dc5a8a5a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The schema dataset contains **129** rows - each row will explain one column from the main dataset. \n\n\n<a href=\"#0\"><font size=\"1\">Go to top</font></a>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e24517b12a692ece5990e1154debece0c8031b00"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id=\"41\">Glimpse the data</a>\n\nWe start by looking to the data features (first 5 rows)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"864dbba32dd49c86ad16a00e2b9f68e407b60f93","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f7bd779e257b612bc92f186bfea6c94f68dd091e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id=\"42\">Check missing data</a>  \n\nLet's check if there is any missing data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"68f4c93ae22e0e56d37bd6f3f3b8bfc728947aa4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"total = data_df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending = False)\npercent = (data_df.isnull().sum()/data_df.isnull().count()*100).sort_values(ascending = False)\ntmp = pd.concat([total, percent], axis=1, keys=['Total', 'Percent'])\n\ndef plot_missing_data(start, end, text):\n    tmp1 = tmp[start:end]\n    plt.figure(figsize = (16,4))\n    plt.title('Missing data - percents of missing data (part %s)' % text)\n    s = sns.barplot(x=tmp1.index,y=tmp1['Percent'])\n    s.set_xticklabels(s.get_xticklabels(),rotation=90)\n    plt.show()    \n    \n\nplot_missing_data(1,65,\"I\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"487354b09349b9ce04226b74d75e5e99e54fb29e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_missing_data(66,129,\"II\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b20a80386913d5bf030293ac6b1209139b9b81a3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Most of the respondents answered to questions: **DevType**, **YearsCoding**, **FormalEducation**, **Student**, **Employment** and **Country**.

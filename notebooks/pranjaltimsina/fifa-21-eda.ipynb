Oblak clearly won the fight. Jan is a bit slower, but on all other fronts, he is clearly better.\n<a id=\"section-seven\"></a>\n# 7. The End?\n\nPeople can take different approaches to a dataset; what I've presented above is the dataset through my eyes. Of course, this notebook hasn't done justice to the 106 columns of this dataset, but that does not mean anything useful was not discovered - ~some~ most of what I've presented was rather obvious, but I think it is beautiful when data backs our intuition. Here is the summary of our findings.\n\n1. The negative skewness of the physical attributes can be attributed to the older players. Perhaps, excluding players over 35 years of age will result in the distributions being closer to the normal distribution.\n2. The weight of players tends to be 75 kgs and their height tend to be 180cms.\n3. Players with 5 start skill moves are very rare.\n4. Brazillians are the most skilled. When it comes to players with 4 star skill moves, Spain comes second, but it's sad that they are no where around the top 10 when considering 5 star skill moves alone.\n5. Juventus loves hoarding players with 5 star skill moves.\n6. Lille, Chelsea and Manchester City love to loan out their players. \n7. Dribbling, passing, and shooting seem to have mid to high positive correlation (dribbling and passing have the highest correlation with 0.834).\n8. The correlation between a player's physic and defending (0.55) was not as high as I expected it to be.\n9. We can see a some correlation between pace, shooting and dribbling, too.\n10. Goalkeepers tend to be older than outfield players.\n11. Oblak is a really good goalkeeper.\n\nI hope these new found insights will help you while playing FIFA 21 Career mode.\n\nAlso, thank you for taking time to go through my work.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

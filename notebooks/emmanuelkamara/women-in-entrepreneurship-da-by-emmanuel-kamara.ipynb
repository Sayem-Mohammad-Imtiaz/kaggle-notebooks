{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By Emmanuel Kamara. \nEntrepreneurship plays a major role in the develoment of every nation. In this notebook, I will use a dataset to examine the entrepreneurship index, women labor force perticipation, inflation rate, and women entrepreneurship index in both developing and developed nations in the world. The goal of this project is to provide a compelling reason why entrepreneurship should be encouraged especially in developing nations.

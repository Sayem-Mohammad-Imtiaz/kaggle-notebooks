With increased age, it can be hypothesized that the probability of heart attack will increase.\n\n* sex: This is provided as binary feature with '0' & '1' values. However, it is not clear which of the two feature is male or female. Based on [medical observations](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/throughout-life-heart-attacks-are-twice-as-common-in-men-than-women), we can make an educated guess of which of the binary feature is what. However, if the dataset is not randomly sampled or the has been conditioned for sex, it may not work.\n\n* cp: Chest pain type. Chest pain can happen due to multiple reasons, including those [not related to cardiac issues](https://www.healthline.com/health/chest-pain#TOC_TITLE_HDR_1). This feature classifies the chest pain into those related or not related to heart issues.\n\n* trtbs: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg). High blood pressure has been positively correlated to [increased probability of heart attack](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/health-threats-from-high-blood-pressure/how-high-blood-pressure-can-lead-to-a-heart-attack).\n\n* chol: cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor. This dataset doesn't specify the kind of cholestrol. There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \"bad\" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"good\" cholesterol. [High value of LDL build-up of plaque inside the blood vessels, which might lead to heart attack.](https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cholesterol-levels/) Conversely, HDL helps get rid of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. We may hypothesize that the reposted cholestrol is LDL, and heart rate should increase with chol levels.\n\n* fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false). [Higher blood sugar might lead to increased risk of heart attacks](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/news/20160108/high-blood-sugar-may-increase-heart-attack-complications-study)\n\n* rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results. It has 3 values, 0 being normal, 1 having [ST-T wave abnormality](http://hqmeded-ecg.blogspot.com/2019/02/st-depression-and-t-wave-inversion-in.html)Right ventricular hypertrophy as the cause of the ST depression and T-wave inversion, and 2 showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria. Right ventricle hypertropy(abnormal enlargement of cardiac muscle surrounding the right ventricle) [usually occurs due to chronic lung disease or structural defects in heart.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ventricular_hypertrophy). It can be beneign or can lead of heart complications. Left ventricle hypertropy(abnormal enlargement of cardiac muscle surrounding the left ventricle) happens as [results of other heart problems](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-valve-problems-and-disease/heart-valve-problems-and-causes/what-is-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-lvh) can lead to heart failure.\n\n* thalach : maximum heart rate achieved. The maximum heart rate for a healthy person can be estimated using [simple formula](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/heartrate.htm). It can be used to undestand whether the person is doing good in terms of aerobic health, which is supposed to be related to heart health.\n\n* exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no). The chest pain during exercise can be read in line with cp(Chest pain type).

Even though we were suspecting that '1' respresents female, when looked through the age, it says otherwise. Males are more at risk of heart-attack and earlier than females. So, '1' seem to be males. The data might be sampled to increase the cases of high risk cases deliberatley.\n2. Comparing cases when conditioned for cholesterol and when conditioned for age, the chest pain shows inverse relation for asymtomatic pain case. The case of asymtomatic pain predicting high risk of heart attck is higher for higher age group. An asymptomatic pain even with low cholesterol can be fatal.\n3. The cholesteral distribution has a higher range sex code 0.\n\n\nI will add further relations between features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Correlation plot between continious features","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))\nsns.heatmap(df[['age', 'trtbps', 'chol', 'thalachh', 'oldpeak']].corr());","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The correation(positive or negative), means that there is a linear directional relationship between two features, the direction specified by the sign of the correlation and strength of the correlation specified by the value.\n\n**We observe**:\n\n* There is a slight negative correlation between the 'maximum heart-rate achived' and 'age'.\n* There is a slight negative correlation between the 'maximum heart-rate achived' and 'oldpeak'.\n\nHowever, there is no high correlation pair, and we can just ignore the correlation for now.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 7.

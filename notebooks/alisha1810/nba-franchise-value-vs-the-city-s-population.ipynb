If this team were \"on sale\" would you buy? *\n\nEvery basketball team has its franchise value. But this value does not reflect the team's performance. On contrary, the worst in terms of performance teams (like LA Lakers, NY Knicks) have the highest franchise value (as of 2017). The most paid players do not necessary play for the highest valued teams. \nTo measure a player’s impact, different sport analysts invented their own measurement, like Real Plus-Minus, PIayer Impact Estimate (PIE) and so on.\nThe idea od this notebook to explore  the relationship between metrics as  the team's franchise value, social media activity of MVPs and the team's performance. \n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cd3d25dd-7b26-4027-99f0-1b1a57871b4b","_uuid":"d2e772d31b3e5e2590ffe0fcd4bff03b5066eaf1","_execution_state":"idle","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\ncolor = sns.color_palette()\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\ndisplay(HTML(\"<style>.container { width:100% !important; }</style>\"))\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a6df8b756cd09d751218978f97fdf42c88c97e65"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at fan's attendence statistics of each team.

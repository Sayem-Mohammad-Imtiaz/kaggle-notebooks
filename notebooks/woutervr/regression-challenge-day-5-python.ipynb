(Already, can you believe it?) In the last four days, we've:\n\n* [Day 1: Learned about different types of regression (Poisson, linear and logistic) and when to use them](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/regression-challenge-day-1)\n* [Day 2: Learned how to fit & evaluate a model with diagnostic plots](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/regression-challenge-day-2)\n* [Day 3: Learned how to read and understand models](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/regression-challenge-day-3)\n* [Day 4: Learned how to fit & interpret a multiple regression model](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/regression-challenge-day-4)\n\nYesterday we learned about multiple regression, when we use multiple inputs to predict an output. Multiple regression is very powerful, but it also creates a new problem. So far we've just been picking input variables we think are interesting by hand. But what if you have three or four hundred input variables and no way of knowing ahead of time which ones are going to be important/interesting? Today we're going to learn one technique for **automatically selecting which input variables to use.** Picking which input variables to use in a model is called \"feature selection\". \n\nOne way to do this is by just fitting a regular GLM regression model and then picking the predictors that have a very big effect on our training data. There are, unfortunately, two big problems with this.\n\n**Over-fitting:** This is when your model is so powerful it's picking up on random patterns in your training data that aren't actually helpful. When you then use that model to try to make predictions on a new dataset you're going to get poor results. In general, the more complex your model is and the more input variables you use the more likely you are to over-fit. In the case of feature selection, overfitting means that you're likely to accidentally select variables that aren't actually important.\n\n**Multicollinearity:** When two or more of your input variables are very strongly related to each other (for example someone's age and the number of birthdays they've had), even if they would actually be very informative for your model they may not show up as important when you look at your GLM model. In particular, the standard error will be much bigger for variables that are highly related to each other. The big impact on feature selection is that this means that you're likely to throw out those variables, even if they are actually very important and interesting!\n\nFortunately for us, we can tackle both of these problems in one fell swoop by using Elastic Net to select our variables. Elastic Net is a regularization technique for regression, which means it helps us avoid over-fitting by making sure that none of coefficients end up being ridiculously large. At the same time, if a variable isn't important Elastic Net will remove it from the regression model by setting its co-efficient to exactly 0. The really nice thing about Elastic Net is that it's particularly good at dealing with multicollinearity; it won't drop groups of correlated variables if the group as a whole is helpful. (If you're curious about the math under the hood, you can check out [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x/abstract).)\n\nToday, we're going to learn how to use Elastic Net to help us select which variables to use for multiple regression.

This is another technique to help avoid over-fitting. The general idea is that you take your full dataset and train a model on just part it. Then you take a slightly different subset of your data and then train another model on that data. In this case, we're going to take ten different subsamples, train a model on each subsample and then average those models together to get our final model.

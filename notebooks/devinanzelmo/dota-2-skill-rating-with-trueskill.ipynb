A 100k sample of the provided 900k matches is used to demonstrate the calculation of player skill\n\nThe default values for the trueskill python library are used. For those interested it is probably a good idea to change these values. The python library is available at https://github.com/sublee/trueskill, and a different R implementation is available for R on CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trueskill/index.html I have not tested to see whether this is included in the r docker Kaggle uses. The python implementation is available already.\n\nHere is microsofts description of TrueSkill https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/ note that it is mentioned in this resource that for the 4v4 team case 46 matches are required to get a good skill estimate. In the 900k sample I requirement is not often met, and the actual requirement is higher because Dota is 5v5\n\nFor a great introduction to TrueSkill and skill rating read this blog post by Kaggle developer Jeff Moser http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6fc46fbd-d62d-6fcd-41bf-16130055b6b3"},"source":"**Note** \n\nThis is different then the code I used on my local system to compute ratings.

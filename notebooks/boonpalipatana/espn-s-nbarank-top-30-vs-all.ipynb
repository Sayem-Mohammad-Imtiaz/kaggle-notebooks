The gray line marks the \"Line of Neutrality,\" where a player along that line essentially allows exactly the proportion of field goals as they make. Players above the line let in a higher proportion of field goals on defense than they make on offense, implying that they may be a liability, and players below the line make a higher proportion of field goals on offense than they let in on defense, which is obviously desirable. The further a player is from the Line of Neutrality, the larger the scale of their good/bad-ness. Plotly plots have the nice feature that you can isolate each subset by double clicking its title on the legend pane seen on the right hand side of the plot, so go ahead and give that a go ya crazy goof.\n\nWe can see from the get go that the stars don't vastly stand out from the rest of the league in this metric. All the Top 30 players (seen in red dots as opposed to blue) are kind of jumbled up around the center with the rest of the league's players. Those among the stars that stand out the most are Anthony Davis (made 54.3% of field goals, let in 40.6%), Stephen Curry, Al Horford, and Dwight Howard. However, at least in this metric, even these standout stars pale in comparison to the likes of not-Top 30 players such as Deandre Jordan, Tyson Chandler, and Rudy Gobert. Tony Allen also has his own impressive spot on the plot, with the very low Allowed FG% of 35.5%.\n\nAlso standing out among the stars in a not-so-desirable way are Dirk Nowitzski and Carmelo Anthony, who find themselves at the far end on the wrong side of the Line of Neutrality. Interestingly enough, they are just a couple players within a surprisingly large group of stars who have let in a higher proportion of field goals on defense than they make on offense. Luckily for them they have the likes of Channing Frye (made 39.1% of field goals, let in 51.2%), Trevor Ariza, and Trey Burke to keep them from looking too terribly in this metric.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"731d1e67-92a4-4cf5-911c-a0d3c8c849fa","_uuid":"a183cc4c16a264eb5f7292d20387496c378171f7"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><a id=\"section2\"></a>Average Shot Distance vs. Field Goal %</h1>","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d39bb800-51dd-454f-9d8f-64f4db3c54ce","_uuid":"db0b8b34e6d9b6af21c104c33ad431292825b716"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this section we take a look at players' field goal percentage in accordance with their average shot distance, and once again see if the #NBARank Top 30 set themselves apart form the rest of the league in any way in the resulting plot.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"78ed4561-382e-4cc6-a704-52b246ea1c1c","_uuid":"83b2412b6d0059a4259543e5116cf92356cb209e"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"_cell_guid":"b944af39-24a7-4e72-bb75-3bdb3c8f0f87","_uuid":"4c457f1fcc3c194053a39f3dd83e7d0760972915"},"source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/shot_logs.csv')\ndefenderIDList = list(data['CLOSEST_DEFENDER_PLAYER_ID'].unique())\nattackerIDList = list(data['player_id'].unique())\n\nplayerData = pd.DataFrame(index=playerIDList, columns=['player', 'made', 'missed', 'fg_percentage', \n                                                       'fg_distance'])\n\nfor attackerID in attackerIDList:\n    name= data[(data['player_id'] == attackerID)]['player_name'].iloc[0]\n    spacePos = name.find(' ')\n    firstname = name[0].upper() + name[1:spacePos]\n    lastname = name[spacePos+1].upper() + name[spacePos+2:]\n    name = firstname + ' ' + lastname\n    made = np.sum(data[(data['player_id'] == attackerID)]['SHOT_RESULT']=='made')\n    missed = np.sum(data[(data['player_id'] == attackerID)]['SHOT_RESULT']=='missed')\n    percentage = made/(made+missed)\n    averageDist = np.mean(data[(data['player_id'] == attackerID)]['SHOT_DIST'])\n    playerData.at[attackerID, 'player'] = name\n    playerData.at[attackerID, 'made'] = made\n    playerData.at[attackerID, 'missed'] = missed\n    playerData.at[attackerID, 'fg_percentage'] = percentage\n    playerData.at[attackerID, 'fg_distance'] = averageDist\n    \nnewPlayerData = playerData.sort_values('fg_distance', ascending=False)\nnewPlayerData2 = newPlayerData.drop(newPlayerData[newPlayerData.made < 200].index)\nnewPlayerData2","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you don't mind, I'd just like to take a moment to acknowledge how Kyle Korver's <em><b>average</b></em> field goal distance is just over the distance from the corner of the 3 point line to the basket.

shots per quarter (70 players) is smallest in the first quarter and largest in the fourth. We can take this to infer that players don't necessarily get too hot or cold in the first quarter, and the fourth is where performance really starts to diverge. Also interesting to see is that the number of shots the players make in the quarter (represented by the size of the player's circle) are much higher in the first quarter and get dramatically smaller by the fourth. This can likely be attributed to fewer shot attempts that individual players are comfortable taking up late in the game, where ball-hogging is much less socially acceptable.\n\nThe stars once again find themselves performing very diversely with relation to the rest of the league in this metric. Star standouts on the positive end of the spectrum include Anthony Davis (again) who easily leads the league in field goal percentage in the fourth quarter with a whopping 60.5%, along with Al Horford (56.5%) and Tim Duncan (56.3%). Nikola Vucevic really looks like a 1st quarter player in this plot, by not only having the best 1st quarter field goal percentage among the represented players, but also be among the highest in made 1st quarter field goals (notice his huge circle). Of course, Vucevic's diminishing activity and performance in the remaining quarters doesn't hurt the 1st-quarter-player argument for him either.\n\nStar standouts on the negative end of the spectrum include Kyle Lowry, who finds himself near the bottom of fourth quarter FG% with an abysmal 37.1%, along with Damian Lillard (39.1%) and Derrick Rose (39.2%). To my surprise Klay Thompson and Joe Johnson also can be found alongside them with sub-39% fourth quarter FG percentages. Trey Burke may also have been shooting a little too much in the fourth, and is the only represented player that shot under 33% in the fourth quarter.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b64fc176-40db-4567-9870-501b640fe973","_uuid":"9d07ae264b00fe87afa1a32990cc46504da9b157"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><a id=\"section4\"></a>A Closer Look at the Clutchness of the Top 30</h1>","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"45500a51-1cbb-473c-a361-354b704c6c5c","_uuid":"09a5e34a1b4930dde7374dcccb3ce70385e9ff06"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The prior plot allowed us to see standout anomolies in each quarter, but didn't really give us an easy way of tracking each individual player's flunctuation of FG% between quarters.

Most players such as Lebron James and John Wall don't necessarily follow any sort of clear trend through the quarters, but many stars did have their lowest FG% occuring in the fourth quarter. The only stars that had their highest FG% occuring in the fourth quarter were Anthony Davis, Tim Duncan, Demarcus Cousins, and Serge Ibaka. Carmelo Anthony, who is often considered a clutch star, doesn't necessarily have his highest FG% occuring in the fourth quarter, but does see a rise in FG% there after a decline through the first three quarters. Other players that are often considered clutch stars, such as Kyrie Irving and Chris Paul, had lackluster results in the fourth when observed from the season-wide scale.

space away from the defender, that's actually rarely the case among the stars represented in the above plot. In fact, the only players that actually follow this expectation are Chris Paul and Andre Drummond, who do see increases in field goal percentages along every increasing interval of space given by the defender. Dirk Nowitzki comes close to fulfilling the pattern. Most of the players, on the other hand, have a peak in field goal percentage when shooting a unique distance away from the closest defender. For instance, Al Horford was incredible when shooting with a defender between 3-4 feet away, as he shot over 73% in those cases. However, given one more foot of space by the defender, Horford shot more than 20% lower. It's very possible that there are some confounding variables that explain the anomolies we're observing with this plot, such as certain, closer distances from the defender corresponding with higher percentage shots such as layups and dunks, while further distances from the defender corresponding with lower percentage shots such as jump-shots and three-pointers. Whatever it is, I still like to imagine a scout informing players to make sure they're 4-5 feet, but absolutely not 3-4 feet, from Al Horford when he's shooting.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fd4fd5d1-85b1-43c3-9d09-537901e09a88","_uuid":"4563de03c357b0bdf6eb7a2e126c97fff90da045"}}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","file_extension":".py","version":"3.6.3","name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"}},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","language":"python","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4}

After playing around for a while, 20,000 per million seemed like a good upper range. Interestingly, Mongolia turns black near the end of the animation. I had no idea Mongolia had such an aggressive rollout. Mongolia has now above 40% vaccinated already. The currently have enough vaccines to supply the whole population and are planning a corona free summer. They achieved this by leveraging their neighbors, the superpowers Russia and China. This should give hope to many developing nations around the world. However, simultaneously, they are currently dealing with their worst outbreak to date.

This color range also allowed me to scan quickly for the strongest earthquakes.\n\nAfter some searching, I found an interesting one for you! On the 25th of May there were many earthquakes on the border between Congo and Rwanda. These are tremors following a volcano eruption 3 days earlier nearby (Mount Nyiragongo). This volcano eruption destroyed 17 villages, has killed 17 people and has displaced thousands, and the lava stopped just matter before reaching a town of 2 million people.\n(https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/earthquakes-congo-border-raise-fears-second-volcano-eruption-2021-05-25/)\n\nInteresting to find out about a tragic volcano eruption from an aftershock.\n","metadata":{}}]}

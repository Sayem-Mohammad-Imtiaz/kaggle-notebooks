It **makes ML problem solving process much smoother and clearer** to both us and the machine. In this notebook, we've formed certain level of understanding and insights on the data as follows:\n> 1. The Data is `Biased`\n> 2. Credit History Column has the `highest significance` with the target variable(Loan Status).\n> 3. There are some `Typos in dataset` that leads to bad training(related to observation no. 8) especially in Loan Amount Term column.\n> 4. `Larger population appearing` for loans are Male, Graduate, Not Self-employed, Married and with 0 dependents.\n> 5. People who are Graduated and Not self-employed has `better chances of getting loan.`\n> 6. People with Property area in `Semi-urban places` has `greater chances of loan approval.` \n> 7. People with > 0 Dependents are `mostly Married`\n> 8. There's a slight `linear relationship` of `Loan Amount` with the `Applicant Income`,might be because greater rank business people needs higher loans for higher trades.\n> 9. People with Residual Income of 0 or negative(considering EMI's and number of dependents) have `higher negative Credit History records`. It is also *facinating* that some of those people also gets lucky with the loans.\n> 10. There is `no such thing` as `Higher Applicant Income` gets `higher chances` of receiving `loans`, *however*, people with `low Total Income`(Applicant Income + Co-applicant Income) has `lesser chances` compared to higher people with higher Total Income.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Predict Loan Eligibility for Dream Housing Finance company\n\nI'm going to build an end-to-end machine learning model to classify if someone is eligible for providing loan or not based on certain details.\n\nI'm going to take following approach\n1.

Problem definition\nIn a statement, \n> Given details about a person, we can predict whether a person is eligible to lend loan or not?\n\nBusiness Understanding\n\n> Dream Housing Finance company deals in all kinds of home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first applies for home loan and after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.\n\n> Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have provided a dataset to identify the customers segments that are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.\n\n### 2.

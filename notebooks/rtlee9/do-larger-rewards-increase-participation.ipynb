Furthermore, under this new model, we estimate that **doubling the reward will increase expected submission volumes by roughly 17%** -- smaller than before, but definitely not insubstantial. Similarly, we estimate that **delaying a proposed competition by a year will increase expected submission volumes by roughly 54%**. Other factors, such as competition duration and maximum daily submissions appear to play a negligible role after accounting for time and reward value.\n \n ## Lessons for hosts\nSo what's the lesson for potential competition hosts? Firstly, we found that increasing the competition prize will likely generate additional submissions (roughly 17% more submissions for a doubling of the reward), in turn increasing the likelihood of attaining a better model. We're tempted to feel sorry for those hosts who hosted a competition in Kaggle's early years; they did, after all, receive a fraction of the volume per dollar of prize money spent. At the same time, had they held off hoping for higher volumes as the platform increased in popularity, they would have **foregone years of having a world-class model** -- a high cost indeed!\n \n## Next steps\nThis analysis constitutes a very simple look at the effect of competition reward on submission volume. There are likely other important factors which I didn't look at, including:\n * competition domain: computer vision, traditional ML, etc.\n * organization type: for-profit, public entity, non-profit\n * data structure and general ease-of-use (e.g., kernel-only)\n\nSimilarly, submission counts are only a proxy for what hosts actually care about, which is probably a combination of several things like final model quality, public awareness and perception, etc. Future work might investigate alternative metrics better reflecting these qualities.\n \nLastly, the model we used to quantify the effect of various factors on submission volumes could be further validated (e.g., verify OLS regression assumptions hold, k-fold cross performance validation).","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e5a39836-75e3-4459-bc99-eae447885366","_uuid":"98462607276d68e5d8073e7ecff776081c54c113"}}],"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"mimetype":"text/x-python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","file_extension":".py","version":"3.6.4"},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"}},"nbformat_minor":1}

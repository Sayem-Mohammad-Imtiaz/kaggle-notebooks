It is actually shocking how high the mortality rate on the Philippines is. The second in line is San Marino a microstate (population of 33,400 ) within Italy. This is interesting as a few days ago the mortality was 5% as well however with a much lower case number. The overall cases have now increased and so have the deaths but the mortality rate appears to be the same. Italy on the other hand that surrounds San Marino only has a lower mortality rate. Explanations could be that the demographics are different. This is the case however Italy has with 21% of the population over the age of 65, an older population than San Marino (16%). Another explanation could be differences in the provision of healthcare which is very difficult to assess.

CRIM - per capita crime rate by town\n2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n6. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling\n7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways\n10. TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000\n\n11. PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town\n12. B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town\n13.

There are around 17.2 million questions on the platform with 8K–10K new questions asked every day. While a lot of these questions are unique, I believe that a lot of questions are repeated, so it would be interesting to see what similar questions are asked most frequently. \n\nThe topic of frequent questions extraction is somewhat connected to my Master's Thesis which I'm currently writing, so these kernels will reflect my progress in terms of research in this area. \n\nThis notebook will attempt to answer the question __How can we embed sentences in such a way that similar questions will appear closer to each other as measured by cosine distance?__ by comparing two embedding methods __Centroid Method__ and __Doc2Vec__. \n\n\n\n## Imports and Data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport gensim\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\nfrom gensim.utils import simple_preprocess\nfrom gensim.models import FastText\nfrom gensim.models import TfidfModel\nfrom gensim.corpora import Dictionary\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/Questions.csv', encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\", nrows=30000, usecols=['Id', 'Title', 'Body'])\ndf.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"906ef06f075087ed5e55c7389674412ba763fee8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's take a look at some of the questions\nprint('Question1: ', df.iloc[0, 2])\nprint('Question2: ', df.iloc[1, 2])\nprint('Question3: ', df.iloc[2, 2])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"97b48209e063f56a31206be254614ed4c573e790"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, some questions can be quite long and elaborate while others are just asking for recommendations.

There's still engough information for the models to learn context, and the noice is reduced. \n\n## Sentence Embedding \nAs a first approach, I will be using a so called __centroid method__ to dervie the sentence embeddings (taken from this research paper http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/BioNLP_2016.pdf). It derives sentence embeddings as the sum of individual word embeddings in a sentece weighted by their tf-idf score, and divided by the sum of these tf-idf scores.  For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to be compare just two alternatives for word embeddings Word2Vec and FastText. I'll be using gensim implementations of both.\n\n## Word2Vec\nWord2Vec model learns vector representation of a word by either predicting the context around it (skip-gram), or predicting a word based on its context (CBoW). The most important parameters to specify here are the size of embbedding vector and the size of context window. The number of dimensions is usually between 100-300, with 128 being a standard choice for a lot of applications. Context window depends on the nature of text and embbeddings that you want to get. We'll start with context of 5, and see if the embbedings make sense. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"e2283facaf0ef42a0d13d625415f0ff264e9bfbf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Instantiating the model\nn = 50\nmodel = Word2Vec(filtered_questions, size = n, window = 8)\n\n#Training model using questions corpora\nmodel.train(filtered_questions, total_examples=len(filtered_questions), epochs=10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"db7fb288145cd48d9efa64b0c11ee018623fd152"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's inspect the results by looking at the most similar words (vectors) of a word 'array' and 'database''"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ecfe822d97fc72b0d457516ab2a05c4c132fb63a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Let's see how it worked\nword_vectors = model.wv\n\nprint('Words similar to \"array\" are: ', word_vectors.most_similar(positive='array'))\nprint('Words similar to \"database\" are: ', word_vectors.most_similar(positive='database'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"780745ccb9b0fd02bcefb32760bfde3db044fe9e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looks like word2vec knows that array is related to list, matrix, and is commonly used in context of slicing.

It is a very hopeful thought for many people, including me.\n\nThis was a project I developed in the previous weeks as part of a certificate that I desired to get. When I encountered this dataset I knew, that I desired to do an EDA (exploratory data analysis) for it, as I found that it was very useful information, that many people would want to know in a comfortable and comprehensible fashion. \nThis was the primary motivation of this project, as well as, being able to analyze and comprehend how the world is going and getting along with the global vaccination.\n\nParticularly, I intended to analyze this data for my home country, Mexico. This, for us Mexicans, to understand how our government is achieving this global pandemic, and how can we compare to neighboring nations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Technologies/Libraries Used\n\nFor this project I used mainly the following resources:\n1.

Finally, Plotly is an incredible tool for data visualization. \n\nEverything in this notebook was programmed in Python","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install cufflinks\n!pip

They have won more trophies than any other club in English football, with a record 20 League titles, 12 FA Cups, 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. United have also won three UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA Europa League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1998–99, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental European treble. By winning the UEFA Europa League in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions, and the only English club to have won every ongoing top-flight honour available to them.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson has been the most successful manager for the club.  Sir Alex won 38 trophies as manager, including 13 Premier League titles, 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues, between 1986 and 2013, when he announced his retirement. \n\nDavid Moyes then took over in 2013, a time of tumult  for the club  after SAF decided to step down. Hailed as the perfect successor to Sir Alex, he was sacked after one season, due to lack of performance. \n\nThen came in Louis Van Gaal, the famous coach for an once-all star team of Netherlands and Bayern Munich, in 2014. The tenure of his stay was 2 years and he was sacked in 2016, in the face of huge protests of fans and was accused of destroying Manchester United's signature style of play. \n\nFollowing this, the club roped in Jose Mourinho for the job, an extremely controversial person for many reasons, a man who had won the Champions League with Porto and the Premier League with Chelsea, a 'man of heavy words', as many of his critics say. \n\nWere Moyes and Van Gaal really worth their salt? Did Mourinho really bring back the glory days back or can he still now? Did Manchester United find the _perfect successor_ for SAF? \n\n**So, how did each of the new managers fare in their newly appointed duties? A duty, which demands great responsibility and Herculean to say the least, the duty to instill fear in the minds of opponents whenever they say their name, the duty to bring back the team to their former glory as the 'Red Devils', and to reign in The Theatre of Dreams.**\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"52ae4db81bbdd9e7e81ee7841b82a1d304140b4e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\n\n# **Importing the dataset**"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/stats.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7d68f12caef894aaa64633b991f793187cd23187","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4bbd57d31f46ca8f105fe4a98c7a2adf12fd7dbd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **General Overview of Wins and Losses for Manchester United from seasons 2006-07 to 2017-18**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d9fd248da1364c8c03b0c657eb877faeb1890fc4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## A.

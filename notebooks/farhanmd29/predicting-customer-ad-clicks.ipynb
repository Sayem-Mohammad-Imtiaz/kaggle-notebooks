The data consists of 10 variables: 'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Male', 'Country', Timestamp' and 'Clicked on Ad'.\n\nThe main variable we are interested in is 'Clicked on Ad'. This variable can have two possible outcomes: 0 and 1 where 0 refers to the case where a user didn't click the advertisement, while 1 refers to the scenario where a user clicks the advertisement.\n\nWe will see if we can use the other 9 variables to accurately predict the value 'Clicked on Ad' variable. We will also perform some exploratory data analysis to see how 'Daily Time Spent on Site' in combination with 'Ad Topic Line' affects the user's decision to click on the add."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import data\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/advertising.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Based on the first lines in the table, we can get a basic insight into the data we are working with.

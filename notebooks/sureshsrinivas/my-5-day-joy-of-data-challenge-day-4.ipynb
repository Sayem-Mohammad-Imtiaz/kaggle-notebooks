The survey received over 16,000 responses with over 6 full months of aggregated time spent completing it (an average response time of more than 16 minutes). In this notebook I will look at this data to understand how these survey respondents are learning so I can learn from that.\n \nFirst let us load up the Data. What does this tell us? Majority of respondents are men. This is not too surprising from our earlier kernel on[ gender gap](https://www.kaggle.com/sureshsrinivas/my-5-day-joy-of-data-challenge-day-1).  So let us split the data and see them seperately.\n* Total Respondents =  16716\n* Women Respondents =  2778\n* Men Respondents =  13610"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2f3761b4-782c-4db1-9f58-fb690ed91dbd","_uuid":"f1f65d844fa20dcc5965008dfbc780f083e949c6"},"outputs":[],"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\n#print(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\ncvRates = pd.read_csv('../input/conversionRates.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\nfreeForm = pd.read_csv('../input/freeformResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/multipleChoiceResponses.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\nschema = pd.read_csv('../input/schema.csv', encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\")\n\n\nwomen_data = data.loc[data['GenderSelect'] == 'Female']\nmen_data = data.loc[data['GenderSelect'] == 'Male']\nprint('Total Respondents = ', len(data.index))\nprint('Women Respondents = ', len(women_data.index))\nprint('Men Respondents = ', len(men_data.index))\n\nwomen_data['FirstTrainingSelect'].head(3)\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"eaeddfb8-dbaa-477d-83d8-60a5b5358cdb","_uuid":"8b3e118f577087c95929dae9a26683ae73d54bf7"},"source":""},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"643267a1-389e-4147-91c6-a80072ee07fd","_uuid":"d74379dce07810c32e6dae4cac13ba842d939eb4"},"source":"## How are Kagglers Learning?\n\nLet us plot this using `sns.countplot` to plot.

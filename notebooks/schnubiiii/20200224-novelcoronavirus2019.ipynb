[Link to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2)\n\nThe virus is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus from the family of Coronaviridae. The name comes from the ,,envelope\" structure formed by the SEM proteins looking under a microscope like a crown (corona). \nIn November 2019 supposedly the virus migrated from an animal and infected a human in Wuhan, China where the animal was sold on a food marked. Up to now it is not clear what kind of animal was the carrier of the virus. During the following month the virus spread from China to more than 80 countries around the globe. \nFew facts are known about the transmission, the symptoms and the sevierity of the infection. But the american CDC states that it is transmitted by water droplets spread by the infected patients while sneezing an coughing and therefore is not airborne. In human it infects mostly the upper resperatory systems but can as well lead do severe cases up to the death of the patient. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Investigation of the Datasets"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First and foremost we investigae the datasets individually, using the head, describe and info method of pandas"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_conf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_deaths.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_recov.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_conf.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_deaths.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_recov.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_conf.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_deaths.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_recov.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**NOTES**\n\nin some cases the 'Province/State' column has no entry when the region inside of a country is not known.

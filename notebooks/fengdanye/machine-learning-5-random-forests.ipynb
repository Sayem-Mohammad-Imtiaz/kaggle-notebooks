The four leaf nodes (depth=2) each predicts a class - two of them predict class_2, one predicts class_1 and one predicts class_0. You can also see other node attributes such as \"gini\"and \"value\" shown in the graph. These attributes are explained below:\n\n* In each node, **\"samples\"** represents how many training instances fall in that node. For example, there are 67 samples that has proline > 755.0. \n* The attribute **\"value\"** gives how many instances fall in each class for each node.

The splitting criterion consists of a feature $k$ and a threshold for this feature $t_k$, which are selected by minimizing an impurity cost function:\n<center>\n    $J(k, t_k) = G_{\\mathrm {left}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {left}}}/{m}+ G_{\\mathrm {right}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {right}}}/{m}$\n</center>\nThis is a **weighted sum of the gini impurity of the left and right child node**. Here $G_{\\mathrm {left}}$ ($G_{\\mathrm {right}}$) is the gini impurity of the left(right) child node, $m_{\\mathrm {left}}$ ($m_{\\mathrm {right}}$) is the number of samples in the left (right) child node, and $m$ is the number of samples in the parent node $m = m_{\\mathrm {left}} + m_{\\mathrm {right}}$. The algorithm will first split the root node into two, then split each of the two children nodes into two, and so on. The process usually stops if the tree has reached its user-defined maximum depth, or if the after-split impurity $G_{\\mathrm {left}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {left}}}/{m}+ G_{\\mathrm {right}}\\times{m_{\\mathrm {right}}}/{m}$ is bigger than the partent node's impurity $G_{\\mathrm{parent}}$, but other stopping criteria exist, too.\n\nThere are several things I'd like to point out about this algorithm and sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier:\n* The CART algorithm is a greedy algorithm that searches for **locally optimal decisions**. Optimal split is searched at each node, *without* considering whether it leads to a globally smallest impurity at the bottom of the tree. This is also mentioned in DecisionTreeClassifier's [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree).\n* Given the algorithm, which DecisionTreeClassifier follows if using default settings, a deterministic result is expected given a certain training set (i.e. no randomness). However, **DecisionTreeClassifier does display randomness even at default settings**. This is because the classifier will randomly re-order all features and then test each of them. If two splits are tied, the one that happened first will be selected. More discussion can be found on this [github page](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/8443).\n* To accelerate to training, you may set max_features of DecisionTreeClassifier to be smaller than the total number of features. In this case, the algorithm will search the best split from a randomly sampled subset of features.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d09bd0928aeed7ec5d1dbedcee3ba1503e3640a1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Overfitting and regularization\nWithout regulation, **decision tree classifier will easily overfit**.

Anyways, I have fixed the problem by reducing the searched parameters from \"'max_features': [0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0], 'max_depth': [2,3,4,5,6,7],'min_samples_leaf':[1,10,100]\" to \"'max_features': [0.5,0.7,0.9], 'max_depth': [3,5,7],'min_samples_leaf':[1,10]\". This does not affect the training outcome.\n* Added an appendix to explain the CART algorithm for decision tree training. This is also important for understanding of the boosting algorithm introduced in Tutorial #7."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9355abbe02f40f5beda892b3168bea1e1272d294"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---------------------------------------------\nPlease upvote the notebook if you enjoyed this tutorial :) If you have any questions or comments, let me know!\n\nFor my previous tutorials, please see:\n* [Machine Learning 1 - Regression, Gradient Descent](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-1-regression-gradient-descent)\n* [Machine Learning 2 Regularized LM, Early Stopping](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-2-regularized-lm-early-stopping)\n* [Machine Learning 3 Logistic and Softmax Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-3-logistic-and-softmax-regression)\n* [Machine Learning 4 Support Vector Machine](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-4-support-vector-machine)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

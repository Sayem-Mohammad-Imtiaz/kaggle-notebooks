These weak learners usually belong to the same class, e.g. decision trees. Boosting algorithms try to find the optimal linear combination of $M$ weak learners from the same class to minimize prediction error. These weak learners can be considered a set of **basis functions**. The mathematical expression is:\n<center>\n$F(x)=f_0(x)+\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\theta_m \\phi_m(x)$\n</center>\nWhere $F(x)$ is the prediction of target value given $x$, $M$ is the number of weak leaners in the ensemble, and $f_0(x)$ is an intial guess. The $\\phi_m(x)$ are the weak learners, and $\\theta_m$ are the coefficients.\n\nThere are many types of boosting techniques. The first practical boosting algorithm is (generally believed to be) <font color='blue'>Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)</font>. Then, there are <font color='blue'>Gradient Boosting (GBM)</font>, which correpsonds to gradient descent in function space, and <font color='blue'>XGBoost</font> which correpsonds to Newton's optimization method in function space.

Later, the technique was expanded to multi-class classification ([Zhu et al. 2006](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/samme.pdf)) and regression ([Drucker 1997](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d49/e2dedb817f2c3330e74b63c5fc86d2399ce3.pdf)). We will go through them one by one.\n### Classification\n#### Binary-class AdaBoost\nAssuming we have $n$ samples in the training set, the algorithm starts by initializing equal weights for each training sample:\n<center>\n    $w_i=\\frac{1}{n}, i=1,2,...,n$\n</center>\nThen:\n* For $m = 1$ to $M$:\n    * Fit a classifier $T^{(m)}(x)$ to the training data using weights [$w_1$, $w_2$,..., $w_n$]. The higher the weights, the more the classifier tries to get the corresponding samples right. Mathematically speaking, the weak learnerâ€™s goal is to find $T^{(m)}(x)$ which minimizes the training error $\\mathrm{Pr}_{i \\sim w_i}[y_i \\neq T^{(m)}(x_i)]$ . Note that this error is measured with respect to the distribution {$w_i$} that was provided to the\nweak learner.\n    * Compute **weighted error rate** of the current classifier: $err^{(m)}=\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\mathrm{I}(y_i \\neq T^{(m)}(x_i))/\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$. Here $y_i$ is the true label of sample $x_i$. The $\\mathrm{I}(y_i \\neq T^{(m)}(x_i))$ is 1 if  $y_i \\neq T^{(m)}(x_i)$, and 0 otherwise.\n    * Compute the **classifier weight** in the ensemble: $\\alpha^{(m)}=\\mathrm{log}((1-err^{(m)})/err^{(m)})$. The smaller the error rate, the more influential the classifier is.\n    * **Update sample weights** to boost the incorrectly classified samples: $w_i \\leftarrow w_i \\cdot exp[\\alpha^{(m)}\\cdot \\mathrm{I}(y_i \\neq T^{(m)}(x_i))]$, $i=1,2,...,n$. That is, the misclassified samples have larger weight (when $\\alpha^{(m)}>0$).\n    * Re-normalize sample weights: $w_i \\leftarrow w_i/\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$.\n* Output: $\\hat{y}(x) = \\underset{k}{\\operatorname{argmax}}\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\alpha^{(m)} \\mathrm{I}(T^{(m)}(x) = k)$. The prediction is based on the weighted majority of votes. Here $k=0$ or $1$.\n    \nThe take-away is that **AdaBoost trains one classifier at a time to focus on the previously misclassified cases. The classifiers with lower error rates have larger weights (more votes) in final prediction**. Obviously there are many ways to penalize misclassified cases - why is the algorithm specifically written in this way? You will see in the later section that this algorithm is equivalent to the broadly used forward stagewise additive modeling (FSAM) in boosting algorithms with an exponential loss function. For now, understanding the above algorithm is enough for you to proceed."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"31653dea82a9509e6456d575c49672935c34f45e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Multi-class AdaBoost (SAMME)\n**You might have noticed that for the binary-class algorithm to actually increase the weights for misclassified samples, $\\alpha^{(m)}$ should be positive**. This means the error rate $err^{(m)}$ should be smaller than $1/2$. For a binary classification, this is not two hard to satisfy, since the random error rate with equal sample weights is $1/2$. However, for a $K$-class classification ($K>2$), the random error rate becomes $(K-1)/K$, and $\\alpha^{(m)}$ is more likely to be negative. This is a major reason why the previous algorithm does not tend to work well in multi-class cases. To fix this issue, [Zhu et al. 2006](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/samme.pdf) proposed to change the expression of $\\alpha^{(m)}$ to:\n<center>\n    $\\alpha^{(m)}=\\mathrm{log}\\frac{1-err^{(m)}}{err^{(m)}} + log(K-1)$\n</center>\nThe additional $log(K-1)$ term makes sure $\\alpha^{(m)}$ is positive as long as the error rate $err^{(m)}$ is smaller than $(K-1)/K$. **This algorithm is refered to as the <font color='blue'>*SAMME*</font> algorithm**. *SAMME* stands for *Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multi-class Exponential loss function*. We will explain where the name comes from in a later section. When $K=2$, SAMME reduces to binary-class AdaBoost.

The algorithm goes as follows:\n* Intialize weights $w_i=1/n$, $i=1,2,..., n$\n* Initalize iteration number $m=0$.\n* Repeat below while average loss $\\bar{L}$ (defined below) is less than 0.5:\n    * Increment iteration number $m = m +1$.\n    * **Pick $n$ samples with replacement to form the training set for this iteration. Note that for each pick the probability that sample $x_i$ is chosen is $w_i$**.\n    * Train a base regressor on the bootstrapped training set. The trained regressor predicts $\\hat{y}^{(m)}_i$ on sample $x_i$.\n    * Calculate the **loss for each training sample**: $L_i^{(m)} = L(y_i, \\hat{y}^{(m)}_i) = L(|y_i-\\hat{y}^{(m)}_i|)$. The default of **Sklean's <font color='green'>AdaBoostRegressor()</font>** is $L_i = |y_i-\\hat{y}^{(m)}_i|/sup (|y_i-\\hat{y}^{(m)}_i|)$, where $sup$ stands for supremum.\n    * Calculate **average loss** of this regressor: $\\bar{L}^{(m)}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_iL_i^{(m)}$.\n    * Calculate **confidence** of this regressor: $\\beta^{(m)}=\\mathrm{log}((1-\\bar{L}^{(m)})/\\bar{L}^{(m)})$. The smaller the average loss, the more \"confident\" the regressor is. This is similar to the $\\alpha^{(m)}$ in AdaBoost classification.\n    * Update **sample weights**: $w_i \\leftarrow w_i \\cdot exp[\\beta^{(m)} \\cdot (L_i^{(m)}-1)]$, $i=1,2,...,n$. In classification, we multiply misclassified sample weights by $exp(\\alpha^{(m)})$. Here in regression, the multiplication is $exp[\\beta^{(m)} \\cdot (L_i^{(m)}-1)]$. The larger the sample loss $L_i^{(m)}$, the more \"misclassified\" this sample is.\n    * Re-normalize sample weights: $w_i \\leftarrow w_i/\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i$.\n* We ended up with $M$ trained regressors that each improves on the previous.\n* Output:\n    * Given a test sample $x$, and $M$ trained regressors from the previous step, we obtain a prediction from each regressor: $\\hat{y}^{(1)}$, $\\hat{y}^{(2)}$, ..., $\\hat{y}^{(M)}$.\n    * The weighted median of $\\hat{y}^{(1)}$, $\\hat{y}^{(2)}$, ..., $\\hat{y}^{(M)}$ given weights $\\beta^{(1)}$, $\\beta^{(2)}$, ..., $\\beta^{(M)}$ is the final prediction. You can obtain the weighted median as follows:\n        * Re-label the regressors so that $\\hat{y}^{(1)} < \\hat{y}^{(2)} < ... < \\hat{y}^{(M)}$. Re-label the weights $\\beta^{(1)}$, $\\beta^{(2)}$, ..., $\\beta^{(M)}$ accordingly.\n        * Sum up $\\beta$s until we reach the *smallest* $m$ that satisfies $\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\beta^{(i)}\\geq 1/2 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\beta^{(i)}$.\n        * $\\hat{y}^{(m)}$ is the final prediction of the ensemble.\n\n\nNote that each iteration is more \"difficult\" than the previous, which means the subsequent regressor is harder to train than the previous. Therefore, the average loss $\\bar{L}$ tends to increase with interations, and finally the algorihtm terminates when $\\bar{L}$ exceeds the bound. The above algorithm is based on [Drucker 1997](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8d49/e2dedb817f2c3330e74b63c5fc86d2399ce3.pdf).

The Random Forest classifier had 500.\n* The learning rate is too high, which makes the weights of misclassified samples increase too rapidly. This makes the AdaBoost easily overfits to high-weight samples.

Random Forest also has ways of introducing randomness for each tree to avoid overfitting.\n* The SAMME.R algorithm performs better than SAMME (however, you won't be able to print meaningful estimator weights when using SAMME.R).\n\nI also find it interesting to think that Random Forest introduces *randomness* into different trees with bagging and feature subsampling, whereas AdaBoost also introduces some types of variability between trees but do so by introducing *focus* on the previously misclassified cases and less accurate classifiers are penalized.

It is very commonly used in current practice and it usually presents satisfying performance. Before proceeding, you should read the Appendix in [tutorial 5](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-5-random-forests), if you haven't done so. Recall that in the Appendix of  [tutorial 5](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-5-random-forests), we learned that a decision tree can be expressed as:\n<center>\n$f(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{T} w_j {\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_j)$\n</center>\nwhere $w_j$ is called the **weight** of *j*th leaf node, and $\\{R_j\\} ( j=1,2,...,T)$ is called the **structure** of the tree. The $T$ is the number of leaf nodes of this tree. The ${\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_j)$ equals one if sample $x$ belongs to area $R_j$, and zero otherwise. With decision trees as the base learners, the additive model of $F(x)$ can be expressed as:\n<center>\n $F(x)=f_0(x) + \\sum_{m=1}^{M}f_m(x) = f_0(x) + \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m}w_{jm}{\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_{jm})$  \n</center>\n\n**Just like what we did in the general GBM algorithm, at each iteration $m$, we want to align the base learner trees with the negative gradients. The cost of such alignment is again the sum of squared loss**:\n<center>\n$J_m = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\left(-g_m(x_i)\\right) - \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} w_{jm}{\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_{jm}) \\right) \\right]^2 = const +  \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ 2g_m(x_i) \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} w_{jm}{\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_{jm}) +  \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} w_{jm}^2{\\mathrm I}(x\\in R_{jm}) \\right]$\n</center>\nThe above sum over samples can be substituted by a sum over the leaf nodes:\n<center>\n$J_m = const +  \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} \\sum_{i; \\ x_i \\in R_{jm}}\\left[ 2g_m(x_i) w_{jm} +w_{jm}^2 \\right] = const +  \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} \\left[ 2 \\left( \\sum_{i; \\ x_i \\in R_{jm}} g_m(x_i) \\right) w_{jm} +  \\sum_{i; \\ x_i \\in R_{jm}}w_{jm}^2\\right]$\n</center>\nIf we define $G_{jm} = \\sum_{i; \\ x_i \\in R_jm} g_m(x_i)$, define the number of samples belonging to region $R_{jm}$ (leaf node $j$) as $n_{jm}$, discard the constant in $J_m$, and divide $J_m$ by 2 (none of these will change the optimization result), the cost can be expressed as:\n<center>\n$J_m =  \\sum_{j=1}^{T_m} \\left[  G_{jm} w_{jm} +  \\frac{1}{2}n_{jm}w_{jm}^2\\right]$\n</center>\nThis cost function will be used to train a decision tree.\n\nTo train a tree, we follow the CART algorithm introduced in the Appendix of [tutorial 5](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-5-random-forests). **The algorithm first decides the weights given a fixed structure, and then learn the structure given the weights**.

For example, you can set maximum number of leaf nodes allowed. You can also limit the total number of trees in the ensemble $M$.\n2. **Random subsampling**.  Similar to the bagging method introduced in the [last tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/fengdanye/machine-learning-6-basic-ensemble-learning), we can randomly subsample from the training set to train each tree. That is, different subsamples of the training set are used to train different trees in the ensemble. The difference between bagging and the random subsampling here is that here we sample *without* replacement. In Sklearn's gradient boosting functions, the subsampling fraction is the parameter called \"subsample\". When the subsampling fraction is smaller than $1.0$, the model is called <font color='blue'>stochastic gradient boosting</font>."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a8e223e6b2df800d46d49836a54d40cf9a9587a2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Sklearn functions and examples\nSklearn provides the following functions for gradient tree boosting:\n* **GradientBoostingClassifier()**\n* **GradientBoostingRegressor()**\n\nOne very important parameter for the functions is the definition of the **loss function** $L(y, F)$ (parameter \"loss\" in sklearn). In fact, **the algorithm for gradient boosting classification and regression only differ in the loss function they use**. The Sklearn [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting) has a full list of loss functions for classification and regression in section \"1.11.4.5.1. Loss Functions\". The default loss function for <font color='green'>GradientBoostingClassifier()</font> is the negative binomial log-likelihood loss function (\"deviance\") for binary classification. The default loss function for <font color='green'>GradientBoostingRegressor()</font> is the squared loss (\"ls\"). Note that if the loss function is set to the exponential loss (\"exponential\"), the gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\nThe **learning_rate** parameter corresponds to the $\\eta$ in the above algorithms. The **n_estimator** is the number of trees in the ensemble and corresponds to the $M$ in the above algorithms. The **subsample** is the subsampling ratio for stochastic gradient boosting.

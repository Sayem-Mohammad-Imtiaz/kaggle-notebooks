When we see features that mean some characteristics out of the image such as \n* radius\n* cells\n* texture\n* perimeter\n* area\n* smoothness\n\nWe feed all these features into kind of our machine learning model.\n\n**MAIN PART:**  We want to teach the machine how to basically classify images or classify data and tell us if it's malignant or benign.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **PROBLEM IN MACHINE LEARNING VOCABULARY**\n\n*Input:* 30 features \n* Radius\n* Texture\n* Perimeter\n* Area\n* Smoothness\n* ...\n\n*Target Class:* 2 \n* Malignant\n* Benign\n\n*How many datasets we have? :* \n* Number of Instances: 569\n* Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign\n\n*Data source:*\n* [Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)\n* [Breast Cancer Detection with Reduced Feature Set](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271907638_Breast_Cancer_Detection_with_Reduced_Feature_Set)\n\n\nWe're going to say: if you look at all these features then indicate that cancer which is denoted by a zero, is malignant in this case.\n\nAnd then, If we look at the 30 features that may be classified as one, this cancer type is kind of benign.\n\nSo it's a kind of binary detection indicating zero or one for malignant or benign.\n\n---\n**SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE CLASSIFIER**\n\nNear the maximum Margin Hyperplane, we don't know whether this cancer is malignant or benign. \n\nThat's why the support vector machine classifier is very unique in this sense. It simply uses the points or the support vectors that are on the boundary to draw the boundary out to classify the classes.\n\nSupport vector machines are really powerful techniques.\nWhy?

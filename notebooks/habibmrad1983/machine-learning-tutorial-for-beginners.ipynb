Basic Tools: Like python, R or SQL. You do not need to know everything. What you only need is to learn how to use **python**\n1. Basic Statistics: Like mean, median or standart deviation. If you know basic statistics, you can use **python** easily. \n1. Data Munging: Working with messy and difficult data. Like a inconsistent date and string formatting. As you guess, **python** helps us.\n1. Data Visualization: Title is actually explanatory. We will visualize the data with **python** like matplot and seaborn libraries.\n1. Machine Learning: You do not need to understand math behind the machine learning technique. You only need is understanding basics of machine learning and learning how to implement it while using **python**.\n\n### As a summary we will learn python to be data scientist !!!\n## For parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, look at DATA SCIENCE TUTORIAL for BEGINNERS\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/data-sciencetutorial-for-beginners/\n## In this tutorial, I am not going to learn machine learning to you, I am going to explain how to learn something by yourself.\n# *Confucius: Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

The name stands for t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. The idea is to embed high-dimensional points in low dimensions in a way that respects similarities between points.\n\n\n* What is T SNE used for?\n\n> **What is t-SNE**? (t-SNE) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm used for exploring high-dimensional data. It maps multi-dimensional data to two or more dimensions suitable for human observation.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding\n\n> T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm for visualization developed by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton.[1] It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions. Specifically, it models each high-dimensional object by a two- or three-dimensional point in such a way that similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability.\n\n> The t-SNE algorithm comprises two main stages. First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a lower probability. Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. While the original algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity metric, this can be changed as appropriate.\n\n> t-SNE has been used for visualization in a wide range of applications, including computer security research,[2] music analysis,[3] cancer research,[4] bioinformatics,[5] and biomedical signal processing.[6] It is often used to visualize high-level representations learned by an artificial neural network.[7]\n\n> While t-SNE plots often seem to display clusters, the visual clusters can be influenced strongly by the chosen parameterization and therefore a good understanding of the parameters for t-SNE is necessary. Such \"clusters\" can be shown to even appear in non-clustered data,[8] and thus may be false findings. Interactive exploration may thus be necessary to choose parameters and validate results.[9][10] It has been demonstrated that t-SNE is often able to recover well-separated clusters, and with special parameter choices, approximates a simple form of spectral clustering.\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/t-sne-implementation-r-python/\n1. https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-t-sne-with-python-example-5a3a293108d1\n1. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/t-sne-implementation-r-python/\n1. https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/pca-vs-t-sne-17bcd882bf3d","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4166039422a3ed14b4ac779da29401378dfb4dc2","_cell_guid":"15b4f98e-0c9e-49de-b69f-f583524c19ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"15\"></a> <br>\n### T - Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T - SNE)\n * learning rate: 50-200 in normal\n * fit_transform: it is both fit and transform. t-sne has only have fit_transform\n * Varieties have same position relative to one another","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data2.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x[:10]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y[:10]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What is manifold in deep learning?**\n> A manifold is an object of dimensionality d that is embedded in some higher dimensional space.

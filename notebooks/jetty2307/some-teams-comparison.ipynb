In the first case, we can observe it, when a country plays against a part of the country itself. For example, here we can see that Catalonia plays against Spain in Barcelona. The game is marked as an away game for Spain (3rd column), played in Spain (8th column), not on a neutral field (9th column). Despite the possible confusion, the entire note is basically correct, as in this case, the field in Barcelona can indeed be considered more a 'home' field for Catalonia than for Spain. The same situation applies to the games between Silesia and Poland played in Silesian region of Poland. So we should not change anything in this case.\n\nIn the second case, games are played between two explicitly different countries - e.g. between Peru and Brazil (last row). The game was played in San Paolo, Brazil, but it is marked as a neutral game for both teams (apparently, because Brazil hosted the tournament - and all games therein were marked as neutral). I think, one can reach a consensus that such a game should be defined as a home game for Brazil.

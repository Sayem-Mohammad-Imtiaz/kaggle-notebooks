The speed of K-NN can be explained by the fact that this algorithm is a lazy learner and does not do much during training process unlike other classifiers that build the models. The performance of K-NN will be examined tuning the algorithm and applying various preprocessing steps.\n#### Evaluation of the algorithm\nAccuracy, i.e. the fraction of correct predictions is typically not enough information to evaluate a model. Although it is a starting point, it can lead to invalid decisions. Models with high accuracy may have inadequate precision or recall scores. For this reason the evaluation metrics that were also assessed are:\n* Precision or the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative. The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. In our study case, precision is when the algorithm guesses that a cell is malignant and actually measures how certain we are that this cell is a true malignant. For example, a precision of 0.9 means that if the model predicts 100 malignant cells, the 90 of them are malignant and the rest 10 are benign (false).\n* Recall or the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. In context to the study, recall shows how well our identifier can find the malignant cells. For example, a low recall score of 0.8 indicates that our identifier finds only 80% of all the real malignant cells in the prediction. The rest 20% of real malignant cells will not be found by the diagnosis based on this algorithm, something that is unacceptable.\n* F1 score, a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are equal. The formula for the F1 score is: F1 = 2 x (precision x recall) / (precision + recall).","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom time import time\n\ndef print_ml_results():\n    t0 = time()\n\n    # Create classifier.\n    clf = KNeighborsClassifier()\n\n    # Fit the classifier on the training features and labels.\n    t0 = time()\n    clf.fit(features_train, labels_train)\n    print(\"Training time:\", round(time()-t0, 3), \"s\")\n\n    # Make predictions.\n    t1 = time()\n    predictions = clf.predict(features_test)\n    print(\"Prediction time:\", round(time()-t1, 3), \"s\")\n\n    # Evaluate the model.\n    accuracy = clf.score(features_test, labels_test)\n    report = classification_report(labels_test, predictions)\n\n    # Print the reports.\n    print(\"\\nReport:\\n\")\n    print(\"Accuracy: {}\".format(accuracy))\n    print(\"\\n\", report)\n    print(confusion_matrix(labels_test, predictions))\n\nprint_ml_results()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5a224a34-5539-4715-a030-5b244ff7e858","_uuid":"6f957b4090b6a73104f0f56c673888dd1a19b441","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d584d4f5-7abb-4db3-af55-7b16351d0660","_uuid":"46a7c4469edb378c242252431e27fe8d429a024a"},"source":"* The algorithm will be tuned to achieve an improved performance, especially a better recall score for the malignant class, since 90% can be considered a low recall score in this case.\n\n#### Remove Highly Correlated Features and Run Again\nInvestigate if removing manually features with a correlation higher than 0.8, can benefit the algorithm performance, although later this will be handled automatically by dimensionality reduction.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"df_new = df[['diagnosis', 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', 'smoothness_mean',\n            'compactness_mean', 'symmetry_mean', 'fractal_dimension_mean',\n            'radius_se', 'texture_se', 'smoothness_se',\n            'compactness_se', 'concave points_se', 'symmetry_se',\n            'fractal_dimension_se', 'concavity_worst', 'symmetry_worst',\n            'fractal_dimension_worst']]\n\narray = df_new.values\n\n# Define the independent variables as features.\nfeatures_new = array[:,1:]\n\n# Define the target (dependent) variable as labels.\nlabels_new = array[:,0]\n\n# Create a train/test split using 30% test size.\nfeatures_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(features_new, labels_new, \\\n                                                                            test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\nprint_ml_results()","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"31ca22e8-6291-47a7-83c4-34b5af70b9de","_uuid":"a25b96437b94259cfd72d1d949b836ad28a5b825","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3ab2d805-644e-4a98-a244-808ac0cc75ec","_uuid":"eed315eba285b0bc624e218750c78bb9d0da7248"},"source":"There is a significant decrease in algorithm's accuracy and recall mostly for the malignant class.

This will result in overfitting. To avoid this, cross validation is applied. There are several cross validation methods such as K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold.\n\nIn K-Fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k-1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times (the folds), with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds can then be averaged to produce a single estimation. The advantage of this method over repeated random sub-sampling is the increased accuracy because all observations are used for both training and validation, and each observation is used for validation exactly once.\n\nIf the original data comes in some sort of sorted shape, a shuffle of the order of the data points is necessary before splitting them up into folds. This can be done in `KFold()`, setting the `shuffle` parameter to `True`. If there are concerns about class imbalance, then the `StratifiedKFold()` class should be used instead. Where `KFold()` assigns points to folds without attention to output class, `StratifiedKFold()` assigns data points to folds so that each fold has approximately the same number of data points of each output class. This is most useful for when we have imbalanced numbers of data points in the outcome classes (e.g. one is rare compared to the others). For this class as well, it can be used `shuffle=True` to shuffle the data points' order before splitting into folds.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a1e456bb-0357-4596-b21c-01b1f6b01c3a","_uuid":"ed6ff2a72e7669ccc9888f8b5a5680d8d792c2c5"},"source":"### Scale Features\nA common good practice in machine learning is feature scaling, normalization, standardization or binarization of the predictor variables.

If we don't tune the algorithms well, performance will be poor with low accuracy, precision or recall. Most of the machine learning algorithms contain a set of parameters (hyperparameters), which should be set up adequately to perform the best. While all of the algorithms attempt to set reasonable default hyperparameters, they can often fail to provide optimal results for many real world datasets in practice. To find an optimized combination of hyperparameters, a metric is chosen to measure the algorithm's performance on an independent data set and hyperparameters that maximize this measure are adopted.\n\nTuning the models is a tedious, time-consuming process and there can sometimes be interactions between the choices we make in one step and the optimal value for a downstream step. Hopefully, there are two simple and easy tuning strategies, grid search and random search. Scikit-learn provides these two methods for algorithm parameter tuning. `GridSearchCV()` allows us to construct a grid of all the combinations of parameters passing one classifier to pipeline each time, tries each combination, and then reports back the best combination. So, instead of trying numerous values for each tuning parameter, `GridSearchCV()` will apply all the combinations of parameters - not just vary them independently - avoiding local optima.\n\nThe power of `GridSearchCV()` is that it multiplies out all the combinations of parameters and tries each one, making a k-fold cross-validated model for each combination. Then, we can ask for predictions and parameters from our `GridSearchCV()` object and it will automatically return to us the best set of predictions, as well as the best parameters.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline, FeatureUnion\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\n# Create the scaler.\nscaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0,1))\n\n# Scale down all the features (both train and test dataset).\nfeatures = scaler.fit_transform(features)\n\n# Create a train/test split using 30% test size.\nfeatures_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(features,\n                                                                            labels,\n                                                                            test_size=0.3,\n                                                                            random_state=42)\n\n# Create the classifier.\nclf = KNeighborsClassifier()\n\n# Create the pipeline.\npipeline = Pipeline([('reduce_dim', PCA()),\n                     ('clf', clf)])\n\n# Create the parameters.\nn_features_options = [1, 3, 5, 7]\nn_neighbors = [2, 4, 6]\nalgorithm = ['auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute']\n\nparameters = [\n    {\n        'reduce_dim': [PCA(iterated_power=7)],\n        'reduce_dim__n_components': n_features_options,\n        'clf__n_neighbors': n_neighbors,\n        'clf__algorithm': algorithm\n    },\n    {\n        'reduce_dim': [SelectKBest()],\n        'reduce_dim__k': n_features_options,\n        'clf__n_neighbors': n_neighbors,\n        'clf__algorithm': algorithm\n    }]\n\n# Create a function to find the best estimator.\ndef get_best_estimator(n_splits):\n\n    t0 = time()\n\n    # Create Stratified ShuffleSplit cross-validator.\n    sss = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=n_splits, test_size=0.3, random_state=3)\n\n    # Create grid search.\n    grid = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid=parameters, scoring=('f1'), cv=sss, refit='f1')\n\n    # Fit pipeline on features_train and labels_train.\n    grid.fit(features_train, labels_train)\n\n    # Make predictions.\n    predictions = grid.predict(features_test)\n\n    # Test predictions using sklearn.classification_report().\n    report = classification_report(labels_test, predictions)\n\n    # Find the best parameters and scores.\n    best_parameters = grid.best_params_\n    best_score = grid.best_score_\n\n    # Print the reports.\n    print(\"\\nReport:\\n\")\n    print(report)\n    print(\"Best f1-score:\")\n    print(best_score)\n    print(\"Best parameters:\")\n    print(best_parameters)\n    print(confusion_matrix(labels_test, predictions))\n    print(\"Time passed: \", round(time() - t0, 3), \"s\")\n    \n    return grid.best_estimator_\n\nget_best_estimator(n_splits=20)","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bf487a8d-c892-454e-b2c7-4a7d0aec235f","_uuid":"1d99eefcfdba0800dbe8bc24af3f1800f88d0627","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"d021a0b7-3932-459f-b7bc-0ff83ba75bfb","_uuid":"bc707ed3f7d895018f6e94b0f1570a67e7d25a26"},"source":"#### Combine PCA and Feature Selection with FeatureUnion\nOften it is beneficial to combine several methods to obtain good performance. `FeatureUnion()` will be used to combine features obtained by PCA and univariate selection, `SelectKBest()`. Combining features using this transformer has the advantage that it allows cross validation and grid searches over the whole process.

It can be a frustrating part of data science, especially if you're newer to the field and don't have a lot of experience. For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. One of the most important question you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\n> **Is this value missing becuase it wasn't recorded or becuase it dosen't exist?**\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doens't exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probalby do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing becuase it wasn't recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. (This is called \"imputation\" and we'll learn how to do it next! :)\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5cff158285ab37a89b80dcc35d5c690cdb42d3a4","_cell_guid":"1b17f4c9-dcab-4857-82f9-a2534e804c91"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Your turn!\n\n* Look at the columns `Street Number Suffix` and `Zipcode` from the `sf_permits` datasets.

I believe a better way of deciding whether that a value is missing or does not exist shall be based on its overall presence percentage; if a value is NaN for over 70% of total row numbers, I will say that the value does not exist.

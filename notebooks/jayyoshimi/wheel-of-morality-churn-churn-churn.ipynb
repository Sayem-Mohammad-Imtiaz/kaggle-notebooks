The farther down the top ten list we go, the more the churning and non-churning curves look like each other. That makes sense.<br><br>\nNext I'm doing 2-D kde plots for the top ten features.

I'm not super happy about how this turned out. I'm glad that I finally got all of these subplots and ax functions to compile, but I don't think that I'm getting any super simple relationships out of this. Probably because there are none in two dimensions.<br><br>\nI thought for a second that it might be interesting to add a third axis (requiring me to go and learn lots more code) so that I could visualize the relationships between three variables, but then I remembered that my monitor is two dimensional, so there would be no good way to look at the plots in relation to each other. Down this path lies madness. Anyway, that's what the ML algorithms are for, isn't it? To find patterns in higher dimensions that my monkey brain can't visualize?<br><br>\nI think that there's just no easy answer to the question \"how important is each feature?\". Clearly there is some clustering in higher dimensions that a decision tree can pick up on, since the random forest classifier was able to predict with such high recall, if not precision. I think that I just have to conclude that there is no terribly helpful information in each feature looked at in isolation, or even in pairs.<br><br>\nThis plot helped me see that there's a pretty interesting relationship for any of the features involving Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1. It looks like there's a pretty stark threshold for that feature that virtually all of the churning customers fall on one side of. Looking back at the plots of the distributions of each variable in isolation, I can see WHY this is. It looks like both the churned customers and non churned customers fall into normal-ish curves for both, and a good portion of the not-churning customers are not in a point of overlap with the churning curve.<br><br>\nAnd then I realize that this makes a lot of sense. Total_Amt_Chng_Q1_Q4 is itself a combination of two variables. Clearly there is some clustering pattern on a plot of amtchgQ1 and amtchgQ4, and the financial institution this data comes from has already recognized it. Good on them, but I'm left here thinking that there (probably) remains no decisive clustering in 2 dimensions. When looking at any two of the features I worked with on that plot, the churning customers simply have a lot of overlap with not-churning customers, and no pair can by itself identify the churners.<br><br>\nAlso, a point of clarification: on those plots, orange dots represent churning customers and blue ones represent not-churning ones. Individual dots are too small to show up clearly, which made the overal legend I had here earlier unhelpful. I don't care to try and work out a way to improve the plots, and I don't see anything promising to use in these plots, so I'm staying out of that rabbit hole, thank you."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This notebook explores sales/transfers made by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to state and local Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). From what I understand, state and local agencies might not pay the \"acquisition value\" for equipment. In some cases they may get the items for practically nothing under the provisions of a federal program. I use the terms purchase, transfer, and acquire interchangeably here.\n\nThere is one finding that surprised me. Transfers increased dramatically in 2012-13 and then steeply fell. The timing coincides with US troops leaving Afghanistan and the military drawdown announced in 2012. The trend suggests that purchases/transfers to domestic law enforcement are driven more by supply-side factors vs. economic factors or secular trends.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not advocating for or against equipment purchases and/or militarization of police. I am curious to see what equipment LEAs have acquired and trends over time.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport skmem","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sales = pd.read_csv('../input/police-violence-racial-equity/police_info/dod_equipment_purchases.csv', parse_dates= ['Ship Date'])\nsales.columns = sales.columns.str.translate(str.maketrans({\" \": \"_\", \"(\": None, \")\": None})).str.lower()\n\nsales = sales.fillna(-1) \\\n             .assign(demil_ic = lambda x: x.demil_ic.astype(int)) \\\n             .iloc[:, :-1]\n\nmr = skmem.MemReducer()\nsales = mr.fit_transform(sales, float_cols=['acquisition_value'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The table below shows the most common items transferred since 2010.

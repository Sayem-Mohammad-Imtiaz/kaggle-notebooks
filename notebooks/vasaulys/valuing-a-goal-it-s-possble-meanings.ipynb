For a sport as popular as association football is, I’m surprised there isn’t a lot of numbers being used in its analysis. So I’ve gone ahead and tried my best impersonation of Bill James in coming up with one way to evaluate players.\n\n*Note: This won't run as I use a couple of bespoke files. You'll have to download the data and keep it in the same directory to run this notebook.*"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b70dcd966729686710c6161339b65c21709e91ae"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Sabermetrics is baseball statistics taken to an extreme, leveraging computers to evaluate players and teams in often unconventional ways. You can see this in the Oakland A’s 2002 season when they won an at-the-time record of 20 wins. The team and their approach is immortalized in the book Moneyball by Michael Lewis.\n\nLooking at Association Football or Soccer — as I’ll call it — often has these stats being left out in favor of more traditional methods of evaluating players. I decided to crack open a recent Kaggle dataset and take a deeper look at trying to evaluate these players.\n\nFirst, we’ll start with goals\n\nTracking the number of goals scored is an important starting point, but it doesn’t happen enough in a game to be statistically significant. A top ranking team in the English Premier League like Manchester City only scored 80 goals in the entire 2016–2017 season. That comes out to ~2.11 goals a game. Given the size of a squad, evaluating players solely on their goal production seems an inefficient way to judge them, especially if they don’t score often.\n\nA better way to evaluate a player is to look at how often he attempts a goal and how often that particular shot-on-goal converts into a real goal. There should be enough data on attempts on goal to make this a meaningful number. It’s similar to the Corsi statistic used in evaluating hockey players.\n\nSo this is a two fold notebook: first is to look at how shots convert into goals (and goals into games). Second is to look at what types of shots on goal resulted in goals what percentage of time.\n\nFrom this, I could evaluate players based on their ability to take those types of shot. My intuition was that players who take shots on goal that rarely convert into goals are to be valued less than players who take shots on goal that are likely to convert.\n\nNote that this is far from a perfect analysis. For instance, defensive players are not evaluated here (the data I have does not record defensive maneuvers so they are more difficult to evaluate). I also took a lot of assumptions in order to make this work, which I’ll note when I can as the analysis progresses.\n\nThus, don’t take it as an end-all-be-all of soccer offensive player analysis, but instead take it as a starting place to look at player contributions in soccer teams."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8bfb81662c34734ad850c3cd74a86afbd917b208"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## First Steps\n\nFirst we need to import all of our data.

Cristiano Ronaldo [is considered by many to be the best ever](https://www.quora.com/Is-Cristiano-Ronaldo-the-best-soccer-player-of-all-time) so having him at the top makes a lot of sense. The other players are also of similar caliber. None of them are defensive players, which again makes a lot of sense. \n\nThe one outlier of [Jorginho Frello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorginho_(footballer,_born_1991)) having played only 11 games in this dataset makes sense as he doesn't have enough data to properly train. I actually find it surprising he's the _only_ outlier here. We could adjust for the minimum number of games a player needs to be in in order to appear, but 10 feels fair given the typical soccer league has ~40 games in a season. That means a player needs to appear in a quarter of the games in order to be here, which feels fair (though admittedly gut-feeling).

More thorough analysis would want to look at defensive players. If I had the data, I'd use possession time as the baseline metric, again taking inspiration from Hockey statistics. \n\nAlso, it would be helpful to look at players' net shot conversions to see what types of players they are. Perhaps they convert more often on certain shots than the typical average. However, I'm not 100% convinced there's enough data in this set to support such an analysis. \n\nThoughts? Questions?

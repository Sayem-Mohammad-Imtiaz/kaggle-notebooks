At the top of the English football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL; known as \"The Football League\" before 2016â€“17). Welsh clubs that compete in the English football league system can also qualify.\n\nFantasy Premier league is a game in which participants assemble an imaginary team of real life footballers and score points based on those players' actual statistical performance or their perceived contribution on the field of play. Fantasy premier league has evolved in recent years from a simple recreational activity into a significant business due to exposure via the internet.\n\nin this notebook, I will try to extract some information by using a statistical visualization. I don't have any objective in this project. I just retrive as much information from this data. I would be really happy if i got some feedbacks from you or you point out some mistakes.\n\ncheers."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7d700686-bbf8-4425-a042-0bda3bc7171f","_uuid":"4d110ffd8ef614f2128c81970611948ca68bf278"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

As the X-values increase (move right), the Y-values tend to increase (move up). The more expensive the player(High FPL value) tend to produce more FPL point. but as the FPL player, we tend to make a statergy to choose the cheapest player possible who can produce the highest FPL points. That is why I create one more variable which is FPl ratio. FPL ratio is the raton between FPL points and FPL value. I used FPL ratio to determoned the size of the point. so the bigger the point, the more likely player you should put in your fantasy team."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"785d3fa1-9ee5-4eec-a176-f450f86de9e8","_uuid":"2b135971cfdd75176ea36b2ea05a530a5b009a54"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","source":"#df['fage_pointration'] = pd.DataFrame(df['fpl_points']/df['fpl_value'])\ntrace1 = {\n  \"x\": df['age'],\n  \"y\": df['fpl_points'],\n  \"marker\": {\n    \"color\": 'red',\n    \"colorsrc\": \"Aldemuro:22:1a1899\",\n    #\"size\": df['fpl_ratio']\n  }, \n  \"mode\": \"markers\", \n  \"name\": \"fpl_points\", \n  \"text\": df['name']+\", Club:\"+df['club']+\", Pos:\"+df['position'],\n  #\"textsrc\": \"Aldemuro:22:5dc54a\", \n  \"type\": \"scatter\", \n  \"uid\": \"0d217c\", \n  \"xsrc\": \"Aldemuro:22:d61533\", \n  \"ysrc\": \"Aldemuro:22:1c3243\",\n  \n}\ndata = [trace1]\n#data = [trace]\nlayout = {\n  \"autosize\": True, \n  \"hovermode\": \"closest\",\n  \"title\": \"Relation between FPL points and player age\",\n  \"xaxis\": {\n    \"autorange\": True, \n    \"range\": [3.48535752785, 13.0146424722], \n    \"title\": \"player age\", \n    \"type\": \"linear\"\n  }, \n  \"yaxis\": {\n    \"autorange\": True, \n    \"range\": [-17.5245518316, 281.524551832], \n    \"title\": \"fpl points\", \n    \"type\": \"linear\"\n  }\n}\n# Plot and embed in ipython notebook!\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\npy.iplot(fig, filename='basic-scatter')"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3f41bc01-5865-4648-bc8b-93a3ad479b8d","_uuid":"af616341c81b065664e1da6e79cdd829da569869"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Scatterplot above are useful for interpreting trends between players age and FPL points.

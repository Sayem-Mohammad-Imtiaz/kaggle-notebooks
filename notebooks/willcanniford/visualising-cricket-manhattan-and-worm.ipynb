The Manhattan plot is essentially a breakdown of the runs scored and wickets taken in each over of a game displayed as a bar chart. 'Thw Worm' is a line graph that plots the runs of both teams against one another so for any given point in the game you can see how many runs they had. \n\nBoth involve aggregating the data to over-level. I will do this first and show you how to aggregate the ball by ball data available into a useable format for these graphics.

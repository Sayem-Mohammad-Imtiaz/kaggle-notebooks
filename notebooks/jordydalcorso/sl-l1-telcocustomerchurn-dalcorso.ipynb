{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1)Open the Telco Customer Churn dataset page in Kaggle.\n* By looking at the overview tab I understood this data are about customers (each row is a customer) of a telco company and the aim is to find out which clients are going to leave the company.\n\n2)Check the main properties of this dataset in the “Data” tab.\n* We have 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).\nThe “Churn” column is our target.\n\n3)Download the dataset into your computer.\n* It is a .csv file (172 KB). It is not compressed\n\n4)Uncompress the file\n* See above\n\n5)Open the uncompressed file by both a text editor and a spreadsheet software\n* Comma separates columns while rows are separated by \\n (a capo).\n* Senior citizen has binary value (0,1) while Partner has binary values (Yes,No) but in this case they are strings.\n\n6)Generate a new notebook for analyzing this dataset\n* I followed the instructions.\n\n7)Open the notebook documentation page to get help if needed\n* Not needed\n\n8)Select the first cell (we will call it “Library import cell” in the following), run it\n* There is no output (since it doesn't print nothing because I still have not loaded the dataset).\n* Import numpy library which contains useful stuff used to deal with mathematical calculations. See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/ for more\n* Import the pandas library which contains useful stuff used to deal with statistic and data processing. See https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ for more\n* Import os library which containts useful stuff used to deal with importing and converting data and many more. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html\n* It seems no data ar available atm\n\n9)Add to the first cell new lines to load the following libraries: seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model (only LogisticRegression)\n* Done\n\n10)Select the first cell and add a new cell on top of it\n* Done\n\n11)Select the new cell and transform it in a “Markdown” cell, then copy all the text in this pdf file and paste it in the new Markdown cell\n* Done\n\n12)Please write your answers to the questions above in the new Markdown cell. From now on you can use the same cell to write your answers as well\n* Done\n\n13)Select the “Library input cell” and add a new cell below it\n* Done\n\n14)Use the new cell to load the Telco Customer Churn dataset into a Pandas DataFrame variable called data. Hint: find similar code in the Titanic notebook if needed. Remind to run the cell after writing the code-box\n* Done\n\n15)Add the following comment before data loading line: “Data acquisition”\n* Done\n\n16)Add also a Markdown cell before the data loading cell and write in bold the text “Data acquisition”. Markdown cells should be used to give a structure to the report, hence they should be added before each new section\n* Done\n\n17)In a new cell show the number of rows, the number of columns, and the total number of cells in the dataset\n* The number of customers is 7043. \n* The number of attributes is 21. \n* The number of cells is 147903.\n\n18)Add the following comment at the beginning of the cell: “Dataset dimension”\n* Done\n\n19)Add a new markdown cell before this cell and write in it the title “Data Analysis”\n\n* Done\n\n20)In a new cell show the names of the variables in the dataset\n* customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents, tenure, PhoneService, MultipleLines,InternetService,  OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingT, StreamingMovies, Contract,  PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Churn\n\n21)In a new cell show the first and last 10 rows in the dataset\n* Done\n\n22)In a new cell show i) the type of variable data, ii) the number of missing values for each variable, iii) the type of each variable, iv) the total memory used to store variable data\n* How many missing values are there in total? 0\n* Which variables are categorical? The ones which are not numerical (see below)\n* Which variables are numerical? SeniorCitizen (binary), tenure, MonthlyCharges\n\n23)In a new cell show the following basic statistics for all numerical variables: number of non- missing values, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, 1st and 3rd quartiles\n* I used the method data.describe()\n\n24)In a new cell show the following basic information for all categorical variables: number of non-missing values, number of unique values, most frequent value and frequency of the most frequent value.\n* I used the method data.describe()\n\n25)In a new cell show the histograms of each numeric variable (i.e., column) in the dataset\n* I used the method data.hist()\n\n26)In a new cell show the box-plots of each numeric variable (i.e., column) in the dataset\n* I used the method data.boxplot()\n\n27)In a new cell show the histograms of the categorical variables in the dataset\n* I used the methods sb.countplot() and sb.subplots()\n\n28)In a new cell generate a new DataFrame called data1 and containing only variables gender, Partner, MonthlyCharges, Churn\n* I used data1 = data[[...]] with the columns I wanted to keep\n\n29)In a new cell show the first 5 rows of the new dataset\n* Again I used the method data1.head(5)\n\n30)Convert categorical values in data1 to numeric as follows:\n* Done using function .map()\n\n31)Generate a separate Series variable called data1Churn for the dependent (churn) variable and drop it from DataFrame data1\n* I used the function iloc[] to create the Series\n* i used the method drop() to drop the column Churn.\n* data1[[‘Churn’]] is a DataFrame with one column and data1[‘Churn’] is a Series\n* So single brackets refers to Series while double brackets to DataFrame\n\n32)Generate a linear logistic model using data1 as dependent variables and data1Churn as independent variable, then show the model “score”\n* I used class LogisticRegression() and method fit(). Then I printed the coefs associated to the 3 independent variables\n\n33)Show the parameters of the linear logistic model computed above. Which variable seems to be more related to customer churn?\n* The variable which is more related to churn seems to be Partner, with a coef of -0.83873431. This means that having a partner and churn are negatively correlated.\n\n34)If you want, click on the Sharing field on the right hand side menu and share the notebook with me (Kaggle user: albertocastellini)\n* Done"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sb\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data acquisition**\n\nIn the next cell the telco-customer-churn dataframe is imported"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Data acquisition\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Analysis**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Dataset dimension\nprint(\"The number of customers is\", data.shape[0] )\nprint(\"The number of attributes is\", data.shape[1])\nprint(\"The number of cells is\",data.shape[0] * data.shape[1])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Columns names\nfor column_name in data.columns:\n    print(column_name)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#First 10 rows in the dataset\ndata.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Last 10 rows in the dataset\ndata.tail(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Basic informations about the dataset\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Basic statistical indexes about the dataset\ndata.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Histograms showing the distribution of values of the numerical variables.\ndata.hist(['SeniorCitizen','tenure','MonthlyCharges'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Seems this command automatically put boxplots all in the same figure\n#Boxplots of numerical variables\ndata.boxplot(['SeniorCitizen','tenure','MonthlyCharges'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#I'm not really sure about this point\n\nsb.countplot(y='SeniorCitizen', data=data, color=\"c\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#New dataset from the existing one with less attributes (not sure if this is a new copy or a pointer)\ndata1 = data[['gender', 'Partner', 'MonthlyCharges', 'Churn']]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#This is how the new dataset looks like\ndata1.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#gender: Male=0, Female=1 • Partner: No=0, Yes=1 • Churn: No=0, Yes=1\n#Converting binary categories to numerical binary values\n\ndata1['gender'] = data1['gender'].map( {'Male': 0, 'Female': 1} ).astype(int)\ndata1['Partner'] = data1['Partner'].map( {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1} ).astype(int)\ndata1['Churn'] = data1['Churn'].map( {'No': 0, 'Yes': 1} ).astype(int)\n\n#This is how the ds looks like after the process\ndata1.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#The method (I don't think this is a method) iloc extract only the fourth column of the ds\n#The method drop() delete the column from the dataset.

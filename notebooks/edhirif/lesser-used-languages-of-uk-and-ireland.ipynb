The UNESCO website defines the 'Extinct' catagory as \"there are no speakers left>>included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s\".

Another problem with these numbers is-what does it mean to speak a language? Does it mean the person should be a native speaker, or can it include people who became fluent in later life, and what about people who have some level of fluency but are not at native speaker level. The Cornish language had to be reconstructed because the last native speaker died before audio recording equipment became available, she died in 1777. So does that mean that language is extinct and can never be brought back?\nThe above gives the number of Irish speakers as just over forty thousand (there are at least three times as many Polish speaking people living in Ireland) but I have seen the number of Irish speakers quoted as over one million. Politicians, the media and other commentators in Ireland will use a strict or non-strict definition of 'speaker' depending on which suits their political agenda.\nThere is also the question of what is a language and what is a dialect - many people, including the majority of people who speak Scots in Scotland do not consider Scots to be a language - see [here][1] for a report by the Scottish government. \nThe topic of lesser used or minority languages is often politically sensitive, it is absolutely worth studying and it is important for us as a species to maintain our cultural diversity but I would treat the data in this dataset with some caution.\n\n  [1]: http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2010/01/06105123/4"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

However duplicates can have different values for the same fields. For exampe S# 176 and 177 are duplicates - they refer to the same event. But in the first row the number of people killed is put at 12, injured at 8 and total at 20, whereas for S# = 177 the numbers are 13, 3 and 15. \n\nLatitude and Longitude values are also different for duplicate incidents. \n\nI would also question the number of incidents in the dataset. There are 398 rows, including duplicates. The site http://www.shootingtracker.com/ lists 383 mass shootings in the USA in 2016 alone. I think this dataset may give a false impression about the scale of the mass shooting problem in the USA.\n\nEliminating the duplicates is tricky since the latitudes and longitudes are often different for identical rows so I can't use those columns to identify duplicates. Instead I will assume that the number of occassions when there was more than one mass shooting on a given date in this dataset is a small number. I will then eliminate duplicates based on the Date column and hope that I don't lose too much good data. A more sophisticated approach could include also looking at the latitude and longitude values, if they are within some error band (say + or - 1%) then they are duplicates.

The East coast does not display these tight clusters. Is this maybe due to differences in population densities on the East and West coasts? (Populations are more clusterered on the West coast(?) and mass shootings are maybe more common in areas of higher population density(?))\n\nIn summary:\nThe frequency of attacks has increased in recent years, 2015 and 2016 were particularly bad years. However the overall trend is not simply upwards, there have been more peaceful periods for example between 2000 and 2005. While this year (2017) has seen the worst attack ever in terms of total casualties there have been fewer incidents in total. Unfortunately the outliers - the attacks that see large numbers of fatalities are getting worse. In the 60s and 70s the worst attacks saw fewer than 20 fatalities. Two recent attacks saw the total around or above 50 for each attack. I do not see any evidence to suggest that people are more or less likely to survive this kind of incident now compared to the past, but I imagine the weapons available to the shooters will have changed over the decades. Certainly the very high number of casualties in the recent shooting in Las Vegas was partly due to the kind of weapon(s) used. Geograpphically incidents seem to cluster around larger urban centers, this is especially true on the West Coast. There is a cluster of incidents in WA many of which are within the last 5 or 6 years, there are not many older events in WA.","cell_type":"markdown"}],"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4}

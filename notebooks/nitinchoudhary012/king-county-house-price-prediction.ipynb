individual house sold.\n#### 4. **bedrooms**: It is integer variable represents how many bedrooms in a particular house.\n#### 5. **bathrooms**: It is numeric variable shows the number of bathrooms in house.here,values are decimal and represent as- Full bathroom(room with bathtub,toilet,sink and shower) = 1, Half bathroom(room with a toilet and sink but no shower) = 0.5, Room with toilet,sink and shower = 0.75\n#### 6. **sqft_living**: It is Numeric continuous variable shows the total area(interior living space) of the house in square feet.\n#### 7. **sqft_lot**: It is Numeric continuous variable shows the total area of plot(land space) which includes garden and ground of properties in square feet.\n#### 8. **floors**: It is categorical variable represent number of floors in house that can be half values also(like 1.5,2.5 etc.)\n#### 9. **waterfront**: It is categorical variable.The waterfront variable is 0 if the house does not have any waterfront view and 1 if does.\n#### 10.

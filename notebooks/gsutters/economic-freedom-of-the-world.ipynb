Size of Government, #2. Legal System and Property Rights, #3. Sound Money #4. Freedom to Trade Internationally, and #5. Regulation of credit, labor, and business. Each component (and sub-component) is placed on a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 represents more freedom. \n\nWhen comparing the levels of economic freedom for years 1980 and 2016, we see that the least free country in 1980 had a score of 2.66, whereas the least free country in 2016 scored 2.88. The max scores for 1980 and 2016 were 8.73 and 8.97, respectively. The mean also increased between 1980 and 2016 from 5.61 to 6.80. Note that in 1980 only 113 countries were analyzed.

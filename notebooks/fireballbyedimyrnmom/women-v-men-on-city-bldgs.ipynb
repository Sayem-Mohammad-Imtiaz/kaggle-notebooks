Those rows with multiple people named in buildings consist of **relatives** (family, spouses, etc.). Only 1 building has the name of two men only. These are **outliers** for the purpose of this notebook. 7 represent a pair on the building name, 6 were male and female pairs, 1 a male-only and 3 represent a family and do not differentiate the number of females or males.   \n\nThere are men represented in more than one building. George R. Moscone shows in 6 buildings, Harvey Milk in 3, J. M. Woods in 3. M. H. de Young in 2, and so do H. Welton Flynn and Curtis E. Green. For the purpose of this notebook, removed repeated individuals. All of those with more than one building are **male**.   \n\nAfter removing 12 outliers, **41** buildings have the name of a man, **19** of a woman.    \n\nWomen are represented in most departments, but their represetation is small, compared to men. Women have low representation in those departments labeled as **RED** (there is no meta-data explaining what RED stands for), and on **ports**. Women have zero representation in the **SFMTA**, **airports**, or **PUC** (there is no meta-data explaining what PUC stands for). Women are presented the most in **Administration** buildings."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python 3 environment with analytics libraries installed\n# as defined by the kaggle/python Docker \n\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n#visualization libraries\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/women-representation-in-city-property-sanfrancisco/WomenRepresentaionInCityProperty-SanFrancisco.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe(include='all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The columns Current Police Districts, Current Supervisor Districts,\tAnalysis Neighborhoods, Neighborhoods, SF Find Neighborhoods have a single value.

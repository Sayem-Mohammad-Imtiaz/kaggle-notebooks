short survival rate.\n* At 90th% there if nodes detected is greater than 8 nodes then it has high survival status and if nodes are greater 20 then patients will have less survival rate.\n* Probability

Conclusion:\n* This dataset is imbalanced and much overlapping and very hard to classify.\n* Having said this, 'Age' and 'Nodes' feature gives us more insights compare to other features.\n* If we

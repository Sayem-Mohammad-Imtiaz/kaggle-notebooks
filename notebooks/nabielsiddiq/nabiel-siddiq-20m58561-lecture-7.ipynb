However, based on the catalog, there is a huge earthquake, with magnitude of about 8.3 richter scale, occurred in the Kermadec Island, northern part of New Zealand. Fortunately, there is no inhabitant on the island, thus no casualties resulted from the event. Several damages did happen in the island since the eartquake caused around 300 landslides, which in overall reform parts of the natural landscapes there.\n\nThe eartquake actually generated a small tsunami that affect surrounding islands, even up to Australia (64 cm), Fiji (13 cm), and Tonga (6 cm).

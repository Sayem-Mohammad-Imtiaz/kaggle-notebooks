Recency (R), frequency (F) and monetary (M) scores are assigned to each customer separately. This score gets a score from 1 to 5 We get our RFM score by combining the novelty (R), frequency (F), monetary (M) scores side by side as a single score. However, the interpretation of this scoring may vary according to the field of activity of the enterprise or firm.\nFor example, if your business is a car business, you expect your customers to make high-priced purchases, but the frequency of purchases and innovation time will be low. Therefore, interpreting individual scores under these conditions gives more accurate results.\n\nRecency — (R)\nFrequency — (F)\nMonetary — (M)\n\n* Recency: How recently the customer made a purchase\n* Frequency: Frequency of the customer's purchase\n* Monetary: How much money the customer spends on purchases\n    \n> RFM analysis numerically scores a customer on a scale of 1 to 5 in each of these three categories (the higher the number, the better the result). The “best” customer gets the highest score in each category (555).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://d35fo82fjcw0y8.cloudfront.net/2018/03/01013508/Incontent_image.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step by Step RFM Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1) Let's Explore the Dataset:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use the data set named “online_retail_II” in our RFM Analysis.

recommend working on those customers. Moreover, it will be relatively easy to move them to Loyal Customers status. For the same reason, the \"Need Attention\" group also stands out as a segment that should be emphasized. Similar to these, the \"Loyal Customers\" segment is very important and profitable for the company due to the monetary value it brings. However, similarly, \"Cant Loose\" customers, although highly profitable, are very few in number. As a general strategy, we may aim to move customers in the Cant loose, At Risk and Need Attention segments to the Loyal customers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

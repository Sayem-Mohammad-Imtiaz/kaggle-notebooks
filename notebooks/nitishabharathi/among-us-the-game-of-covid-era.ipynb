When an indie game company created Among Us in 2018, it was greeted with little fanfare. The multiplayer game remained under the radar as many games do - until the summer of the pandemic.</p>\n    \n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To all the Among Us newbies here is a brief explanation of how the game works.\nAmong Us is a multiplayer game where between four and 10 players are dropped onto an alien spaceship. Each player is designated a private role as a 'crewmate' or 'impostor'. Crewmates must run around the ship and try to complete a set of tasks while trying to root out and avoid getting killed by the one or several impostors. Players can be voted off the ship, so each game becomes one of survival: Successfully vote off the impostors, or complete all your tasks to win.\n\n</p>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><strong><center>Dataset Description</center></strong></h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>Game Completed Date - Date and Time of game completion</li>\n  <li> Team - player is an imposter or crewmate</li>\n  <li>Outcome - Fine result of the game - win/loss</li>\n  <li>Task Completed - The number of tasks completed by the crewmate</li>\n  <li>All Tasks Completed - Boolean Variable showcasing if all the tasks are completed by the crewmate</li>\n    <li>Murdered - Crewmate is mudered or not</li>\n    <li>Imposter Kills - Number of kills by the imposter</li>\n    <li> Game Lengh - Total duration of the game </li>\n    <li>  Ejected - The player is ejected by the fellow players or not </li>\n    <li> Sabotages Fixed - Number of sabotages fixed by the crewmates </li>\n    <li> Time to complete all tasks - Duration taken by the crewmates to complete the tasks </li>\n    <li> Rank Change - Change in rank after the win/loss of the game </li>\n    <li> Region/Game Code - Server and the game code </li>\n</ol>\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport os\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px \n\nfiles = os.listdir('../input/among-us-dataset')\ndata = pd.concat([pd.read_csv('../input/among-us-dataset/' + f) for f in files ])\n\ndata['Murdered'].replace('No','Not Murdered',inplace=True)\ndata['Murdered'].replace('Yes','Murdered',inplace=True)\ndata['All Tasks Completed'].replace('Yes','Tasks Completed',inplace=True)\ndata['All Tasks Completed'].replace('No','Tasks Not Completed',inplace=True)\ndata['Ejected'].replace('Yes','Ejected',inplace=True)\ndata['Ejected'].replace('No','Not Ejected',inplace=True)\n\ndata_crew = data[data['Team'] == 'Crewmate']\ndata_imp = data[data['Team'] == 'Imposter']\n\nteam = data['Team'].value_counts()\nimposter_percent = (team['Imposter']/data.shape[0])*100\ncrewmate_percent = (team['Crewmate']/data.shape[0])*100\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2><strong><center>Why Always Crewmate?</center></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> This is something all the among us players can relate.

Before applying any AI or ML technique on the data set, it is extremely important to observe the basic properties of the data and therefore EDA is performed.\n    - In simple way: Before solving a question, we have to read it and observe the things/facts given in the question. Once it is observed, we can go ahead to solve it. EDA is performed for similar purpose.\n    \n- What do we do in EDA?\n    - We apply maths, statistics, plotting techniques and various scientific methods and observe the meaning of the results produced by those various techniques.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7b7763bd18d36ff6d219e7851f37fac309fda179"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Dataset: Haberman Survival\n- Study was conducted between 1958-1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients, undergone surgery for breast cancer.\n\n   1.

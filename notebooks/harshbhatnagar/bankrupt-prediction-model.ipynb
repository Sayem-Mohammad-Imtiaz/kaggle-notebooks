Okay, the skew may not be extremely severe (it can vary), but the reason we identify imbalanced classification as a problem is because it can influence the performance on our Machine Learning algorithms.\n\nOne way the imbalance may affect our Machine Learning algorithm is when our algorithm completely ignores the minority class. The reason this is an issue is because the minority class is often the class that we are most interested in. For instance, when building a classifier to classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions from various observations, the data is likely to have more non-fraudulent transactions than that of fraud — I mean think about it, it would be very worrying if we had an equal amount of fraudulent transactions as non-fraud."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_x=dff.iloc[:,0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from collections import Counter \nprint(Counter(data_x))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Random OverSampling\n\nRandom Oversampling includes selecting random examples from the minority class with replacement and supplementing the training data with multiple copies of this instance, hence it is possible that a single instance may be selected multiple times."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\n\n\n\nover_sample=RandomOverSampler()\nX_ros, y_ros=over_sample.fit_resample(y,x)\nprint(Counter(y_ros))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(X_ros.shape)\nprint(y_ros.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(y_ros.reshape(-1,1).shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"dff.hist(figsize=(20,20),edgecolor='white')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_ros, y_ros, random_state=76)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(X_train.shape)\nprint(y_train.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Training KNN Model "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"best_n = 0\nbest_training = 0\nbest_test = 0\n\nfor i in range(1,10):\n    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=i)\n    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    training = knn.score(X_train, y_train)\n    test = knn.score(X_test, y_test)\n    \n    if test > best_test:\n        best_n = i\n        best_training = training\n        best_test = test\n\nprint(\"best number of neighbors: {}\".format(best_n))\nprint(\"best training set score : {:.3f}\".format(best_training))\nprint(\"best test set score: {:.3f}\".format(best_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I hope you understand this notebook . \nPlease don't forget to upvote .

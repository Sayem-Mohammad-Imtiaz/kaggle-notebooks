The covid-19 in South Korea began to break out on 02 / 20 / 2020. It was first spread through the “Shincheonji Church of Jesus”. It was also the most serious epidemic area in early Asia except China. But South Korea controlled the outbreak on March 3, and the number of new cases per day began to decline, only taking 14 days. It can be said that the performance of the Korean government is relatively excellent, so why?\n2. The most important point is that South Korea has greatly improved the virus detection efficiency, reaching 20000 every day. So that Korea can quickly and accurately detect. At the same time, South Korea began to conduct free testing for the public very early, so the number of tests completed in South Korea every day is many times that of other countries.\n3. March 23, Covid-19 alert level was raised to the highest level only 2 days after the outbreak, and the largest blockade was imposed on Daegu and Gyeongbuk. The strict blockade system will prevent the epidemic from spreading throughout the country.\n4. After controlling the epidemic situation, South Korea did not relax its vigilance and took measures to prohibit the entry of foreign personnel or quarantine them for 14 days.","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

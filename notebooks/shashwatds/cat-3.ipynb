We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance.\n\n> If we notice there is feature as study time and if we see correlation between study time and grades they are highly related from this feature we can predict a student's grades that whether if a student study more will he get more marks or not."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"https://www.kaggle.com/shashwatds/cat-3?scriptVersionId=44348619"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

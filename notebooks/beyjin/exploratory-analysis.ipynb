It might be more like that the type of heart desease might differ which results in small deviations. \n\nIt would´ve been really interesting to know some more information about their lifestyle. My assumptions are that the lifestyle as well as the psyche has an high impact on a heart desease. \n\nAs always -- feedback is welcome :-)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

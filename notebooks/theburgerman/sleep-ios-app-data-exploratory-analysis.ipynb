Walker outlines extensive research on how sleep affects our moods, dietary preferences, our body's ability to fight cancer, physical & mental aptitude, among a host of other ideas to which Walker proposes that our lack of sufficient and quality sleep may explain some of today's issues. This book, along with Michael Pollan's recent 'This is your Mind on Plants' book with the section about caffeine history and information, instilled a sense of curiosity to see if I could do a bit of my own digging in a sleep dataset to uncover something of interest (if anything).\n\n## The Dataset\n\nThis dataset was provided via: https://www.kaggle.com/danagerous/sleep-data which notes that it was collected over a four year period utilizing the Sleep Cycle app from Northcube on iOS.\n\n### Import Necessary Packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T03:01:05.090897Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T03:01:05.091417Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.192948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T03:01:05.09131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.191862Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import Sleep Cycle iOS App .csv Data\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/sleep-data/sleepdata.csv\", sep = ';')\n\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.194431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.194811Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.244937Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.194777Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.24407Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.dtypes","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.246636Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.247218Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.254801Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.247166Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-18T03:01:06.25401Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Cleaning the Data\nChecking the .head() of our dataframe shows that we need to do some cleaning up before we can begin exploring this dataset.

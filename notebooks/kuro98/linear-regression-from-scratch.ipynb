It includes abundance data on the larvae of over 250 species of fish; larval length frequency data and egg abundance data on key commercial species; and oceanographic and plankton data. The physical, chemical, and biological data collected at regular time and space intervals quickly became valuable for documenting climatic cycles in the California Current and a range of biological responses to them. CalCOFI research drew world attention to the biological response to the dramatic Pacific-warming event in 1957-58 and introduced the term “El Niño” into the scientific literature.\n\"\n\nMore information about this dataset can be found [here](https://new.data.calcofi.org/index.php/database/calcofi-database/bottle-field-descriptions).\n\nIn this task, I will first read the data into a Pandas Dataframe, remove the redundant variables, and then use the remaining to perform a multivariate regression analysis.

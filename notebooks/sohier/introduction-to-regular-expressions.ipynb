They are useful for a wide range of tasks where you're starting with messy text. Need to standardize the entries users made to a webform? Identify the authors from a collection of newspaper articles? Remove all emoji from dataset? Regex can do all of those and more.\n\nThe good news is that regular expressions are incredibly powerful. The bad news is that this power means regular expressions can be complicated: the first book on regex I checked is over 500 pages long. Fortunately, even the most basic regular expressions enable you to do things that would be frustrating or impossible with basic string processing tools. \n\nWith that in mind, this tutorial is shows you what regex can do and where to look for new commands in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) or a [cheat sheet](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/python). For each of the concepts we cover I'll provide some example use cases and then provide questions that will require you to look up new commands.\n\n### Core Tools\nThere are a few tools and concepts we need to cover before we start matching patterns. These web pages will be helpful, though you don't need to read through them just yet:\n- [Regex cheat sheet](https://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/python): defines the regex commands we'll be working through.\n- [Pythex](https://pythex.org/): this regex tester shows what regex pattern matches. This is especially useful when you get a different number of matches than you expected.\n- [Practice Problems](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/exercises-for-intro-to-regular-expressions/): this kernel has both warmup and advanced exercises.\n\nPython uses regular expressions through the `re` library. It has several regex functions, but you only need two to get through most use cases:\n- `re.findall`: returns a list of all matching strings.\n- `re.sub`: substitutes matching strings.\n\n### The Basics\nThe simplest type of regex matches complete substrings in the same way as normal Python string processing."},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"14db5d77-3883-4e09-998d-3e2ef31cd5f2","_uuid":"7aa95fc721ec7fbbbe5d61fae0619f1e164e284c","collapsed":true},"execution_count":null,"source":"import re","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4737525e-e473-44da-8efe-e6dab09cc163","_uuid":"6c3992403d1e1b1183ba51e8b374e804ef7ec971"},"execution_count":null,"source":"print('I would like some vegetables.'.replace('vegetables', 'pie'))\nprint(re.sub('vegetables', 'pie', 'I would like some vegetables.'))","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0e24a63b-03f5-477b-ae41-0a7ad232c74f","_uuid":"f27dd7e6da6d4ecd2182fecd232ab4f768ec87d7"},"source":"The advantages of regex start to become more clear if we need to make more than one replacement:"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"646633e9-2ee4-46f2-b0ce-57bdc1d18ceb","_uuid":"4f70b27da16c983ed7be7dfd8c96db8ecb4b8772"},"execution_count":null,"source":"veggie_request = 'I would like some vegetables, vitamins, and water.'\nprint(veggie_request.replace('vegetables', 'pie')\n    .replace('vitamins', 'pie')\n    .replace('water', 'pie'))\nprint(re.sub('vegetables|vitamins|water', 'pie', veggie_request))","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"040c32b2-2faf-4405-8c3a-bde5f863abf7","_uuid":"0b32b3d1512d2ee2cb77127b10350e8034f8cf42"},"source":"I used the metacharacter `|`, the regex \"or\" operator, to shorten the command.

For example, the special character `\\D` matches all non-digit characters and makes it trivial to do do basic phone number cleanup:"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fd6539f0-69ac-49d8-be5d-cd28bd26abcc","_uuid":"a00e1473323619ce5944754dc3a29c860acf5f38"},"execution_count":null,"source":"messy_phone_number = '(123) 456-7890'\nprint(re.sub(r'\\D', '', messy_phone_number))","outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"56f0d635-6b22-4910-b2b2-7410131cb151","_uuid":"06f661369d800ef084842d7f6db1929155e94560"},"source":"You may have noticed that I the added raw string prefix `r` before my pattern. This allows us to specify special characters with a single `\\` rather than `\\\\`.

If a user entered some letters into the phone number, we might want to raise an error for that entry rather than try to clean it up. A better option is to define a custom character set to narrow down what we delete.

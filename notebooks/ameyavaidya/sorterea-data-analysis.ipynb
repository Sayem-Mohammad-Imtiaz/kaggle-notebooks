In addition,I would try to fit a logistic regression model to the dataset in order to find out whether we could predict the severity of an accident by inputting a variety of factors. This data analysis confirmed my hypothesis that inclement weather causes more severe accidents and that certain junctions and road features also cause more high profile accidents. This shows us that there are a lot of important factors to consider when looking at the severity of accidents and the presence of accidents around the country.

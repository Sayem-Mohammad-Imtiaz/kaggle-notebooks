You will pick a real-world dataset of your choice and apply the concepts learned in this course to perform exploratory data analysis. Use this starter notebook as an outline for your project . Focus on documentation and presentation - this Jupyter notebook will also serve as a project report, so make sure to include detailed explanations wherever possible using Markdown cells.\n\n### Evaluation Criteria\n\nYour submission will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n\n* Dataset must contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows of data\n* You must ask and answer at least 4 questions about the dataset\n* Your submission must include at least 4 visualizations (graphs)\n* Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, apart from the code.\n* Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted for somewhere else.\n\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.\n\n\n### Step 1: Select a real-world dataset \n\n- Find an interesting dataset on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv\n- The data should be in CSV format, and should contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows\n- Download the dataset using the [`opendatasets` Python library](https://github.com/JovianML/opendatasets#opendatasets)\n\nHere's some sample code for downloading the [US Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset):\n\n```\nimport opendatasets as od\ndataset_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset'\nod.download('https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset')\n```\n\nYou can find a list of recommended datasets here: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/recommended-datasets-for-course-project/11711\n\n### Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning\n\n- Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas\n- Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.\n- Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data\n- Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc.)\n\n\n### Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization\n\n- Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns\n- Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.\n- Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.\n- Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis\n\n### Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data\n\n- Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset\n- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn\n- Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary\n- Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib etc. explain briefly what it does\n\n\n### Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion\n\n- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis\n- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections\n- Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets\n- Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis\n\n\n### Step 6: Make a submission & share your work\n\n- Upload your notebook to your Jovian.ml profile using `jovian.commit`.\n- **Make a submission here**: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/course-project\n- Share your work on the forum: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/course-project-on-exploratory-data-analysis-discuss-and-share-your-work/11684\n- Browse through projects shared by other participants and give feedback\n\n\n### (Optional) Step 7: Write a blog post\n\n- A blog post is a great way to present and showcase your work.  \n- Sign up on [Medium.com](https://medium.com) to write a blog post for your project.\n- Copy over the explanations from your Jupyter notebook into your blog post, and [embed code cells & outputs](https://medium.com/jovianml/share-and-embed-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-jovian-ml-df709a03064e)\n- Check out the Jovian.ml Medium publication for inspiration: https://medium.com/jovianml\n\n\n\n\n\n### Example Projects\n\nRefer to these projects for inspiration:\n\n* [Analyzing StackOverflow Developer Survey Results](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-eda-stackoverflow-survey)\n\n* [Analyzing Covid-19 data using Pandas](https://jovian.ml/aakashns/python-pandas-data-analysis) \n\n* [Analyzing your browser history using Pandas & Seaborn](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/understanding-my-browsing-pattern-using-pandas-and-seaborn-162b97e33e51) by Kartik Godawat\n\n* [WhatsApp Chat Data Analysis](https://jovian.ml/PrajwalPrashanth/whatsapp-chat-data-analysis) by Prajwal Prashanth\n\n* [Understanding the Gender Divide in Data Science Roles](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/exploratory-data-analysis-eda-understanding-the-gender-divide-in-data-science-roles-9faa5da44f5b) by Aakanksha N S\n\n* [2019 State of Javscript Survey Results](https://2019.stateofjs.com/demographics/)\n\n* [2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)\n\n\n\n**NOTE**: Remove this cell containing the instructions before making your submission.

You can also mention about the course [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](zerotopandas.com), and what you've learned from it."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How to run the code\n\nThis is an executable [*Jupyter notebook*](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Jovian.ml](https://www.jovian.ml), a platform for sharing data science projects. You can run and experiment with the code in a couple of ways: *using free online resources* (recommended) or *on your own computer*.\n\n#### Option 1: Running using free online resources (1-click, recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to start executing this notebook is to click the \"Run\" button at the top of this page, and select \"Run on Binder\". This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n\n\n#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n\n1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n\n2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n\n```\nconda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8 \nconda activate zerotopandas\npip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n```\n\n3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n\n```\njovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n```\n\n\n\n4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n\n```\njupyter notebook\n```\n\nYou can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser. Click on the notebook file (it has a `.ipynb` extension) to open it.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Downloading the Dataset\n\n**TODO** - add some explanation here"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Instructions for downloading the dataset (delete this cell)\n>\n> -

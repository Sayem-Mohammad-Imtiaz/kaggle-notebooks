The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file. The team identifies the following customer variables to study: product purchased, TM195, TM498, or TM798; gender; age, in years;education, in years; relationship status, single or partnered; annual household income ($); average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week; average number of miles the customer expects to walk/run each week; and self-rated fitness on an 1-to-5 scale, where 1 is poor shape and 5 is excellent shape. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each CardioGood Fitness treadmill product line.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of content:\n- ### I)Data Preprocessing:\n    -

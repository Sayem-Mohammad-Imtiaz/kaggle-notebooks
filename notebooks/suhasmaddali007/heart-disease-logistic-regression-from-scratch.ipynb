It is available in **scikit - learn library**. However, it is always better to know how the algorithm actually works rather than relying only on the libraries. In libraries, one might not get an intuitive sense of how the algorithm works in the back end. Understanding the code from scratch would always be a good approach rather than just using the libraries. \nSo, I've coded the entire part without using scikit - learn library for logistic regression.I tried to simplify and use various functions (with the help of **Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization**) that are actually the ones that are used in scikit - learn in the back end. \nI've coded this from scratch and the model was able to achieve** 88 percent accuracy** on the testing set that is considered to be quite good for a model coded from stratch. \nLet us now start our journey to understand how this algorithm actually works. Before we dive into the algorithm, it is always good to **visualize the data** at hand and see if there is any relationship between various parameters. \n\n**Part - I**\n\nThis deals with the visualization of various input parameters and understand the data thoroughly. In addition to this, it is also important to discard some other parameters that are not worth much consideration. \n\n**Part - II**\n\nThis deals with the definition of various helper functions that would be later used by the main function at the end of the code. These helper functions would make the execution much simpler and divide the work flow. Therefore, just by looking at the function, one could get to know it's functionality. \n\n**Part - III** \n\nIn this part of the code, we would define the main function that would take various arguments (hyperparameters) used to train the model. The body of this main function contains all the helper functions that we have already defined. \n\n**Part - IV**\n\nThis is the last part of the code. Here, we would define actually run the whole model with **various hyperparameters** and measure the training and the test accuracy. It turns out that the **training accuracy is 85%** (approx) while the** test accuracy is 88%**. We can see clearly from the accuracy in the test set that the model is not suffering from either overfitting (variance) or underfitting (bias) to a large extent. \n\nThis is the outline of the entire code. Feel free to comment in the end if there is any doubt or query. I'd be glad to help!!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas

It is considered a basic skill for data arranging and preprocessing when programming in python. When you are learning python from skretch it is probabily pretty obvious how to use the library. But with an SQL biased mind as mine it might be quite a bit confusing in some places. \n\nBy now I'm using the library for about two years as part of my ML hobby in my spare time, but I'm still spending a lot of time on stackoverflow to get things done. It's time to digg into Pandas, and recalibrate my awareness how to deal with data. \n\nThis notebook I translate some common and some advanced techniques from SQL to pandas step-by-step. I didn't just want to write a plain cheat sheet (actually Pandas has a good one to get started: [Comparison SQL](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html)). I also wanted to unwind some concepts that might be helpful for a SQL developer who now and then deals deals with pandas.\n\n# Technical setup\n\nThe scripts will load the data into Pandas DataFrames (e.g. `df_colors`) and also into SQL tables (e.g. `colors`). You can choos between **SQLite** (because it's part of the basic python setup) or **BigQuery** (because it's fun to learn something new).\nThe code below is written so you can use either SQL database.  Though you need to make very few changes to the code if you use BigQuery. I marked the code with a `#BQ` or `--BQ` where you have to adjust. \n\nThese are changes you have to make when using BigQuery:\n- set the `USE_BIGQUERY` flag to `True`,\n- uncomment the `<<` in the `%%sql` magic line where SQL output is written to a DataFrame (The notebook overrides the `%%bigquery` magic as `%%sql` so the code doesn't need to be changed any further.).\n- Connect your google account to the notebook session (in the notebook menu: Add-ons ==> Google Cloud Services).\n- Set your cloud project_id.\n\nAdditional changes when running BQ on kaggle:\n- On the first run %%BIGQUERY didn't work because of credential issues. The next day after restarting the notebook and browser it just worked.\n- Setting the `default_dataset` on the magic didn't work on kaggle notebooks. So you have to add the dataset in the SQL-code cells to every table (e.g. `colors` --> `lego.colors`).\n\n> **Warning !**\n> \n> If you use **BigQuery** keep in mind that the scripts might generate costs and you get charged! Don't use it in Production environment or with an account pointing to a Production environment!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# BQ:\n\n# Either use BigQuery (True) or SQLite (False)\nUSE_BIGQUERY = False\n# Set your own gcp project id here\nBQ_PROJECT = 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'\n\n## BigQuery related settings\n# if using BigQuery, drop and recreate tables (True)\nRECREATE_BQ_TABLES = True\nDATASET_ID = 'lego'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!sqlite3 lego.db .databases .quit","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sqlite3\nimport sqlalchemy\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n# import sql2pandas_config\n\n#https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\nfrom google.cloud.bigquery import magics\n\n# Path to Google credentials (*.json)\n# os.environ[\"GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\"]=sql2pandas_config.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\nin_path = Path('../input/lego-database')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ==== CONFIG ====\n\n# sql magic\nif USE_BIGQUERY:\n\n    %load_ext google.cloud.bigquery\n    # define %%sql as an alias for %%bigquery\n    %alias_magic sql bigquery\n\nelse:\n    # load jupyter extention\n    %load_ext sql\n    # disable autocommit\n    %config SqlMagic.autocommit=False\n\n#%matplotlib inline\n#%pylab inline\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# ==== Set up BigQuery ====\n\nif USE_BIGQUERY:\n\n    client = bigquery.Client(project=BQ_PROJECT) \n\n    default_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(\n        default_dataset = f'{BQ_PROJECT}.{DATASET_ID}',\n        maximum_bytes_billed = 100000000\n    )\n    client.default_query_job_config = default_config\n    \n    # setting config to the %%sql magic \n    magics.context.default_query_job_config = default_config\n    magics.context.project = BQ_PROJECT\n    \n    ##

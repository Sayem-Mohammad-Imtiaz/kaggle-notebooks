Introduction and objectives\n\nOur objectives are:\n* We want to train some models to solve the classification problem (Edible / Poisonous). \n* We want to create a feature relevance ranking, that will help us to understand what information is more helpful in this problem.\n* We want to have fun!\n\nIn order to train and evaluate our models we need to define some scores. We propose the following metrics:\n* Accuracy\n* F-score \n* Area Under the Curve (AUC_ROC)\n\nWe will validate the parameters of our models using the F-score, that is calculated using Precision and Recall. We will consider that the positives are cases of Poisonous mushrooms, which means that false negatives are critical (deadly, indeed) and should be avoided. On the other hand, having a big number of false positives is not so problematic, because an Edible mushroom is not supposed to kill anybody. Consequently, we need to have a Recall close to 1, and a Precision as high as possible. We will focus on the F1-score, that will compute the harmonic mean of both metrics."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ded3361e-47e3-8db6-d8d5-76fdcbe044e3"},"source":"# 2.

The non-linear model produces the highest scores possible, which means that despite the linearity level of the dataset it is necessary to introduce non-linearities for a perfect fitting.\n* The most relevant feature is 'odor'.

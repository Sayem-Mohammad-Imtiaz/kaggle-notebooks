We have a dataset which based on certain paramaters classifies a voice based on gender. How do humans do it?\n> Sound waves travel into the ear canal until they reach the eardrum. The eardrum passes the vibrations through the middle ear bones or ossicles into the inner ear. The inner ear is shaped like a snail and is also called the cochlea. Inside the cochlea, there are thousands of tiny hair cells. Hair cells change the vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain through the hearing nerve. The brain tells you that you are hearing a sound and what that sound is.\n> \n\nWhat happens in the brain is neurons perform certain operations to classify the sound, this is exactly what we will be trying to simulate. We will try to mimmic the functioning (on a much*1000 smaller scale) just to get the basic idea.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 1**\n\nImport the basic libraries \nmatplotlib :: To plot graphs\n    numpy  :: To perform operations and manipulate arrays\n    pandas :: To read and manage the data from the file","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Step 2**\n\nWe need to separate the dependent and independent variables.

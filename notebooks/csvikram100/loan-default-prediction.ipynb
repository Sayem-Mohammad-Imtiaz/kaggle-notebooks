work, please upvote this kernel as it will keep me motivated to do more in the future and share the kernel with others so we can all benefit from it .\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nIn this kernel ,I will try to show you how different models can improve just by doing simple process on the data .\n\nwe are going to work on **binary classification problem,** where we got some information about sample of peoples , and we need to predict whether we should give some one a loan or not depending on his information . we actually have a few sample size (614 rows), so we will go with machine learning techniques to solve our problem .\n\n**\nwhat you will learn in this kernel ?**\n\n* basics of visualizing the data .\n* how to compare between **feature importance **(at less in this data) .\n\n* feature selection\n* feature engineer\n\n* some simple techniques to **process** the data .\n* handling **missing data** .\n* how to deal with **categorical** and **numerical** data .\n*** outliers** data detection\n* but the most important thing that you will learn , is how to **evaluate your model** at every step you take .\n**\nwhat we will use ?**\n\n* some important libraries like **sklearn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, seaborn, scipy**\n* fill the values using **backward 'bfill' method** for numerical columns , and **most frequent value** for categorical columns (simple techniques)\n* 4 different models to train your data, so we can compare between them\n\n**a) logistic regression\n\nb) KNeighborsClassifier\n\nC) SVC\n\nd) DecisionTreeClassifier**\n\n**Note :** I am writing this kernel while i am still studying and learning about this field , so if there is any mistake i have made, please feel free to tell me in the comment below, and you can ask me any question about this kernel .\n\nSo let's start\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing some important librarys\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport

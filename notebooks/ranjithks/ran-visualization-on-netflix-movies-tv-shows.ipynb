After renters had finished with the DVDs, they would simply post them back.\n\nRentals were around $4 plus a $2 postage charge. After significant growth, Netflix would switch to a subscriber-based model. \n\nWith this model, users could keep the DVDs for as long as they liked but could only rent a new movie after returning their existing one.

But in case you are still stumped, the name Netflix is a combination of \"Net\" (common parlance abbreviation of the internet\" and \"Flix\" (a common abbreviation of \"flicks\" which n turn is slang for a movie or film). "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How was Netflix founded?\nAt the time Netflix was founded, Marc was working as a marketing director for Hasting's company Pure Atria. He was also the co-founder of MicroWarhouse (a computer mail-order company).\n\nHasting would later sell Pure Atria to the Rational Software Corporation in 1997 for $700 million. \n\nBy all accounts, the pair came up with the idea for Netflix during a commute between their homes in Santa Cruz and Pure Atria's HQ in Sunnyvale prior to Pure Atria's acquisition and merger. \n\nReed would supply the seed capital and invested $2.5 million into the startup in cash. Inspired by Amazon's e-commerce model, the pair explored various portable items they could use to sell over the internet in a similar fashion.\n\nAfter initially considering and rejecting VHS cassettes, they settled on DVDs as the perfect product. After testing their idea by posting one to their homes in Santa Cruz, and it arriving in perfect condition, they decided the time was right to break into the market with their new revolutionary model.\n\nNetflix launched in April of 1998 and became the world's first online DVD rental and merchant.

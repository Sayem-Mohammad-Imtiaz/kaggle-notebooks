Data correlation is a way to understand the relationship between multiple values or features in your dataset.\n\nEvery single successful data science project revolves around finding accurate correlations between the input and target variables. However more than often, we oversee how crucial correlation analysis is. \n\nIt is recommended to perform correlation analysis before and after data gathering and transformation phases of a data science project.\n\n There are three different types of correlations:\n\n* Positive Correlation: Two features (variables) can be positively correlated with each other. It means that when the value of one variable increases then the value of the other variable(s) also increases (also decreases when the other decreases).\nEg. The more time you spend running on a treadmill, the more calories you will burn.\n\n* Negative Correlation: Two features (variables) can be negatively correlated with each other. This occurs when the value of one variable increases and the value of another variable(s) decreases (inversely proportional).\nEg. As the weather gets colder, air conditioning costs decrease.\n\n* No Correlation: Two features might not have any relationship with each other. This happens when the value of a variable is changed then the value of the other variable is not impacted.\nEg. There is no relationship between the amount of tea drunk and level of intelligence.\n* Each of these correlation types exists in a spectrum represented by values from -1 to +1 where slight or high positive correlation features can be like 0.5 or 0.7.\n* A very strong and perfect positive correlation is represented by a correlation score of 0.9 or 1.\n* If there is a strong negative correlation, it will be represented by a value of -0.9 or -1.

It can tell you about your outliers and what their values are. It can also tell you if your data is symmetrical, how tightly your data is grouped, and if and how your data is skewed.\n\nBox plots divides data into its quartiles. The “box” shows a user the data set between the first and third quartiles.\n\nThe median gets drawn somewhere inside the box and then you see the most extreme non-outliers to finish the plot. Those lines are known as the “whiskers”. If there are any outliers then those can be plotted as well.\n\nWith box plots you can answer how diverse or uniform your data might be. You can identify what is normal and what is extreme. Box plots help give a shape to your data that is broad without sacrificing the ability to look at any piece and ask more questions.\n\nIt displays the five-number summary of a set of data.

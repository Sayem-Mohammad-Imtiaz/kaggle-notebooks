These earthquakes are believed to be caused by the 9.0 magnitude Tohoku earthquake that occurred in 2011. It is astonishing that a single earthquake has changed the seismic landscape of northern Honshu and the Japan Trench.  \n  \nThere have been far more earthquakes in the decade after the 2011 earthquake than in the decade before the 2011 earthquake.  Therefore the earthquake incidence rate is much higher than the pre-2011 level.\nAccording to the data, in the 90 years prior to the Tohoku earthquake, the incidence of earthquakes of magnitude 6.8 or greater was 0.58 per year.In the decade after the Tohoku earthquake, the rate was 2.04 per year (3.5 times higher), and in the short period after February 13, the rate was 13.5 per year (another 6.5 times higher).\nThese increases in earthquake rates are judged to be due to the \"Coulomb stress change\" caused by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake, which brought the surrounding faults closer to rupture.  \n  \nThe three magnitude 7 earthquakes are all aftershocks of the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 2011. Those aftershocks are not over yet, and there is a possibility that more major earthquakes will occur in the future. However, it will not be at an unprecedented speed like the last 80 days.","metadata":{}}]}
